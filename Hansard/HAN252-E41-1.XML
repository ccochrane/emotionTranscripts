						</PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3351373"> moved that Bill <Document DbId="6077022" Type="4">C-489, an act to amend the Criminal Code and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (restrictions on offenders)</Document>, be read the second time and referred to a committee. </ParaText><ProceduralText TocType="TPC" id="1">Bill C-489. Second reading</ProceduralText><ParaText id="3351374"> He said: Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="170609" Type="2">Chilliwack—Fraser Canyon</Affiliation> for seconding this motion.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351375">I am honoured to stand here and speak on my new Bill C-489, which is also called the “safe at home bill”. I do so on behalf of my constituents in Langley and other young victims who have lived in fear of their offenders. I am in awe of their bravery and courage to fight for the rights of future victims. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351376">In my riding of Langley, two brave families lived in constant turmoil when the sex offenders of their children were permitted to serve house arrest in their neighbourhoods. In one case, the sex offender served a sentence right across the street from the victim, and in the other case, right next door. That is outrageous. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351377">Neither child felt safe in their home or their neighbourhood, which is the very place where they should feel the safest. Their doors were locked and the blinds were kept closed. Every time they saw the sex offender the entire family was re-victimized. The families lived in continual turmoil as they watched the offenders possibly looking for an opportunity to reoffend or hurt somebody else. Their homes in the neighbourhoods that they had loved were now places they dreaded because their attackers were there. One family could not take the stress any more, which forced them to move out of the neighbourhood they had spent so many years loving.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351378">One mother came to my office and asked me, “Why should we have to move from our home when we are the victims?” That is a good question. Everyone should have the right to feel safe in their home, and victims of sexual assault should be no exception. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351379">This is why I brought forward Bill <Document DbId="6077022" Type="4">C-489</Document>, which I believe meets these important concerns head-on. If passed, the bill would help to ensure the safety of victims and witnesses from convicted offenders. It would enhance the level of confidence that victims have in the justice system as well as help them feel that the justice system is hearing and responding to their concerns. The bill would achieve these objectives by proposing a number of amendments to the Criminal Code and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351380">Bill <Document DbId="6077022" Type="4">C-489</Document> would prevent offenders, when released from prison, from contacting victims or witnesses. Specifically, the bill proposes that when an offender is convicted of a child sexual offence, the sentencing court would be required to consider imposing a specific geographic restriction of two kilometres from any dwelling in which the offender knows or ought to know that a victim may be present as well as a condition prohibiting the offender from being alone in any private vehicle with a child under the age of 16. Efforts to prevent contact between offenders and their victims should serve to increase public safety and victims' confidence in the sentencing process.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351381">The bill would also require courts to impose conditions in all probation orders and conditional sentencing orders prohibiting an offender from communicating with any victim or witness, or from going to any place identified in the order. Although these conditions would be mandatory, the court could decide not to impose them if the victim or witness consented or if the court found exceptional circumstances, in which case written reasons would be required to explain the findings. I believe this would enhance public safety and confidence in the justice system by helping to ensure that victims and witnesses would not be contacted by offenders upon their release into the community except in exceptional circumstances or where the individual consents.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351382">The bill also proposes to amend recognizance or peace bonds against individuals when there is a reasonable fear that they may commit a future child sex offence. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351383">Specifically, the bill proposes to amend Section 810.1, peace bonds, to require a court to consider imposing conditions prohibiting the defendant from contacting any individual or going to any place named in the recognizance. As with the proposed probation and conditional sentence order amendments, the court could choose not to impose the conditions in the peace bond where there is consent of the individual or where the court finds exceptional circumstances. This amendment would also lead to enhanced public safety for victims and witnesses.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351384">Lastly, Bill <Document DbId="6077022" Type="4">C-489</Document> proposes to amend the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, or the CCRA, to require decision-makers under that act to consider similar conditions. I would like to consider this amendment a bit more fully.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351385">Currently under the CCRA, Parole Board of Canada tribunals and correctional officials are authorized to impose conditions on an offender when the individual is being released into the community under parole, stat release or temporary absence orders. This type of gradual and supervised conditional release into the community prior to the expiration of sentence is intended to help ensure public safety and successful reintegration of the offender into society. This is especially true where the offender has been imprisoned for many years and will have difficulty re-entering society without a carefully planned and monitored release strategy that includes tailored conditions and specialized programs that the offender must abide by at all times.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351386">According to the 2012 Conditional Services of Canada annual report, there are currently about 22,000 offenders under the authority of the federal corrections system. About two-thirds of these offenders were convicted of a violent or sexual offence. About 38%, almost 9,000 offenders, are at any given time under active supervision in the community by corrections officers. All 9,000 of those offenders are required to abide by a mix of mandatory and discretionary conditions imposed by the authority of the CCRA. If offenders breach their conditions, they are subject to disciplinary measures, including having their conditional release revoked and being required to serve out the remainder of their sentence in prison. As the CCRA is currently structured, Section 133 provides the authority of the Parole Board of Canada, for example, to impose at its discretion any type of condition that meets the two objectives of conditional release. The first and primary consideration is public safety.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351387">The second consideration is the successful reintegration of the offender into the community. Section 133 also references the regulations of the CCRA regarding mandatory conditions of release. Under this legislative authority, Section 161 of the regulations prescribes a number of specific conditions that must be imposed for all offenders in the community under conditional release, such as reporting as required to their parole officer, not possessing any weapons and reporting any changes in their address or employment, among other things.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351388">While it is not uncommon for the Parole Board of Canada under the current regime to exercise its discretion to impose conditions prohibiting contact between offenders and victims when released, the point is that these are not mandatory conditions nor are these conditions that the Parole Board of Canada is required to consider under the current Section 133. I spoke earlier about the two cases in my riding of Langley where the victims and their families felt that their welfare had not been taken into account when these decisions were made by the Parole Board of Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351389">One of the objectives of Bill <Document DbId="6077022" Type="4">C-489</Document> is to respond to these types of concerns. It proposes new mandatory conditions prohibiting the offender from communicating with any identified victims or witnesses and from going to a place identified in the condition. This objective is entirely consistent with the government's initiatives that have provided a greater emphasis on safer communities in general and victims in particular.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3351390">As with the bill's other proposed amendments, the releasing authority would not have to impose the condition if there were exceptional circumstances or if the identified individual consented. These two exceptions would ensure that the provision is flexible enough to accommodate the types of circumstances that would undoubtedly occur in practice.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351391">Where the releasing authority does find that exceptional circumstances do exist, reasons for making that finding must be provided in writing explaining how it came to that conclusion. I believe this requirement would ensure that victims and witnesses better understand the Parole Board's decisions. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351392">I expect that the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights will want to fully consider this bill and its operational impacts to ensure that it operates as intended and that its objectives are fully achieved.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351393">Public confidence in our justice system is important. It pains me to hear from victims of crime that they have to speak out to say that they have been forgotten and that the justice system does not consider how sentencing affects them. This is a gap that Bill <Document DbId="6077022" Type="4">C-489</Document> seeks to address and I believe it hits the mark. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351394">I hope by tabling this bill that this House and this government will act to enhance public safety by holding criminals accountable, by enhancing the voice of the victims and by making victims feel safe in their homes and neighbourhoods. I ask for support from the hon. members in the House in helping to get the bill passed into law so that young victims and their families can feel safe at home and in their neighbourhoods.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I understand that the Subcommittee on Private Members’ Business studied the bill and deemed it votable, which is why we are now considering it in the House. However, the clerk stated that clause 1 of the bill, amending subsection 161(1) of the <I>Criminal Code</I>, could pose problems. He pointed out that although this clause was not clearly unconstitutional, it could still face a constitutional challenge.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351397">I would therefore ask my hon. colleague whether he consulted with constitutional experts—other than the law clerks who help us draft bills—to ensure that the bill was indeed constitutional.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I started working on this bill about two years ago. It was initiated by a Langley resident who came to my office and asked the important question, “If we are the victims, why should we have to leave our home?”</ParaText><ParaText id="3351399">The experts have indicated that the bill is sound. It would provide the courts the discretion they need. Therefore, I believe it would withstand the challenge. The experts have told me so.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

There are many victims in this country who have never felt as if they have been heard.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351401">Our government has done much. It is a government for the victims. As the member has described the bill today, I would like to ask him this. It seems unconscionable that a family would have to close their blinds or run away from the perpetrator after it has been proven that he or she has committed a violent or sexual act against a minor. Could the member expand on what it is like for the constituents in his riding to have to endure this because often as parliamentarians we forget how difficult it is for victims?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We need to make sure those persons deal with what has caused them to commit that offence. However we also need to consider the victims. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351404">In one case the offender lived right next door to the victim's family. In another case, the victim's family lived right across the street from the offender. Every time they saw the offender cutting the lawn, being out and living life quite normally, it created a huge turmoil in the victim's family. The stress it created on the family was intolerable and eventually they had to move out. The neighbourhood used to have barbecues. It was a very tight, close neighbourhood. It all ended when the offender was permitted to serve the sentence at home. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351405">We need to consider the rights of the victim.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

In the initial draft of my bill, it was a five-kilometre separation. We quickly found that would not be practical and changed it to two. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351409">That may not be practical in certain circumstances. That is why the bill provides discretion to the courts. They do not necessarily have to do this, but they would have to provide a reason why not. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351410">Two kilometres sets the standard. If two kilometres does not work in certain circumstances, it would be adjusted to what is practical. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351411">The principle is, though, that a victim should not have to see, on a daily basis, the offender serving the sentence right across the street from them. The courts will determine what is reasonable.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Boivin" id="8020678"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170299" Type="2">Ms. Françoise Boivin (Gatineau, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3351412">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House to speak to Bill <Document DbId="6077022" Type="4">C-489</Document>, introduced by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170478" Type="2">Langley</Affiliation>. This important bill certainly addresses a number of problems that many people have raised, including the ombudsman for victims.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351413">The New Democratic Party does not play political games with bills amending the Criminal Code. We feel it is better to address serious issues and solve serious problems in a logical way that is consistent with the Criminal Code.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351414">Since I like to get straight to the point, I will say to the member opposite that we are going to support his bill at second reading. We believe that everyone in the House should be concerned about victims, not for a political purpose, but because we really want to help them on the path to recovery—if there is such a path, because it is not always clear. Some horrible crimes cause such terrible harm that, regardless of what we can do to mitigate things, regardless of anything we can do, it will never go away.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351415">To follow up on the question I asked my colleague about Bill <Document DbId="6077022" Type="4">C-489</Document>, I think the study by the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights will help us see if the bill can pass the charter compatibility test. When the Subcommittee on Private Members' Business was studying the bill, the clerk said that it was not clearly unconstitutional, but that it could be susceptible to a constitutional challenge. That sends a message. The committee will determine if this passes the compatibility test.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351416">When she asked her excellent question, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170748" Type="2">Abitibi—Témiscamingue</Affiliation> clearly said that, for a number of reasons, it might be difficult to apply Bill <Document DbId="6077022" Type="4">C-489</Document> in some cases. For one thing, it would prevent someone from moving to an area near the victim. That implies that the criminal serving a sentence would know where the victim lives, which seems problematic to me. Something about that bothers me.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351417">However, as I told my colleagues when we were studying Bill <Document DbId="6077022" Type="4">C-489</Document> before recommending that it be supported at second reading, I appreciate that some discretion was left to the courts. The committee will also have to verify whether the courts will be able to fully exercise their discretion.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351418">This discretion should not be seen as some undefined power. The public sometimes sees it as being soft on criminals, to the detriment of victims. Here, it simply means that judges will look at the facts of each individual case.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351419">In some circumstances, it may be difficult to set certain conditions. For example, it may be more difficult in a town than in a city, where the offender could live 5, 6 or 7 kilometres away.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351420">I appreciate how my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170478" Type="2">Langley</Affiliation> crafted his bill. He did not strip the courts of all discretionary power, as the government opposite so often does. That approach jeopardizes bills, even those that the Conservative government passes, because there is a large black cloud hovering over their heads, and it leads defence lawyers to challenge certain provisions.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351421">We cannot allow this legal game to even get started. We need to make it clear that the facts will be looked at on a case-by-case basis. Therefore, the best sentence will be applied in each situation, once the person is found guilty. The judge is in the best position to do that, or the jury in certain circumstances.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351422">That is why this bill is so important. We have been saying that all along, despite what is being said at press conferences. I am tired of hearing it, particularly from the <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation>. In my opinion, he should rise above the fray. The justice minister and Attorney General of Canada is not simply a political partisan, he is the keeper of Canadian laws. In that context, I feel that always bringing the debate back to “we're tough on crime, they're soft on crime” demeans his public office. It is a question of respect for the law.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3351423">All the NDP justice critics have taken this position. I would have liked to name them, but since I am not allowed to do so, I will just say that I am talking about the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170508" Type="2">St. John's East</Affiliation> and his predecessor. I can never remember the riding names. What matters is that I remember the name of my own riding.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351424"><B>An hon. member:</B> Windsor—Tecumseh.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351425"><B>Ms. Françoise Boivin:</B> Yes. It was the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170538" Type="2">Windsor—Tecumseh</Affiliation>. That is teamwork.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351426">We have always had this view of the law. We are making sure that the government respects justice. We never look at it from the perspective of what we want to accomplish. The government is there. It is in power until 2015. We may not be happy about it, particularly in light of the events that we followed with great interest during the week that we spent in our ridings, events that people were asking us about. Even though we did not want to get involved, we did not have a choice. I am talking about the magnificent chamber across the hall. Regardless, we believe that the law is sacred in Canada. Our country and our democracy are built on the rule of law.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351427">When we ask questions about the legality or constitutionality of a bill, it is not just to get in the government's way or because we are soft on crime. We do so because we abide by the rule of law.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351428">In closing, I would like to reiterate that the NDP will vote in favour of this bill at second reading. That is not a guarantee that we will support the bill at all stages. I will not go that far, because I have my doubts. Sometimes, we do not have any doubts about a bill and we support it right from the start. Sometimes, we are completely convinced that a bill does not work and so we vote against it. At the very least, this bill seems to be worthwhile and it shows respect for victims. What is more, we know what the Federal Ombudsman for Victims of Crime said in his report.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351429">The <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> is going from one press conference to another explaining that he is holding consultations to determine victims' needs. That sometimes makes me smile.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351430">We know what victims need. Victims have been telling us loud and clear for years.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351431">The Crown prosecutors' offices sometimes have difficulties consulting victims about criminal trials because they have an enormous number of files. This is not a criticism of the Crown prosecutors; they just are overwhelmed by the number of cases. There is a shortage of Crown prosecutors and judges, which means that trials go on endlessly. This increases the victims' suffering. It is a fact that the longer the trial, the more times the victim must return to court. The problems caused by the fact that they are victims of a crime are not considered. They get peanuts. The government may not like it, but even though its Bill <Document DbId="5507161" Type="3">C-37</Document> was passed, victims get peanuts.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351432">Moreover, victims are not always given an explanation of the sentences, even though they have many questions about them. People do not always have the time to explain them, and that is unfortunate.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351433">In that context, we support any measure that respects victims' rights and takes them into account in order to help victims. We want the sentencing system to be punitive and also to focus on rehabilitation. The NDP will always insist on this because these people will return to society. I would prefer them to be good citizens and not bad citizens who take to crime again. We must look at the whole picture. The government has to stop compartmentalizing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351434">I would like to once again thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="170478" Type="2">Langley</Affiliation> for introducing a very important bill that has our support at this stage.</ParaText>

We could say that the point of the justice system is, first, to reinforce acceptable norms of behaviour; second, to protect society from those who have proven that their actions can cause harm; and third, to ensure that only the guilty pay for their crimes and that the innocent are not convicted. These seem to be, in general, the overriding goals of our justice system, a system that has evolved slowly but surely over centuries.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351436"> It turns out that because the justice system is focusing on these three principles, often the interests of victims are ignored, albeit unintentionally. Bill <Document DbId="6077022" Type="4">C-489</Document> would attempt to provide some assistance to victims.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351437"> Bill <Document DbId="6077022" Type="4">C-489</Document> would deal mostly with sexual offences, though not exclusively, as I understand it. Sexual offences create a unique kind of vulnerability among the victims. They are a unique kind of violation compared to, for example, car theft or house break-ins when individuals are not at home. Both of those crimes create a terrible sense of vulnerability as well, but we are talking here of sexual offences and the particular sense of vulnerability they create.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351438"> I agree with the hon. member that the interests of victims of sexual crimes have often been overlooked in our criminal justice system. Liberals support the intent of Bill <Document DbId="6077022" Type="4">C-489</Document>. We are not certain that the bill would bring about meaningful progress in all cases for victims or prospective victims of sexual crimes. I say “prospective” victims, because the bill would also deal with recognizance orders, where an individual has not committed a criminal act but poses a threat to another person. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351439">We support sending the bill to committee to ascertain its merits in attaining a goal that, obviously, we all share in this House.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351440">I understand that the bill is motivated by the MP for <Affiliation DbId="170478" Type="2">Langley</Affiliation>'s particular experience with some victims in his riding. In fact, the member stated:</ParaText><ParaText id="3351441"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">[A] sex offender...was permitted to serve House arrest right next door to his young victim. In another case, the sex offender served House arrest across the street from the victim. In both cases, the young victims lived in fear and were re-victimized every time they saw their attacker.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3351442">Obviously, that situation, which the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170478" Type="2">Langley</Affiliation> described, leaves all members in disbelief and with a view that something should be done.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351443">Bill <Document DbId="6077022" Type="4">C-489</Document> would introduce two prohibitions through amendments to two laws. Number one, it would amend the Criminal Code, and number two, it would amend the Corrections and Conditional Release Act.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351444">In terms of Criminal Code changes, as I understand it, the bill would deal with subsection 161(1) of the Criminal Code, which allows conditions to be placed on offenders who receive conditional discharges for sexual offences. This discharge is sometimes granted in cases where the offence carries no minimum sentence and a maximum possible sentence of less than 14 years. In this case, as I understand it, the accused would not have a criminal record if all of the conditions imposed as part of the conditional discharge were respected.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3351445">Bill <Document DbId="6077022" Type="4">C-489</Document> seeks to add to the list of conditions that may be imposed by a judge. This is a very specific list, and as I understand it, the judge cannot impose conditions beyond this list. It is important that a specific point be made in adding this condition, because it is not something the judge could impose if he or she saw fit. We are talking about the condition that an offender must be no closer than two kilometres from the house where he or she knows or ought to know that the victim is alone. Similarly, another condition would be that the offender would not be allowed to be in a private vehicle with any person under the age of 16 without his or her guardians' consent.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351446">It is important to note that the list of possible conditions in this instance is finite. There is no flexibility here for the judge to impose other conditions beyond those listed. Therefore, this is the only place where adding conditions might make sense, since it gives the sentencing judge the ability to prohibit the offender from living near the victim. As I said, it is important to specify the condition, because there is no latitude for the judge to impose it.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351447">In the bill there is also a restriction on contacting victims. I am not sure if it pertains to those who have committed sexual offences. The bill extends the list of conditions the court must, or shall, prescribe for offenders on probation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351448"> At the moment, section 732.1 of the code has two sets of conditions. One set is conditions the judge shall impose. The second set is conditions the judge may impose.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351449">In this case, the bill would add a new “shall” condition. The court would have to impose this condition on an offender, for example, who is on probation or is under a conditional sentence. If it chose not to impose the condition, the court would have to explain, in writing, why it was not choosing to add this condition.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351450">We understand the intent of this part of the bill. What I would say is that, at the moment, the list of possible conditions for probation orders and conditional sentences both include “such other reasonable conditions as the court considers desirable.” In other words, in this case, the judge has the latitude to impose conditions that are not specifically prescribed on a list. Presumably, the court could already order offenders not to have contact with their victims or not to visit certain places, if it saw fit to do so.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351451">The point I am trying to make is that unlike the first amendment, about staying within two kilometres of where the victim would be residing, in this case, we have to ask ourselves if this particular amendment to the Criminal Code is necessary, given that the court already has the latitude to impose this condition.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351452">I congratulate the hon. member for bringing this bill forward. I know that he is attempting to address a very serious flaw in our criminal justice system. I look forward to discussing and studying the bill at committee so that we can see and understand the extent to which the bill achieves its stated goals.</ParaText>

					<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="40">(1140)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Bergen" id="8020994"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170861" Type="18">Ms. Candice Bergen (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Safety, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3351453">Mr. Speaker, I am very privileged to rise today to speak in support of private member's Bill <Document DbId="6077022" Type="4">C-489, An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (restrictions on offenders)</Document>, introduced by my colleague, the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="170478" Type="2">Langley</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351454">I want to begin by congratulating the bill's sponsor for the work he has put into this very important piece of legislation. I believe it is entirely consistent with our government's commitment to making our streets and communities safer for Canadians and to better meeting the needs and concerns of victims.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351455">The bill's objective is clear. It proposes to enhance the protection of victims and witnesses and to prevent their re-victimization when an offender is released into the community. It addresses concerns expressed by victims and witnesses across Canada that they should not have to feel threatened by the prospect of an offender watching them, following them, phoning them, or attempting to contact them in any way once they are released into the community. The bill meets this objective by targeting existing provisions that currently provide authority for conditions to be placed on offenders after they have been convicted of a criminal offence, or in some cases, if there is reason to believe that they will commit a child sexual offence.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351456">Generally speaking, the purpose of these types of existing conditions is to ensure public safety and the successful reintegration of the offender into the community. They are imposed at various stages of the process, such as at sentencing; for child sexual offender prohibition orders, probation orders and conditional sentence orders; just prior to release from prison on parole or conditional release orders; and before someone is charged, but there is a reasonable belief that he or she may commit a child sexual offence while under a peace bond.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351457">Statistics Canada data indicates that about 105,000 or more orders per year may be affected if Bill <Document DbId="6077022" Type="4">C-489</Document> becomes law. Our government will be supporting the bill while proposing amendments to ensure clarity and consistency and to take into account recent Criminal Code amendments.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351458">I would like to take a few moments to consider the first order Bill <Document DbId="6077022" Type="4">C-489</Document> proposes to amend, section 161 of the Criminal Code prohibition order. Under this section, at the time of sentencing an individual convicted of a listed sexual offence against a child under the age of 16, the court must consider imposing listed prohibitions, such as not attending public parks, school yards and other places where children are often present. While the current provision makes it mandatory for the court to consider these conditions, the court retains the discretion not to impose the order. The prohibition order takes effect upon the offender's release into the community and can last up to the lifetime of the offender.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351459"> First, the bill would require the court to consider imposing a geographical condition restricting the offender from being within two kilometres of any dwelling house in which a victim could reasonably be expected to be present without a parent or guardian. Second, it would require a court to also consider prohibiting the offender from being in a private vehicle with any child under the age of 16 without a parent or guardian. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351460">It is possible, however, that this two-kilometre limit may be challenging to implement, something I believe the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights should consider when it studies the bill. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351461">I also agree that a child sexual offender should not have unsupervised access to a child. In fact, members will recall that the Safe Streets and Communities Act amended section 161 of the Criminal Code by adding two new conditions: prohibiting the offender from having any unsupervised contact with a child under age 16 and prohibiting the offender from having unsupervised use of the Internet.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351462">The bill before us would also amend both the probation and conditional sentence provisions of the Criminal Code by prohibiting the offender from communicating with the victim, witnesses or any other person identified in the order or from going to any place specified in the order. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351463">These proposed new conditions would be mandatory whenever a sentence included a probation or conditions sentence order, with two exceptions. First, the court could choose not to impose the condition if the identified person in the order consented. Second, the court could decide not to impose the condition where it found that exceptional circumstances existed. In the latter case, the court would be required to provide written reasons explaining this decision. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351464">This proposed approach would provide the court with some flexibility, which I believe is needed. It is possible, however, that requiring written reasons for declining to make the order in exceptional circumstances may have some impact on the day-to-day operations of the courts. I am also aware that similar provisions exist elsewhere in the Criminal Code and instead require reasons to be stated on the record. This, too, is something I believe the justice committee will no doubt take into consideration and look at when it is studying the bill.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="45">(1145)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3351465">The bill also proposes to include similar conditions for section 810.1 of the Criminal Code, recognizing orders often referred to as peace bonds. These are imposed where it is reasonably feared that the defendant will commit one of the enumerated sexual offences against a child under the age of 16. The bill proposes to amend this provision to require the court to consider imposing a condition prohibiting any form of communication between the defendant and any individual named by the court, or prohibiting going to any specified place, unless the named individual consents or unless the court finds, as I mentioned, exceptional circumstances exist to permit such contact. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351466">I agree that the court must consider these types of conditions, and I look forward to this proposal being reviewed in more detail at the committee to ensure that the provision will function as the sponsor of the bill has intended.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351467">Finally, the bill would also provide the authority for imposing specific types of non-contact conditions under conditional release orders pursuant to the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, which includes parole orders, statutory release orders and orders for temporary absence from federal penitentiaries. Specifically, the bill proposes to amend section 133 of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act to require the Parole Board of Canada or other releasing authority to impose conditions that prohibit contact with a witness, victim or other specified person, or from going to specific places unless there is consent or there are exceptional circumstances for not doing so. For the same reasons I have already mentioned, I do support the proposal in Bill <Document DbId="6077022" Type="4">C-489</Document>. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351468">The sponsor of the bill, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170478" Type="2">Langley</Affiliation>, has explained why he introduced the bill, namely because the safety and well-being of victims in his riding were not being taken into consideration. Indeed, if it is happening in his riding, we know it is happening in other parts of the country. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351469">The victims were not being taken into consideration when decisions were being made regarding the release of offenders into his community. I agree that Bill <Document DbId="6077022" Type="4">C-489</Document> responds to these concerns and would help to enable victims, their families, witnesses and other individuals to feel safe in their homes and in their communities when these offenders are released back into the community.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351470">Moreover, the bill is consistent with our government's commitment to make Canada's streets and communities safer by holding violent criminals accountable and by increasing the efficiency of our justice system. It is also very consistent with our government's commitment to giving victims of crime a stronger voice, one that can be heard, listened to and given consideration in our criminal justice system.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351471">We support Bill <Document DbId="6077022" Type="4">C-489</Document>. I look forward to other members of the House supporting it. We can study it further in committee.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It is a privilege to speak on behalf of my constituents of <Affiliation DbId="170328" Type="2">Surrey North</Affiliation> about this important bill. As my hon. colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170299" Type="2">Gatineau</Affiliation>, has pointed out in a previous speech, it is rare that we as MPs have the opportunity to discuss something that has a tangible outcome for our constituents. It is a privilege to be able to bring a <Affiliation DbId="170328" Type="2">Surrey North</Affiliation> perspective to this debate.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351473">The NDP has a solid history of advocating for survivors of violent crimes, particularly in reference to gendered violence and violence against children.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351474">In my own riding, offenders who are released from detention have moved into neighbourhoods where constituents are worried for their safety and the safety of their families.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351475">My predecessor NDP MP, Penny Priddy, along with other MPs from British Columbia, previously proposed measures to assist municipalities in the management of violent offenders. They have called for federal funding for communities that must pay extraordinary costs to monitor these offenders, to support mental health facilities and addiction services, and to provide appropriate housing for the reintegration process. Lack of funding has not prevented hard-working professionals from addressing this concern. We have seen from the federal side, over the last number of years, a downloading of a number of services to the provinces and, eventually, to the municipalities. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351476">However, Surrey's crime reduction strategy has been heralded as the most comprehensive community-based initiative intended to reduce delinquency and re-offence. It builds community capacity to address crime while providing rehabilitation and reintegration assistance to the offenders.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351477">Surrey's program has been particularly successful because of the extensive collaboration between law enforcement and correction services, non-profit organizations, the Surrey school board, the Surrey Board of Trade and other community organizations. I am also grateful for the professionals who work in rehabilitation and half-way house services, and I encourage a perspective of rehabilitation and social integration in our justice system.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351478">The bill proposes restricting certain offenders from being within two kilometres of a house where a victim is present without a parent or a guardian, or from being in a vehicle with a person who is under the age of 16 years old without the presence of a parent or a guardian. It also would potentially prevent certain offenders from communicating with any victim, witness or any other person identified in a probation order, or from going anyplace specified in the order, except in accordance with specified conditions.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351479">This is an important bill for violent crime survivors' rights, and it must be examined with the needs of survivors in mind. Along with my NDP colleagues, I am in favour of Bill <Document DbId="6077022" Type="4">C-489</Document>, as we are in favour of any proposal that would protect vulnerable members of our society.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351480">Although well intentioned, the structure of the justice system often retraumatizes the very people it is trying to protect. It is well documented that witnesses and survivors, particularly of gendered crimes and cases involving children, are revictimized throughout the justice process, particularly when the victim must confront the alleged offender at trial.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351481">Once the ordeal is over, survivors can begin their healing journey. However, imagine a survivor's shock when the offender returns to the neighbourhood. The retraumatization of having to see this person every day could undoubtedly lead to increased mental health issues and challenges to the healing of the survivor.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351482">Although victims understand that offenders will eventually be released, it is imperative that they be informed of the release and the relocation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351483">Research has proven that knowledge about the offender and the rehabilitation of such can be incorporated into the psychological healing journey of the survivor. The knowledge that the offender is taking steps to address the reasons for his or her crime could be relieving to some survivors.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351484">Furthermore, information on the offender's relocation is essential to the development of a safety plan and a general feeling of security.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351485">However, as with any proposal that would affect Canadian lives, we need to ensure that the bill would offer suitable solutions.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3351486">The NDP proposes that there be extensive consultations with victim rights groups to ensure that Bill <Document DbId="6077022" Type="4">C-489</Document> offers adequate and appropriate protection for survivors of violence. I am particularly interested in gaining the perspective of organizations in my community, such as the Surrey Women's Centre, The Centre for Child Development and Options Community Services. By talking to these front-line service providers, families and local enforcement agencies, we can gauge whether the bill, in its current form, would address the needs of the most vulnerable.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351487">Throughout our discussions today, we need to be conscious of the fact that most crimes are unreported, particularly sexual assaults, and if they are reported, often survivor stories are not believed. Contrary to the “stranger danger” myth, the University of Toronto reports that in as many as 85% of sexual assault cases, the survivors know their attackers. As found by Calgary Communities Against Sexual Abuse, if children are the target of violence, in 75% of the cases they know the offender, who is usually a relative or family member.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351488">Power imbalance between the victim and offender and even the victim and justice services, as well as societal reception of certain crimes, often averts survivors from reporting. This means that many survivors are forced to relive their trauma without closure, justice and adequate support services. If the offender is a close relative, friend or community member, the survivor may be forced to continue to see the offender on a regular basis, reliving the trauma first experienced and making him or her increasingly vulnerable to further violence.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351489">Today we may not be able to change the lives of survivors of unreported crimes. However, through a debate in the House, we have the power to make a real change in the lives of those people who we can help. We need to do what we can here in the House to say that the retraumatization and revictimization of survivors of violence, particularly women, youth and children, is not okay. We need to protect survivors and empower them to continue their journey of healing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351490">I encourage my hon. colleagues in the House to reflect on these ideas while remaining conscious of the power we have in our positions as members of Parliament. We need to use this power to support survivors of violent crimes and continue to support tangible solutions for prevention, the justice system and protection of victims rights.</ParaText>

We in the NDP understand that steps have been taken for both victims and witnesses. We understand where he is coming from on this. We know he met with people in his riding who went to see him to explain what a real problem this is. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351496">As long as I have been a member of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, along with my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170299" Type="2">Gatineau</Affiliation>, we have seen a great deal of discussion and many bills on this matter. Quite frankly, having moved over to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights from the Standing Committee on Finance, we can understand much better and see the concrete impact this could have on victims.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351497">The NDP has always been in favour of victim protection and we still are, which is why we are supporting the bill. We want to study it at the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351498">Why do we want to study it? We are seeing more and more private members' bills being used to advance the government's agenda. We are not the only ones to say so. It is being widely reported in the media. Why is the government doing that? That is what we want to know and we think it is worth looking into the process. Again, this is not about taking away from or attacking the member for <Affiliation DbId="170478" Type="2">Langley</Affiliation>'s bill, but about how the process is being used.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351499">This bill addresses something rather important in that it would amend the Criminal Code and related legislation. In this case, we know that the Conservative government is being sued by Edgar Schmidt, who used to work at Justice Canada. He claims that the government was not obeying the law and not fulfilling its obligations to ensure that government bills are consistent with the charter.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351500">What is more, with the Conservatives, the cost of justice is at a record high because the government has to defend its bills in court. We are talking about $5 billion. That is quite a bit of money just to get the government to fulfill its legal obligations.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351501">Again, we want to know why a private members' bill is being used to introduce something that is already part of the government's law and order agenda.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351502">The <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> has really pushed this agenda. It is not necessarily the government doing this. It is backbenchers who are introducing these bills.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351503">To come back to Bill <Document DbId="6077022" Type="4">C-489</Document>, I want to say that it has good intentions in that it seeks to protect victims. The bill would ensure that a judge hearing a case is required to impose certain obligations. The judge would have to make an order prohibiting certain offenders from being within two kilometres of a dwelling house where the victim is present without a parent, say, the father. This is very important, as it was something that was raised by the Office of the Federal Ombudsman for Victims of Crime.</ParaText>

							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="10">(1210)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3351532">This motion goes against the Standing Orders and certainly the spirit of Parliament. The government is not allowed to break the rules of Parliament that protect the rights of the minority, the opposition and all members of the House of Commons who have to do their jobs for the people they represent. This motion is very clearly contrary to the existing Standing Orders.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351533">I have some good examples to illustrate this. In my opinion, there is no urgency that would justify the government's heavy-handed tactics to prevent members from holding a reasonable debate on its agenda. I say “agenda”, but for a long time now it has been difficult to pin down what this government's agenda is exactly. This is nothing new. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351534">The motion comes to us today at a difficult time, but just because the government held a brief caucus meeting and is facing numerous problems and a few scandals, it is not justified in violating the Standing Orders of the House of Commons. No one would accept those excuses. There is no historical basis for the government to use the Standing Orders in this way. That does not work.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3351535">There are a few important things we need to point out. One is that it behooves us to have some explanation of what this motion actually does. For those of us who do not intimately follow the rules and history of Parliament, it can be quite confusing not in terms of the intention of what the government has read but certainly in the implications. It needs some translation, not French to English or English to French, but translation as to what it actually means for the House of Commons. That is why we believe a point of order exists for this motion.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351536">The motion essentially would immediately begin something that would ordinarily begin in a couple of weeks, which is for the House to sit until midnight to review legislation. This is somewhat ironic from a government that has a bad history with respect to moving legislation correctly through the process and allowing us to do our work, which is what we are here to do on behalf of Canadians.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351537">I am not alone in seeing that the government has shown the intention of having some urgency with respect to 23 bills, 14 of which have not even been introduced since the last election. Suddenly there is great urgency, when in fact it is the government that has set the agenda. The urgency is so great that it has to fundamentally change the rules of how we conduct ourselves in this place in response to an urgency that did not exist until this moment. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351538">One has to question the need. Why the panic? Why now, and why over these pieces of legislation? Are they crucial to Canada's economic well-being? Is it to restore the social safety net that the government has brutalized over the last number of years? What is the panic and what is the urgency?</ParaText><ParaText id="3351539">Context sets everything in politics, and the context that the government exists under right now is quite telling. Every time I have had to stand in this place raising points of order and countering the closure and time allocation motions that the government uses, I am often stating and citing that this is a new low standard for Parliament. I have thought at times that there was not much more it could do to this place to further erode the confidence of Canadians or further erode the opportunity for members of Parliament to speak, yet it has again invented something new, and here we are today debating that motion.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351540">That is why we believe that Standing Order 13 needs to be called. It is because it is very clear that when a motion is moved that is contrary to the rules and privileges of Parliament—which is what I would underline, as it is the important part—the Speaker must involve himself or herself in the debate and ask that the debate no longer proceed.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351541">The privileges of members of Parliament are not the privileges that are being talked about by our friends down the hall to falsely claim money that did not exist or privileges of limo rides and trips around the world. The privileges of Parliament that speak constitutionally to the need for Parliament are that members of Parliament have the opportunity to scrutinized and debate government bills. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351542">Just before the riding week, we saw the government introduce another time allocation on a bill that had received exactly 60 minutes of debate. Somehow the Conservatives felt that had exhausted the conversation on a bill they had sat on for years, and suddenly the panic was on. We are seeing this pattern again and again with a government that is facing more scandal.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351543">I was looking through the news today. Every morning I start my day with the news and we consider what we should ask the government in question period. There are some days when the focus can be difficult and one may not be sure what the most important issue of the day is. However, the challenge for us today as the official opposition is that, as there are so many scandals on so many fronts, how do we address them all within the short time we have during question period or in debate on bills.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351544">I listened to my friend for <Affiliation DbId="170478" Type="2">Langley</Affiliation>, who has been somewhat in the news of late on his attempt to speak on issues he felt were important to his constituents. We saw him move a new private member's bill today. He withdrew the former bill, and now he is moving one again. The New Democrats will support the bill going to committee for study because we think there are some options and availability for us to look at the legislation and do our job.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351545">Whether it is muzzling of their own MPs and the Conservatives' attempt to muzzle all MPs in the House of Commons, or using private members' bills to avoid the scrutiny that is applied to government legislation, and one important piece of that scrutiny is the charter defence of the legislation and so, in a sense, the Conservatives are using the back door to get government legislation through and move their agenda in another way, or the omnibus legislation, which has received so much controversy in Canada as the government has increasingly abused the use of omnibus legislation, or the F-35 fiasco, or the recent Auditor General's report, or the former parliamentary budget officer who was under much abuse and the new Parliamentary Budget Officer who has asked for the same things he did, or infamously, prorogation, time and time again the pattern is the same. The government has complete disdain for the House.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351546">Whether it be the scandals in the Senate, or the China FIPA accord, or the recent problems with the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister's</Affiliation> former chief of staff, or the employment insurance scandals, or the $3 billion missing, or the 300,000 jobs that have not been replaced, the government keeps trying to avoid proper scrutiny out of embarrassment. However, the House of Commons exists for one thing and one thing alone, which is to hold the government to account. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351547">The government will make some claims that the urgency right now is because there has not been enough progress on legislation. Therefore, the Conservatives have to hit the panic button and would have the House sit until midnight, which has consequences beyond just being a late night, and I will get into those consequences in a moment because they support our notion that it infringes upon the entitlements of members of Parliament to debate legislation properly.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351548">The Conservatives' record shows, and this is not speculation or conspiracy, that when they ram legislation through, they more often than not get it wrong. That is not just expensive for the process of law making, but it is expensive for Canadians. These things often end up in court costing millions and millions of dollars and with victims of their own making. The scandal that exists in the Senate is absolutely one of their own making. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> can point the finger where he likes, but he appointed those senators.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351549">Specific to the point of order I am raising, this motion would lower the amount of scrutiny paid to legislation. It would allow the government extended sittings, which are coming in the second week of June anyway, as the Standing Orders currently exist, to allow the government to do that, but the Conservatives want to move the clock up and have more legislation rammed through the House. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351550">Also, as you would know, Mr. Speaker, the order of our day includes concurrence reports from committee, which allow the House to debate something that happened in committee which can sometimes be very critical, and many are moved from all sides. However, they would not get started until midnight under the Conservatives' new rules. Therefore, we would study and give scrutiny on what happened at committee from midnight until two or three o'clock in the morning. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351551">As well, emergency debates would not start until midnight. Just recently we had a debate, Mr. Speaker, that your office agreed to allow happen, which was quite important to those implicated. We were talking about peace and war and Canada's role in the world. It was a critical emergency debate that certainly went into the night. However, the idea is that we would take emergency debates that the Speaker's office and members of Parliament felt were important and start them at midnight and somehow they would be of the same quality as those started at seven o'clock in the evening. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351552">The scrutiny of legislation has become much less important than the government moving its agenda through, which is an infringement on our privilege as members of Parliament. The Conservatives' so-called urgency, their panic, is not a justification for overriding the privileges that members of Parliament hold dear. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3351553">As for progress, just recently we moved the nuclear terrorism bill through, Bill <Document DbId="5477296" Type="3">S-9</Document>. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351554">We also had much debate but an improvement on Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>, the military justice bill, to better serve our men and women in the forces. The original drafting was bad. The Conservatives wanted to force it forward and we resisted. My friend from St. John's worked hard and got an amendment through that would help those in the military who found themselves in front of a tribunal.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351555">We have the divorce in civil marriages act, which has been sitting and sitting. It would allow people in same-sex marriages to file for and seek divorce. All we have offered to the government is one vote and one speaker each. The government refuses to bring the bill forward and I suspect it is because it would require a vote. It is a shame when a government resists the idea that a vote would be a good thing for members of Parliament to declare their intentions on, certainly something as important as civil liberties and rights for gay men and women.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351556">I mentioned earlier why, in the infringement of this privilege, it causes great harm and distress not just to Parliament but to the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351557"> I asked my team to pull up the list of bills that were so badly written that they had to be either withdrawn or completely rewritten at committee and even in the Senate which, God knows, is a terrible strategy for any legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351558"> There was the infamous or famous Bill <Document DbId="5375610" Type="3">C-30</Document>, the Internet snooping bill, which the <Affiliation DbId="147112" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> said something to the effect that either people were with the government or they were with child pornographers, which may be an example of the worst framing in Canadian political history. There has probably been worse, but that was pretty bad. The Conservatives had to kill the bill. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351559">We have also seen Bill <Document DbId="5120829" Type="3">C-10</Document>, Bill <Document DbId="5383493" Type="3">C-31</Document>, Bill <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="5683261" Type="3">C-42</Document>, all of these bills were so badly written that oftentimes the government had to amend them after having voted for them. After saying they were perfect and ramming them through, invoking closure and shutting down debate, the Conservatives got to committee and heard from people who actually understood the issue and realized the law they had written would be illegal and would not work or fix the problem that was identified, and so they had to rewrite it. That is the point of Parliament. That is the point of the work we do.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351560">We have also seen bills that have been challenged at great expense before the courts. Former Bill <Document DbId="3076458" Type="3">C-2</Document>, the tackling violent crime act, with huge sections of the government's main anti-crime agenda, was challenged and defeated in court.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351561">Bill <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document>, arbitrarily eliminating backlog for skilled workers, was challenged and defeated.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351562">Bill <Document DbId="5093616" Type="3">C-7</Document>, Senate term limits, was after years just now deferred to the Supreme Court. It is called “kicking it down the road”.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351563">Also, there are Bill <Document DbId="5089903" Type="3">C-6</Document>, Bill <Document DbId="5442190" Type="3">C-33</Document> and others, and there are those that are being crafted and debated right now that are going to have serious problems.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351564">The essential thrust of our intention is in identifying the rules that govern us, and specifically Standing Order 13. The government has time and again talked about accountability before the Canadian people and talked about doing things better than its predecessors in the Liberal Party, the government that became so arrogant and so unaccountable to Canadians that the Conservatives threw it out of office. History repeats itself if one does not learn true lessons from history.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351565">As I mentioned, Standing Order 27(1) already exists, and it allows the government to do exactly what we are talking about, but not starting until the last 10 sitting days. The Conservatives have said that there is so much on their so-called agenda that they have to do this early, allowing for less scrutiny, allowing for emergency debates to start at midnight, allowing for concurrence debates that come from committees to start at midnight and go until two, three or four o'clock in the morning.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351566"> This is contrary to the work of parliamentarians. If the Conservatives are in such a rush, why do they not negotiate? Why do they not actually come to the table and do what parliamentarians have done throughout time, which is offer the to and fro of any proper negotiation between reasonable people?</ParaText><ParaText id="3351567"> We have moved legislation forward. My friend across the way was moving an important motion commemorating war heroes. We worked with that member and other members to ensure the bill, which came from the Senate, made it through speedy passage.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351568">Parliament can work if the Conservatives let it work, but it cannot work if they keep abusing it. Canadians continue to lose faith and trust in the vigour of our work and the ability to hold government to account. We see it time and again, and I am sure, Mr. Speaker, you have as well, in talking to constituents who say that they are not sure what goes on here anymore, that it just seems like government will not answer questions, that everyday they ask sincere and thoughtful questions and the Conservatives do not answer. Bills get shut down with motions of closure.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351569">Let us look at the current government's record.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351570"> Thirty-three times, the Conservatives have moved time allocation on legislation, an all-time high for any government in Canadian history. Through war and peace, through good and bad, no government has shut down debate in Parliaments more than the current one.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3351571">Ninety-nine point three per cent of all amendments moved by the opposition have been rejected by the government. Let us take a look at that stat for a moment. That suggests that virtually 100% of the time, the government has been perfectly right on the legislation it moves. All the testimony from witnesses and experts, comments from average Canadians, when moving amendments to the legislation before us, 99.3% of the time the government rejects it out of hand. It ends up in court. It ends up not doing what it was meant to do. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351572">Ten Conservative MPs have never spoken to legislation at all. I will note one in particular. The <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, who has not bothered to speak to his own bills, including the omnibus legislation, Bill <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="5754371" Type="3">C-45</Document>, which caused so much controversy. He did not bother to stand and justify his actions. I find it deplorable and it is not just me, Canadians as well, increasingly so. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351573">This is my final argument. We cannot allow this abuse to continue. This pattern has consequences, not just for what happens here today or tomorrow, but in the days, weeks, months and years to come and the Parliaments to come. If we keep allowing for and not standing up in opposition to bad ideas and draconian measures, we in a sense condone them. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351574">We say that Parliament should become less irrelevant. We think that is wrong. We think what the government is doing is fundamentally wrong. It is not right and left; it is right and wrong. When the government is wrong in its treatment and abuse of Canada's Parliament, that affects all Canadians, whatever their political persuasion. We built this place out of bricks and mortar to do one thing: to allow the voice of Canadians to be represented, to speak on behalf of those who did not have a voice and to hold the government of the day to account. Lord knows the government needs that more than anything. It needs a little adult supervision from time to time to take some of those suggestions and put a little, as we say, water in its wine. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351575">It has the majority. This is the irony of what the government is doing. In moving more time allocation than any government in history and shutting down debate more than any government in history and using what it is today, it speaks to weakness not strength. The Conservatives have the numbers to move legislation through if they saw fit, but they do not. They move legislation, they say it is an agenda and they hold up a raft of bills. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Peter Van Loan</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3351581">Mr. Speaker, I was surprised by this point of order, but I suppose I should not have been surprised that the NDP would pull out all the stops to try to avoid having to work hard in this House of Commons, to try to use every device it can think of and every procedure and every tactic it can think of to avoid having to work a little bit of overtime and stay here until midnight.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351582">I suppose if we were unionized around here, maybe we would not have to work extra hard or we would demand overtime for it. I suppose that is the attitude of the NDP, as it consistently represents those kinds of views around here.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351583">In terms of a point of order, what I heard was very thin and very lacking. First of all, on the substance of it, the entire complaint seemed to be an argument that there is insufficient debate and scrutiny of bills around here, and yet the argument is “let us not have more debate; let us have not as much opportunity for scrutiny; let us not work quite as hard up here; let us do a little bit less”. I fail to see how that is somehow a point of order.</ParaText>

That is how it has been practised for many years, decades—centuries one would say—in the Westminster parliamentary system. We are masters of our rules. We make them. That is what the green book says. That is the practice and procedure of this House.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351588"> That is what government motion no. 17 says. There is absolutely nothing that I heard from my friend opposite to the contrary.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351589">Further, at page 258, it says:</ParaText><ParaText id="3351590"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentRest="1" IndentFirst="2">In addition to the Standing Orders and provisional and sessional orders which form the collected body of written rules, the House may also adopt special orders.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>

I have gone through citation after citation of where they are specifically contemplated by the rules. Everything within government motion no. 17 complies fully with that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351615">What I found troubling about my friend's comments is that he did not have any citations to the contrary, rulings to the contrary or evidence to the contrary. In fact, he did not even have any arguments to the contrary other than arguments on the merits on the motion itself, which we are debating. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351616">Basically, what he got up and did, under the guise of pretending it was a point of order, was make a speech on the motion itself and its merits. It is his place to do so—after the government finishes presenting its arguments for it. The rules contemplate that. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351617">In fact, if there is a point of order to be raised or a privilege that has been offended, through this device, he has actually offended the privileges of other members of the House, the government and myself.

He has reversed the order, contemplated by our Standing Orders, in which a debate should proceed here.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351618">Mr. Speaker, you picked up the exact same thing and alluded to it in your remarks. I would not be the least bit surprised if you were to say to him, after I have my finished my comments on the main motion itself, that he has already discharged his right of reply and has in fact done so in a fashion that has offended my privileges, has prevented me from presenting my arguments, and presented his arguments himself, first, on the merits of the motion. That is highly improper. I find this an unusual and ironic situation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351619">The fact remains that he raised not a single citation, historical example or reason in the rules why this motion is not in order. However, every single thing we see in historical practice, in the citations I quoted and in the footnotes that point to earlier examples is that the House has the full right to consider a motion of this type, governing its rules and processes. It is decided by a majority vote. There shall be a debate on it in this fashion if the House wishes to have such a debate and people wish to speak to it. It even outlines the fashion in which that will happen.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351620">I am not personally hurt that he wanted to trump me and go first. I suppose it was a clever way of trying to do that and getting his message out. I am not offended that he did not speak to the merits of the motion, but rather wished to speak to the communications messaging of his party for the day. That is his right as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351621"> However, the fact is that, on a point of order, one has to look at the evidence and the rules that are in place, and decide it that way.

							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3351638">We agree and that is exactly what has happened here in the House of Commons.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351639">However, do not take my word for it; look at the facts. In this Parliament the government has introduced 76 pieces of legislation. Of those 76, 44 of them are law in one form or another. That makes for a total of 58% of the bills introduced into Parliament. Another 15 of these bills have been passed by either the House or the Senate, bringing the total to 77% of the bills that have been passed by one of the two Houses of Parliament. That is the record of a hard-working, orderly and productive Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351640">More than just passing bills, the work we are doing here is delivering real results for Canadians. However, there is still yet more work to be done before we return to our constituencies for the summer. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351641">During this time our government's top priority has been jobs, economic growth and long-term prosperity. Through two years and three budgets, we have passed initiatives that have helped to create more than 900,000 net new jobs since the global economic recession. We have achieved this record while also ensuring that Canada's debt burden is the lowest in the G7. We are taking real action to make sure the budget will be balanced by 2015. We have also followed through on numerous longstanding commitments to keep our streets and communities safe, to improve democratic representation in the House of Commons, to provide marketing freedom for western Canadian grain farmers and to eliminate once and for all the wasteful and inefficient long gun registry.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351642">Let me make clear what the motion would and would not do. There has been speculation recently, including from my friend opposite, about the government's objectives and motivations with respect to motion no. 17. As the joke goes: Mr. Freud, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. So it is with today's motion. There is only one intention motivating the government in proposing the motion: to work hard and deliver real results for Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351643">The motion would extend the hours the House sits from Monday through Thursday. Instead of finishing the day around 6:30 or 7 p.m., the House would sit instead until midnight.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3351644">This would amount to an additional 20 hours each week. Extended sitting hours is something that happens most years in June. Our government just wants to roll up our sleeves and work a little harder, earlier this year. The motion would allow certain votes to be deferred automatically until the end of question period, to allow for all honourable members' schedules to be a little more orderly.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3351645">As I said, all other rules would remain. For example, concurrence motions could be moved, debated and voted upon. Today's motion would simply allow committees to continue doing their work instead of returning to the House for motions to return to government business and the like. This process we are putting forward would ensure those committees could do their good work and be productive, while at the same time the House could proceed with its business. Concurrence motions could ultimately be dealt with, debated and voted upon.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351646">We are interested in working hard and being productive and doing so in an orderly fashion, and that is the extent of what the motion would do. I hope that the opposition parties would be willing to support this reasonable plan and let it come forward to a vote. I am sure members opposite would not be interested in going back to their constituents to say they voted against working a little overtime before the House rises for the summer, but the first indication from my friend opposite is that perhaps he is reluctant to do that. Members on this side of the House are willing to work extra hours to deliver real results for Canadians. </ParaText>

I hesitate to negotiate in public what we often try to spend our time at House leaders' meetings doing, as brief as that time sometimes is. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351665">Opposition members have consistently gone to the government with bills that we were interested in supporting, even in an effort to, as my friend says, work hard for Canadians, limit the amount of debate. A bill I mentioned earlier talks about the allowance of civil marriages, so-called gay marriages, a law that was passed by Parliament and opposed by the member's party, allowing for the closure of a loophole in the law to permit those who are married to also seek divorce, which seems a reasonable thing to do. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351666">All we have asked for, in the expediency of the passage of Bill <Document DbId="5387766" Type="3">C-32</Document>, is one vote, which takes about seven minutes, on average, in this place. We allowed the government to introduce a motion, if it saw fit, to allow one speaker per party. Doing the quick math on that, that would be about an hour and a half. We could see a bill that has been sitting for about 18 months, give or take, to pass completely in this place in an hour and a half, two hours at the outside if we did something slowly. The government has refused it every single time.</ParaText>

We just passed a technical amendments bill recently and there is an instruments bill that we are looking to pass as well. There has been progress, but what we have seen time and again is an attitude in breaking the historical—and he cannot answer this one, by the way, Mr. Speaker. A majority government, within two years, used time allocation to shut down debate, something Conservatives used to rile against when Liberals did it. The Conservatives have used that same tactic more than any other government in any four or five-year mandate in Canadian history.

We have said in the House in public many times that we are prepared to pass that bill if it is supported by the opposition at all three stages by unanimous consent. It could happen by unanimous consent in the House. Apparently, that is not good enough for the opposition members. As a result, that bill has not yet been passed because they simply have not accepted that offer.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351671">In terms of our overall legislative agenda, there is, as I indicated, a lot of work that needs to be done in the House that we are very pleased to do. One thing we have tried to do in the House is change the approach where time allocation is brought in as a form of shutting down debate, which used to be done in the past, to using it as a fashion to ensure a productive, hard-working approach. For example, on the second-last budget implementation bill, we provided for the longest debate ever in Canadian history on any budget implementation bill in that time allocation motion. This was to allow for full debate but also to allow for certainty that the measures would come into place. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351672">That has been our approach throughout: to give the members the fullest opportunity to participate, to allow a full opportunity for debate, but also to do it in a businesslike fashion where people know that we are going to debate it for a period of time, for a number of days, five, six, seven, whatever the case may be, on a particular bill, and then allow a matter to be voted on. That is why time allocation, of course, has been moved usually at the start of our debates and not toward the end, not after days and days, but, rather, in order to have certainty of scheduling. This is has been the approach of our government, one that is aimed at working hard and delivering results, being productive, hard-working, orderly, and doing the job that Canadians sent us to do by giving people a chance in the House to actually vote on measures before the House.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Usually members of Parliament get up and make a statement about their ridings about some issue that is important to them. My friend from Langley, who sits in the Conservative Party, was a parliamentary secretary, I remember, for the <Affiliation DbId="165138" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation>, a chair, a well-respected member of Parliament, and a friend. He sought to stand up and speak to something he thought was important to his constituents.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351696"> It was the old Conservative Party that shut down that member of Parliament and every other one who tried to get up and speak, because this new Conservative Party talks about wanting people to speak in the House and wanting to have debate. </ParaText>

That was to make Parliament more accountable and to reform the Senate.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351701">The current government has now been in power almost seven long years. Is that right?

If we win, that platform and those promises become our agenda. That is what we would seek to do in office. It is simple. One of his promises, one of his agendas, one of his reforms was on the Senate. When the Conservatives were in opposition, they would see those Liberal senators down there taking their money, not really representing anybody, going on trips and maybe even defrauding taxpayers. Who knows? The Reform movement came in and said it was wrong and anti-democratic.</ParaText>

Now this same Prime Minister claims victimhood and wonders how this happened. How did his chief of staff, who sits to his immediate left every day and knows his deepest, darkest secrets, whom he put in charge of major trade files and negotiations with other countries, cut a $90,000 cheque to a senator he appointed? However, obviously, the Prime Minister's hands are clean, and he has nothing to say about this. He believes that his hands are so clean that he is not going to answer any questions about it. He is going to go to South America to be in trade talks with countries we already have trade deals with.

							<ParaText id="3351722">Let us look at that for a moment. The way a bill is supposed to work is it comes into the House and gets debated. There is a pro and con and the real coming together or clash of ideas to improve the legislation because no one is perfect. The drafters of legislation do not get it right. They are sometimes hundreds of pages long and very complicated. The House is meant to debate that. Then we send it to committee and hear from experts, not just members of Parliament who are not often experts in these areas, but people who work in the field. They are the social workers, the financial experts, the crime experts and the police. We hear those suggestions and write amendments based on those ideas. That is the way this place is supposed to work.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351723"> However, the government is saying that in 99.3% of those cases those experts are wrong and the government is right. It will not change a period, a comma, not a word in any of the legislation. Then lo and behold, time and time again, the legislation is challenged in the courts successfully. The legislation does not fix the problems identified and costs Canada and Canadians billions. </ParaText>

The government decided in its vigour for its tough on crime agenda that it would pass a law that said that at any point, at any time, Canadians anywhere could have their BlackBerrys and iPhones tapped by the government, that web searches on home computers could be looked at by the government and the police. There is no country in the world, outside of Iran and North Korea, that would even consider doing this. The Conservative government thought it was a fantastic idea.

The government rammed it all into one bill and said that it was such important legislation it would shut down debate on it too. Then whole sections of the bill were taken out. Why? It was because they were unconstitutional. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351728">Now we know where that all comes from. Canadians actually pay for a service. Many members of Parliament may not know this, but when a government introduces a bill it goes to constitutional legal experts to determine if the new legislation goes against our constitution, our foundation as a country? If it does, it is a good idea to modify the law to ensure it does not get challenged in the courts, which costs upwards of $3 million to $5 million to taxpayers every time there is one of those challenges.

							<ParaText id="3351747">We have senators like Duffy, Wallin and Brazeau. All current senators have potentially stolen money from Canadians. These are the same senators that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> says are very good people. These are the same senators using money from the Canadian people to travel during an election and raise money for the Conservative Party. That is the new Conservative Party. I do not understand.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351748">I remember the Reform Party of Canada and some reforms that Mr. Manning wanted to make. With the current party, it is the same story as with the Liberal Party and the Gomery commission and all the rest. I am both angry and sad.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351749">The majority of Canadians did not vote for this government, which has a majority, but does not have the majority support of Canadians. Close to 60% of Canadians voted against this agenda, against this sort of arrogance. They voted not to have the kind of government that now uses brutal tactics, not against the New Democratic Party, but against Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351750">Lastly, I think we need to have a referendum, which may not happen until the next election.</ParaText>

He actually allowed the media into his caucus room for a second, which was bizarre. The bully turns into the victim, that somehow this is put upon them, that they are somehow being victimized here.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351753">What frustrates me is not just the work that we have to do as parliamentarians that is constantly thwarted by the government at committee stage, and my friend laughs, but how can it be possible that 99.3% of all amendments were rejected? The evidence is clear.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351754">My friend can shake his head and laugh and treat this with disdain or heckle out what seems to be a favourite tactic of some of my friends who cannot win the debate, but can simply sit in their seats and heckle, yell and try to put down a comment that hurts a little too much, that being that 99.3% of all amendments were rejected, that the witnesses were all wrong, that the government was always right and that the courts must be wrong too. Soon the Conservatives will call them activist courts like the Republicans do in the states. Members should watch for it because it is coming.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351755">We believe this motion is fundamentally flawed in its abuse of this place and of all members. I do not speak just for the New Democrats or the folks down the way. I speak for the backbenchers who have been rubbing up against some of the limitations. What is sad about most of it and is most concerning is those who are not agitating against the Conservative government's control over its backbench and accepting it. I lament the most for those who are so comfortable reading the script from the Prime Minister's Office and repeating it like robots, feeling that is their work and whose expectations of what it is to be a member of Parliament are so diminished that they simply accept it, not those the media have called rebels who have stood up and stated that they want to have their own statement but the Prime Minister's Office has shut them down. They run under the blue banner, which is their choice.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351756"> I lament for those who seem so happy to get up and repeat the mindless dribble that is put to them by the Prime Minister's Office day after day. When they first ran for office, I wonder if they said that they wanted to be a member of Parliament to represent people and get to Parliament to speak with a strong voice of conviction on behalf of the people they represent and that in order to do they would read whatever was put in front of them by the Prime Minister's Office, written by a 24-year-old intern who types out some sort of nonsense and makes up policies that the NDP does not have, making personal attacks on a regular basis as a substitute for honest and sincere debate? Was that really their expectation?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351757">I wish I had some video evidence from some of those early debates because I know that is not what those members ran on. I know their nomination meetings did not look like that, nor did any of the debates they attended during the campaign. That is not what they said. They said that they would speak on behalf of their constituents, fight for them and still raise their voice, even if that meant it was contrary to what their government suggested.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3351758">I am sure that is what my friends across the way said. They are very nice people. I know a lot of these folks, as we have spent some time together. I know some of their inner thoughts about the way Parliament ought to be, and some of them lament it. However, it is the ones who do not who worry me. They are the ones who so comfortably slip into that straitjacket day after day. Maybe they just get used to it, but they are able to rationalize that there is some larger agenda that is more important than their having an independent and free voice.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351759">They can keep yelling and you can allow them to if you wish, Mr. Speaker, but the truth often hurts, and the truth of the matter is that with a majority government, this member and his colleagues have chosen to vote for closure more than any government in Canadian history. With a majority, the Conservative government has refused the evidence, has refused the science time and time again, and that government is bad government. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351760">The Conservative government appointed senators, and I am sure some fundraising went on for some of my friends. Maybe Ms. Wallin, Mr. Duffy or Mr. Brazeau came by and raised a few dollars, shook a few hands and got a few votes for my friends. Maybe there is a little bit of a tarnish on my colleagues, which is why they are calling out and why they are worried. It is because their base hates this. They hate the idea of entitlement and of an insider's game that goes on in Ottawa all the time, and that friends of the Prime Minister's Office get some sort of special treatment. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351761">Talking about special treatment, how about a $90,000 personal cheque just cut off the back and handed over to somebody who may have defrauded taxpayers? Where is the Reform Party now? Where are the original Conservative intentions now? They are gone, bit by bit, eroded piece by piece. That is where it has gone, and it has all been subjugated to some idea that there is a better and bigger cause, that this grand scheme they are involved in somehow makes all of it justifiable. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351762">Can you imagine, Mr. Speaker, what these guys would sound like if the roles were reversed? If it were a Liberal government with senators getting cheques from the Prime Minister's chief of staff or a New Democratic government acting the way the Conservatives act, could you imagine the hue and cry and the calls for resignations every second minute? They would be losing their minds. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351763">Now the Conservatives play the victim, saying that these senators were put upon them, that they didn't know what they were doing, that it is terrible. They only have a majority, both here and there. The Prime Minister has appointed more senators than any Prime Minister in Canadian history. How many did he say he would appoint? None, but he had to appoint some, and then it had to be justified. These are small and slow slippages, and this motion is a continuation of that. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351764">This motion says that Parliament matters less and that those Canadians who have grown cynical about the role of MPs are justified in their cynicism. We say that is wrong. How do we turn to the young voters coming up? How do we turn to people who come to us and say that they might want to run for office one day? How can we say that their voices will matter when the government moves motions like this time and time again, shutting down debate?</ParaText><ParaText id="3351765">As my friend the <Affiliation DbId="191408" Type="4">Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development</Affiliation> said, the Conservatives do not want to shut down debate; they just want to control it. Is this is how one entices people into a life of politics? Is this how one encourages young people to vote? Do we say, “Welcome to Parliament, where we are going to control debate and shut it down time and time again”? This is the Conservatives' call to action. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351766">It is not a call to action, but a call to inaction. It is a call to cynicism. It is calling to people, “Do not look over here; nothing is happening here in government. Go on with your lives and other things that are more important and distracting.” The government is counting on people to have an attention deficit rather than realize that the decisions we make here in Parliament every day affect Canadians in every way. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351767">If members of Parliament cannot do their work, as this motion suggests, and hold the government to account, it is bad government. It is bad government when it cannot find $3 billion that may be under a mattress or in a banana stand or wherever it happens to be, and when senators rip off taxpayers with no consequence whatsoever. We think the RCMP might have a role to play here. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351768">What would happen if any of the Canadians in our gallery today or watching on TV defrauded the Canadian government of $500? They would get charged. However, if it is a Conservative senator, what happens? Oh, they just recuse themselves from caucus. Wow. They still get paid, they still have all of their privileges, but they cannot go to caucus meetings on Wednesday mornings. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351769">Mr. Speaker, do you think that maybe that punishment is a little severe? I mean, having to recuse oneself from a two-hour meeting on Wednesday morning for defrauding taxpayers—boy, that seems pretty harsh. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351770">Why the double standard? We used to call that the culture of entitlement. I remember a colleague of mine in this place, Ed Broadbent, asking a former Liberal minister who became head of the mint and was claiming packets of gum and coffee on his receipts, “Are you entitled to your entitlements, sir?” This person took a moment of authenticity and said, “Yes, I am entitled to my entitlements.”</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3351771">The Conservatives railed at the Liberal entitlement, the culture of entitlement, the Gomery inquiry and all those terrible things that went down. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351772">History repeats itself if one is not a student of history, and it seems that the Conservative Party has not looked at the history of this place or of other parliaments. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351773">The fact of the matter is that debate in and of itself is not a bad thing. The exchange of ideas is not in and of itself a bad thing. Being wrong from time to time is not of itself a bad thing; learning happens in those moments, and the government needs to learn, because I can read off the list of the bills it had so fundamentally wrong that it had to withdraw them. The Conservatives had to say that they got it so badly wrong because they listened to none of the amendments that they have to fix it now, at the very last minute, or wait until it gets to the Senate and let the unaccountable, unelected and under investigation senators deal with it. That is no form of democracy worth defending, and the Conservatives know it.

							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3351790">In raising this matter, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170592" Type="2">Toronto Centre</Affiliation> explained that during its consideration of Bill <Document DbId="5608832" Type="4">C-425</Document>, the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration adopted a motion recommending that the House grant the committee the power to expand the scope of the bill in order to allow for the consideration of what he called “amendments that the Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism has asked be added to the list”.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351791">This led to the presentation on April 23, 2013, of the committee's eighth report. He found this approach to be problematic in two respects. First, he argued that pursuant to Standing Order 97.1, committees examining private members' bills are restricted as to the types of reports they can present to the House. He argued essentially that since the eighth report falls outside these parameters, it is out of order. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351792">His second argument centred on the impact such a manner of proceeding could have. Specifically, he expressed concern that if committees examining private members' bills were to be allowed latitude to proceed in this fashion, the effect of this practice “will be that the government could, by extrapolation, even add an omnibus feature to a private member’s bill and say it is using its majority to add everything, the whole kitchen sink, into the measure.”</ParaText>

In making this observation, he pointed out that this process would result in a number of hours of debate in the House on the committee report before a decision was taken. </ParaText>

He further explained that the committee remains seized of Bill <Document DbId="5608832" Type="4">C-425</Document> and that its eighth report in no way supersedes the 60-sitting-day deadline to report the bill back to the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351795">At the outset the Chair wishes to clarify what appear to be certain misconceptions about the nature of private members' bills. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351796">The first of these has to do with the arguments made by the House leader for the official opposition and the member for <Affiliation DbId="170303" Type="2">Saint-Lambert</Affiliation> in reference to the constitutional compliance of legislation sponsored by private members.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351797">As pointed out by the member for <Affiliation DbId="170303" Type="2">Saint-Lambert</Affiliation>, constitutional compliance is among the criteria used by the Subcommittee on Private Members' Business to determine non-votability of private members' bills. <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, second edition, describes these criteria at page 1130, including one requirement that “bills and motions must not clearly violate the <I>Constitution Acts, 1867 to 1982</I>, including the <I>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</I>”.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351798">The Chair is not aware of further constitutional compliance tests that are applied to any kind of legislation, whether sponsored by the government or by private members, once bills are before the House or its committees. In addition, hon. members will recall that in a recent ruling delivered on March 27, I reminded the House that as Speaker I have no role in interpreting matters of a constitutional or legal nature.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3351799">Another apparent source of confusion has to do with the difference between private bills and public bills.

							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3351802">Thus both government and private members’ bills are subject to the same basic legislative process, namely introduction and first reading, second reading, committee stage, report stage and, finally, third reading. At the same time, the House has seen fit to devise specific procedures for dealing with public bills sponsored by the government and private members alike. </ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3351803">For example, Standing Order 73 allows the government to propose that a government bill be referred to committee before second reading after a five-hour debate. The purpose of this rule is to allow greater flexibility to members in committee by enabling them to propose amendments to alter the scope of the measure.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3351804">The procedures in place for dealing with private members’ bills are likewise many layered, and have evolved in response to particular situations faced by the House in the past. This is the case with the provision for a maximum of two hours of debate at second reading, which came about to allow the House to consider more items and thus to allow more private members to have their measures considered. Similarly, Standing Order 97.1 was originally brought in to ensure that private members’ bills referred to committee would be returned to the House and to the order of precedence in a timely fashion.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3351805">In the present case, it appears to the Chair that the essence of the procedural question before me is to determine whether the House has the power to grant permission to a committee to expand the scope of a private member's bill after that scope has been agreed to by the House at second reading and, if so, whether this can be achieved by way of a committee report.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351806"><I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, second edition, is helpful in this regard. It states at page 752:</ParaText><ParaText id="3351807"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Once a bill has been referred to a committee, the House may instruct the committee by way of a motion authorizing what would otherwise be beyond its powers, such as, for example, examining a portion of a bill and reporting it separately, examining certain items in particular, dividing a bill into more than one bill, consolidating two or more bills into a single bill, or expanding or narrowing the scope or application of a bill.</QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText><ParaText id="3351808">Clearly then, by way of a motion of instruction, the House can grant a committee the power to expand the scope of a bill, be it a government bill or a private member's bill. An example can be found at page 289 of the Journals for April 27, 2010, where an opposition member moved a motion of instruction related to a government bill.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3351809">Having established that the House does have the authority to grant permission to a committee to expand the scope of a bill through a motion of instruction, the question becomes whether a committee report is also a procedurally valid way to achieve the same result. </ParaText>

In that respect, Standing Order No. 97.1 continues to apply.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351811">However, Standing Order No. 108(1)(a) does grant committees this power under their more general mandate to:</ParaText><ParaText id="3351812"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">examine and enquire into all such matters as may be referred to them by the House [and] to report from time to time</QuotePara></Quote>

We have gone from having a minority Conservative government to a totally different attitude on how to govern proceedings inside the House now that the Conservatives have a majority. Democracy has really fallen to the side. It is not as important as it used to be when the Conservative/Reformers had a minority government.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351832">I want to raise a specific issue. It was during the 39th Parliament that the previous clerk of the House of Commons told the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs that the budget for Parliament can handle two weeks of extended sitting hours in June. However, if the extended hours were to continue for additional weeks, the government would likely have to seek Parliament's approval for more money.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351833">I notice that the supplementary estimates (A) do not include a request to make any of the payments that will be generated by things such as overtime for House of Commons staff. I would argue that the government House leader seems to be responding to a Conservative crisis from last week and is getting anxious to leave a little early as opposed to going through the normal process. If the government had a plan to sit extra hours, there should have been a budget request going into the estimates to increase the budget, which would allow us to sit the extra weeks.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351834">My question to the opposition House leader is whether he would concur that this might have been done in a very hasty fashion, possibly as a way to deal with the crisis that is looming with respect to the Senate.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The fact that they have not actually accounted for the money required to run Parliament for these extra hours for an extended time—a month, in this case—shows two things. One is that they do not really care all that much if they have to blow more money. I remind my hon. colleague of the scandal around the F-35 purchase. It does not really matter what kind of evidence comes forward or how expensive it is, whether the evidence is from the Parliamentary Budget Officer, the U.S. Congress or the Auditor General of Canada. The political expediency of buying those particular jets, which they seem obsessed with, always overrides the responsibility they have to taxpayers.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3351836">With respect to this new bullying tactic and ramming bills through Parliament and the fact that it is going to cost more money to do what the Conservatives say they are going to do, I am going to take the House leader at his word today. When he was asked by my friend from <Affiliation DbId="170299" Type="2">Gatineau</Affiliation> if we were sitting all the way to the end of June, as the calendar now states, at these extended hours, he said yes, because they are such hard-working Conservatives. </ParaText><ParaText id="3351837">They do not have the money to pay for it. We will find out where they claw it back from. I have an idea. There is $90 million being spent on the Senate, where we do not really get good value for money. Why do we not cut that budget down a few hundred million dollars over the years and pay for some things Canadians want?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We could start to look at the way the Conservative government spends its money, which is badly, on gazebos and F-35s. There is $3 billion it cannot actually account for, which I believe was meant for anti-terrorism measures, and $100-plus million for ads Canadians are annoyed by. Those all seem like good places to start to look for the money we need to allow Parliament to function. I think Canadians could actually get behind the idea of allowing democracy to go ahead of all of these wasteful, ridiculous expenditures of the Conservatives, who were supposed to be conservative with taxpayer dollars and have turned out to be anything but. Those would all be great sources.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351840">I would like to suggest to my friend down the way that the Senate would be the New Democrats' preferred place to start. Not only are we losing money in the proposition and getting nothing for it, we are probably being defrauded right now. I do not want to pay for Conservative senators to run around raising money for Conservative MPs and the party itself.

We are dealing with the Investment Canada Act. This is the third time it has been in a budget bill, because it has been done wrong every single time. There is legislation related to CIDA.

Every time the current government increases the hardship for the border guards who work at all the border crossings, but particularly at Windsor, he has recognized not only the harm and the risk to our border agents but the harm to our Canadian economy when we do not have the free flow and exchange of goods, particularly with our largest trading partner.</ParaText><ParaText id="3351845">With respect to how legislation comes through now, it has become a fundamental and categorical mess. Not only is there the expense to Canadians from all these charter challenges that go to the Supreme Court, while the government uses Canadians' money to defend bad legislation it knows is wrong, it also hurts the business community, which is looking for certainty of the rules, whether it is the foreign investment act, et cetera. It would be incredible if one of these ministers would get up one day and actually define “net benefit” when talking about the acquisition of Canadian companies from, in some cases, Chinese state-owned enterprises.

However, we also think there are some important areas in which the recommendations did not go far enough in addressing the crucial challenges that Canada faces.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352134">Let me begin with some general areas of concern that were raised in testimony by a number of witnesses who appeared before our committee.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352135">It is true that labour shortages were already being felt prior to the 2008-2009 recession, especially in the western provinces. The recession eased this pressure, but already shortages are reappearing in certain regions and sectors. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352136">Given the aging population, it is likely that labour and skills shortages will increase, but this will not be true for all regions nor for all occupational groups. While shortages may be less severe in occupations requiring fewer qualifications, low-skilled occupations are also experiencing shortages, especially in regions with strong and rapid economic growth.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352137">The first finding of the study, which was reiterated by many witnesses, is that no single solution will magically solve the challenges caused by labour and skills shortages. Various complementary solutions must be identified.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352138">One solution that was mentioned often by the witnesses who appeared as part of the study was to make all the essential information on future labour needs available so that educational programs can be created and modified accordingly, and so that consequently young people can choose occupations that will be in high demand. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352139">Obviously that will not be possible without high-quality labour market information. The holders of these data must work together to avoid duplication and find ways to improve both the quality of the information as well as the distribution of all LMI products to the people who can benefit the most from its use.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352140">Another solution the committee heard throughout the study was to maximize the untapped potential of individuals and certain groups of the Canadian population that have a lower participation rate or a higher unemployment rate than average, such as mature workers, people with disabilities, aboriginal peoples and recent immigrants. These groups represent a huge pool of untapped talents and could help address a significant part of the skills shortages.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352141">Other suggestions made by witnesses include increasing labour force mobility, increasing awareness of trades and professions in demand that are not popular with young people, providing workers with adequate on-the-job training, increasing the level of basic skills, improving worker productivity and increasing reliance on partnerships between various levels of government, companies, educational institutions, students and workers. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352142">Of course, special mention was made of the temporary foreign worker program, around which there was a significant consensus that there had to be reform. Given the recent media spotlight on the temporary foreign worker program, I do not think that will surprise any member in the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352143">The recommendations in the report address many of these concerns. In fact, there were 38 recommendations made by the committee, most of which my NDP colleagues and I agreed with. Let me re-emphasize the word “most”, because as one can imagine, on a Conservative-dominated committee, much of the language in this report is both self-congratulatory and slanted to the needs of employers only. Nonetheless, we did find some significant common ground.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352144">There were, however, also areas of significant disagreement, and I want to spend the better part of my remaining time on those areas. These areas represent a huge missed opportunity, and I would hope that moving forward, the government will take a second look at our minority report and use it to shape additional measures that were lacking in the original recommendations.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352145">Let me begin with comments about labour market information. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352146">Time and time again the committee heard from witnesses that labour market information in Canada is not good enough. We heard that the data are not granular enough and do not allow for sufficient breakdown by occupation or region. The data are also not published frequently enough and do not allow for high-quality projections of shortages in the future. In fact, the committee's final report offers numerous instances in which the testimony from industries and the data available from current surveys disagree on whether or not there is or will be a skills or labour shortage in a given industry.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="05">(1505)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3352147">The Certified General Accountants Association recently published an examination of available sources of data that concluded that our current LMI is not good enough to enable policy-makers to effectively deal with labour shortages. It recommends “...closing the statistical information gap and improving the relevance and reliability of labour market statistics at the regional and occupational levels”.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352148">Given that good LMI is the linchpin to good skills training and labour force development policy as well as crucial to good immigration policy and management of the temporary foreign worker program, we find the report's recommendation on LMI to be very weak indeed. We need more than better publicity for the data that are already being produced. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352149">The experts on the advisory panel on labour market information established by the Forum of Labour Market Ministers have already provided an excellent blueprint of the steps that could be taken to improve the collection, analysis and use of LMI in Canada. For that reason, my NDP colleagues and I recommended that the government take steps to implement the recommendations made in the final report of the advisory panel on labour market information.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352150">We also noted in our report that the weakness of our labour market information has been exacerbated by cuts to Statistics Canada and its surveys and by the elimination of core funding for sector councils, which play a crucial role in bringing together industry partners and provide very useful sector-specific LMI. Therefore, we also recommended that Statistics Canada be provided with the funding it needs to improve labour force-related surveys and that core funding be restored to sector councils. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352151">Moving on to a second area that merited additional attention, I want to focus next on the need to develop the Canadian labour force. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352152">While employers are experiencing shortages of both skilled and low-skilled labour, unemployment in Canada remains high, with six unemployed Canadians for every job vacancy. The Conservatives' response has been to blame the unemployed for their unemployment, to reduce access to employment insurance while trying to force Canadians to move to other parts of the country and to use the temporary foreign worker program to drive down wages.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352153">By contrast, New Democrats believe that Canadian workers and employers benefit when Canadians are given the tools they need to be able to take available jobs. That is why we believe that investments in skills training are so important. We laud the report's recommendation that the government consider incentives to employers to invest in on-the-job training. However, we also recommend that the government review its bilateral agreements with the provinces to ensure that they provide maximum benefit to Canadians in need of training. For instance, the fact that the largest part of funding for skills training provided through labour market development agreements is limited to those who qualify for employment insurance benefits makes no sense when more than 6 in 10 unemployed Canadians are not qualifying for EI.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352154">Similarly, we believe that Canadians need support for labour mobility rather than to be threatened with the loss of their EI benefits if they do not move for the jobs. We are pleased that the report recommends support for a tax credit for travel and lodging for those working more than 80 kilometres away from their residence. This is a proposal I have been pushing for years by introducing Bill <Document DbId="5079447" Type="4">C-201</Document>, an act to amend the Income Tax Act for travel and accommodation deduction for tradespersons. The building and construction trades have been lobbying for this bill for over 30 years, and it continues to be one of the key priorities at each and every one of their legislative conferences. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352155">In every Parliament the government has made vague promises of progress to come; then each Parliament ends without concrete action. The time to rectify that situation is now, and I appreciate the committee's support in this regard. The ask is simple: allow tradespersons and apprentices to deduct travel and accommodation expenses from their taxable income so that they can secure and maintain employment at a construction site that is more than 80 kilometres away from their home. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352156">At a time when some regions of the country suffer from high unemployment while others suffer from temporary skilled labour shortages, the bill offers a solution to both. Best of all, it is revenue neutral for the government because the cost associated with the income tax cut is more than made up by the savings in employment insurance. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352157">Now that the Conservatives have a majority in the House of Commons, there are no more excuses. The government can and must support the bill and act unequivocally to support Canada's building and construction trades. I am hoping to be able to test the government's resolve on this issue in the very near future.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352158">Let me just give a quick shout out to some of the people from my hometown of Hamilton who have been instrumental in putting this issue on Parliament's agenda. In particular, I am thinking of Joe Beattie, Tim Penfold, Geoff Roman, Gary Elleker, Dave MacMaster, Paul Leger and all the members of the Hamilton-Brantford Ontario Building and Construction Trades Council, whose support for the bill has been unwavering and who, frankly, were the first to bring the issue to my attention. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="10">(1510)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3352159">I could talk about my bill and the need for its speedy adoption all day. Nonetheless, I recognize that my time here is limited and I also want to get some other issues on the record with respect to the current skills shortage.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352160">One of the other barriers to labour mobility that was raised over and over again was the lack of affordable housing. Regions that are experiencing an economic boom cannot develop housing fast enough to offer workers reasonable accommodation at prices they can afford. Therefore, in our minority report we recommended that the government support NDP Bill <Document DbId="5353445" Type="4">C-400</Document>, which called on the government to create a national affordable housing strategy in co-operation with the provinces and territories.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352161">Members will know that in the time since we tabled our report, the Conservatives defeated that bill in this House. To New Democrats and housing activists from coast to coast to coast, that was a devastating rejection of a desperately needed program. Canada remains the only G8 country without a housing strategy, while 1.5 million families and individuals are unable to access adequate, affordable housing. It is a national disgrace. Certainly the evidence we heard at committee confirmed that the lack of affordable housing should have been a priority for our federal government.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352162">Similarly, testimony confirmed that the Conservatives also mismanaged the temporary foreign worker program, allowing employers to bring in temporary foreign workers with little to no monitoring for compliance with the rules of the program. The result has been that Canadian workers have lost out on jobs that should have been available to them, while temporary foreign workers face exploitation and rights violations. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352163">If managed properly, the temporary foreign worker program should provide a temporary solution to a serious problem while emphasizing a longer-term response that promotes the best interests of Canadian workers and employers and our economy. The government has announced a review of the temporary foreign worker program, and New Democrats recommend that this review be conducted in a thorough and transparent manner, with a report tabled in the House of Commons as soon as the review is concluded.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352164">Although this is another topic about which I could talk for hours, I will keep moving along.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352165">Let us look next at the need for effective partnerships. In its skills strategy, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development suggests that all relevant stakeholders must be involved in order to ensure an effective, comprehensive approach to skills policies. Designing effective skills policies requires more than coordinating different sectors of public administration and aligning different levels of government: a broad range of non-governmental actors, including employers, professional and industry associations, chambers of commerce, sector councils, trade unions, education and training institutions and individuals must all be involved.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352166">New Democrats agree that policies are stronger when all relevant stakeholders are involved and consulted, and that is why we recommend that the development of policy options to improve labour market information to ensure a better match between the skills of graduates and the needs of employers and to develop strong curricula must always include all relevant stakeholders: federal, provincial, territorial and aboriginal governments, businesses and industry, employee representatives and labour unions, educational institutions and student associations as well as not-for-profit groups.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352167">Speaking of students, my NDP colleagues and I respect that one of the major goals of post-secondary education is skills training. However, we also recognize that this is not the only goal for Canada's colleges and universities and that there is a role for pure research.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352168">We also respect academic freedoms and the rights of scholars to freely choose their subject areas and research projects. Therefore, we recommend that consultations on curricula always be undertaken with appropriate respect for the multiple roles of post-secondary educational institutions.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352169">Finally, I would be remiss if I did not say a few words about the participation of aboriginal peoples in the labour market. Our committee heard some very compelling testimony in that regard. As the report notes, aboriginal peoples' labour market outcomes must be improved to ensure that aboriginal peoples benefit from resource development to reduce aboriginal poverty and to provide the skilled labour force that Canada will need in the future.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352170">A key element of aboriginal labour market outcomes is education, yet the report offers no recommendations on aboriginal education at all. If educational outcomes are to improve for aboriginal students, they need adequately funded education that respects their unique culture and history in safe and healthy school facilities.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352171">First nations education is the jurisdiction of the federal government, which does not provide equitable funding for first nations children.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="15">(1515)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3352172">While budget 2012 provided some new funds for first nations education, only eight new schools were built out of 170 needed, and so far, no money has been committed directly to first nations schools for front-line education services. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352173">According to the Assembly of First Nations, $500 million is needed to bring funding for first nations K-12 education to parity with non-aboriginal Canadians. The AFN has also noted that a gap in funding for post-secondary education has prevented more than 13,000 first nations students from pursuing higher education. Those realities are completely unacceptable. That is why my NDP colleagues and I recommended that the government provide sufficient and equitable funding for first nations K-12 education as well as post-secondary education, including vocational training and apprenticeships, and that the government remove the punitive 2% cap on funding increases to first nations.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352174">The Conservatives' failure to take consultations seriously has already derailed this process once, with the chiefs withdrawing from the process due to inadequate consultation. That is why we further recommended that the government recognize first nations' jurisdiction over education and abide by the federal government's duty to consult by holding extensive and meaningful consultations leading to the creation of a first nations education act that respects first nations' rights, culture and history.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352175">The federal government also provides funding for Inuit education through territorial transfers and land claims agreements. The education system is seriously failing Inuit youth, with only 25% graduating from high school. Those who do manage to graduate are still not at the same skill level as non-aboriginal students.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352176">The report of Thomas Berger, a conciliator appointed to resolve differences in the negotiations for the implementation of the land claims agreement, found that education was a key factor in impeding progress on Inuit representation in the public service. It called for an increase of $20 million annually to education funding beyond what is provided through territorial financing. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352177">The same holds true for other jobs. Inuit youth need culturally and linguistically appropriate education that enables them to stay in school and graduate with the skills they need to join the workforce. New Democrats therefore recommended that the government increase funding for Inuit education beyond the funding provided through territorial financing and land claims agreements.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352178">Finally, the committee heard from multiple witnesses that the aboriginal skills and employment training strategy, ASETS, has been very successful in providing the training aboriginal Canadians need and the links with employers that help them find jobs after their training. However, the committee also heard that funding has been frozen since 1996, despite the fact that the need is greater than ever as the aboriginal population grows. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352179">ASETS holders have also noted the heavy reporting burden that comes with their funding. A review of the program is beginning, and New Democrats recommend that the federal government include ASETS holders in the ongoing program review in a meaningful way and work with them to establish a process for stable, predictable and adequate funding to maintain and improve this highly successful program.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352180">Let me try to sum up. To meet our labour force goals, we need more and better labour market data; incentives and/or requirements for employers to offer training programs; more support for workers seeking training; better EI programs; more affordable education programs; enhanced support for labour mobility; the ability of immigrants here to have their credentials recognized and a much faster and more efficient process; and better support for an immigration program that does more than simply provide cheap foreign labour with no path to citizenship.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352181">Overall, we need to see the skills shortage as one important issue among a series of important labour market issues, the most important of which remains the still very high unemployment rate. With 1.4 million Canadians out of work, it is hard to make the argument that we have a national labour shortage. What we have are regional shortages that cannot overshadow the fact that the Conservative government's most lasting failure is to develop and implement a strategy to create Canadian jobs. Until that happens, at best we will be tinkering at the margins.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

What the member wants is that I suggest that in some areas of the country there are skills shortages of such a nature that we absolutely have to bring in temporary foreign workers and that we have to be able to get access to cheap labour. Frankly, that is a recommendation with which I cannot agree, because until we actually provide decent wages for jobs and provide Canadians with the kind of skills training that enables them to fill the jobs in the areas where there are shortages, and until we provide incentives for labour mobility, temporary foreign workers should be the very last resort.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352191">As members know, from following the debates in this House, is that whether at HD Mining or at RBC, what is happening now is that temporary foreign workers are coming into this country and are displacing Canadians and Canadian jobs. That is completely unacceptable, so we are calling on the government to help Canadians access those jobs. Again, it would do that by offering decent wages, by investing in a comprehensive skills training program and by supporting labour mobility initiatives, such as my Bill <Document DbId="5079447" Type="4">C-201</Document>, which I am very hopeful will come to the House soon.

I do not think there is a more eloquent spokesperson in this country for the need to not only protect the existing EI system but to actually expand it so that those people who have paid into EI all of their working lives can access the benefits when they need them most.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352196">As members know, EI is supposed to be a rainy day fund. People are paying into it as an insurance system, and on the day they lose their jobs, they are supposed to have access to those benefits to tide them over and give them the ability to look for their next job.

Today's young Canadians belong to one of the most educated generations we have ever had in this country, yet they graduate and are unable to find employment. Why is that?

We also even heard about some of that this morning in committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352212">Since 2006, the government's top priority has been jobs, growth and long-term prosperity. We have good reason to be proud of our performance in this area. The numbers speak for themselves.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352213">Since the worst downturn of the recession, over 900,000 net new jobs have been created, mostly private sector and full time. In fact 90% of them have been in the private sector and full time, with over two-thirds in high-wage industries.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352214">Canada's economy has done well, but it still can do better. There are currently thousands of jobs available across the country that continue to go unfilled and too many Canadians are still looking for work. This has serious consequences for our country's economy and for Canadians' standard of living.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352215">For example, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in its top 10 barriers to competitiveness has once again identified skill shortages. As opposed to what the opposition likes to say, skill shortages is one of the number one obstacles to success of its members. Meanwhile we have segments of the population that are unemployed or underemployed and that would be available to fill those jobs.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352216">Something is wrong when we have so many Canadians sitting on the sidelines, looking for ways to enter the job market at a time when employers say that they have unfilled positions. Demand is particularly great for career fields, like science, technology, engineering, mathematics and many of the skilled trades, which require exactly those same skills in math and sciences. These shortages will only become more acute over the coming years as we see more and more baby boomers retire.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352217"> Canada's economic action plan 2013 has a three-point plan to ensure that skills training is aligned with the needs of the job market, something that the opposition members state they are voting against.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352218">First, we are introducing the Canada jobs grant to get employers directly involved in skills training decisions so they know exactly where there is a job so we can skill someone for that job, something I heard about from employers and employees all across the country last week when I was running round table consultations.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352219">Second, the plan will create more opportunities for apprentices, something we have heard about at our committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352220">Finally, it will provide support to groups that are under-represented in the job market.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352221">Let me focus a little more on the range of measures we have announced in economic action plan 2013.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352222"> Given Canada's demographic trends and especially our aging population, skills and labour shortages will only get worse until we find a way to use the country's untapped talent. I am talking about capitalizing on the potential of groups that tend to have the highest rates of unemployment, such as Canada's young people and individuals with disabilities.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352223">Many young people are graduating into unemployment or underemployment and that is because of a lack of skills that employers are actually seeking. There is a mismatch. Young people start to make career and education decisions as early as grade seven. By the time they finish high school, they have already formed their ideas of what is or is not actually the career for themselves. We need to help them get better information at an earlier age.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352224">We need to help them understand where the jobs really are in Canada and where they are not, something we spoke about during the course of this committee's discussion on this exact report. These echo what the committee heard from those who were interviewed.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352225">We know on-the-job experience is just as important as training and our apprenticeship programs are working well.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352226">However, there is room for improvement, particularly when it comes to better credential recognition. That is why we are working to put forward, with our province and territorial partners, an ability to harmonize requirements for apprentices.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352227">We are also going to examine the use of practical tests for methods of assessment. We will promote the use of apprentices in federal contract work, for things such as construction and maintenance of affordable housing and infrastructure projects, something that was specifically asked of us at committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352228">Economic action plan 2013 will invest significant funds over two years to give Canadians access to better labour market information, exactly what I was mentioning before, providing young people in particular the opportunity to know what is available and where and where it is not and develop new outreach efforts to promote careers in high-demand fields, where jobs are available for them to fill.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352229">For example, our young people need to become better informed about career opportunities in the skilled trades and how good wages actually exist. Having grown up in Fort McMurray, Alberta, I know that many of the individuals there, who are skilled trades individuals, have an acute idea of exactly what a good wage is and they are doing particularly well, whether that is working for a large firm or a small firm or moving on to create their own firm as an entrepreneur.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="35">(1535)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3352230">Skilled trades are an excellent opportunity for young people and it is not just apprentices who would benefit from this budget. There is another 5,000 paid internships that will be made available over three years for recent post-secondary graduates, ensuring they have on-the-job training that not only employers but employees have talked to us about so they can make the transition into the workplace.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352231">Our economy needs the skills, talents and amazing spirit of our young people, but we also need the skills, talents and amazing spirit of Canadians with disabilities. Any vision of future growth and prosperity in Canada would be incomplete without considering the contribution that people with disabilities can make. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352232">I would like to remind the House that economic action plan 2012 announced the creation of the Panel on Labour Market Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities. Its mandate was to identify private-sector successes and best practices and increasing the labour market participation of persons with disabilities. In its January 2013 report entitled, “Rethinking Disabilities in the Private Sector”, the panel estimates roughly 800,000 working-age Canadians who have a disability are unemployed. Imagine how they could help address the skills shortages that employers have across the country. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352233">The panel argues that there is a good business case for hiring individuals with disabilities and the report sets out practical steps that can be taken to recruit individuals with disabilities and support them in the workplace. The panel found that many workplace accommodations required for employees with disabilities cost little to nothing and organizations that already employed persons with disabilities reported they have significant benefits, both in terms of company culture and their bottom line. From personal experience, working in clinics and talking to the parents of young adolescents who have cerebral palsy or talking with patients who have disabilities, these are exactly the things we need to be doing moving forward.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352234">Our government is doing its part to get more people with disabilities into the workforce. Budget 2013 announced significant investments for a new generation of labour market agreements for persons with disabilities. The reformed agreements to be introduced in 2014 would better meet the needs of Canadian businesses and improve the employment prospects for individuals with disabilities.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352235"> Budget 2013 also proposes ongoing funding for the opportunities fund to provide more demand-driven training solutions for persons with disabilities. Budget 2013 would make permanent the annual funding for the enabling accessibility fund to support capital costs of construction and renovations to improve physical accessibility.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352236">Economic action plan 2013 also proposed the creation of a Canadian employers disability forum to be managed by employers for employers. This forum will facilitate education training, the sharing of resources and best practices with regard to the employment of individuals with disabilities, something that I would encourage all members of the House to inform their businesses about and to become active in.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352237"> When I was British Columbia last Friday, a number of employers stated they had not necessarily heard what the great results were of this report. I encourage as many business leaders as possible across the country to look up this report and read the recommendations. If they have questions, they should approach individuals who can give them some direction on education and what we can do in order to aid individuals with disabilities entering into the workforce.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352238"> The budget provides enhanced funding for the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, some of which will support research on labour market participation of Canadians with disabilities entering into the workforce.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352239">Lastly, I will comment on the cross-country consultations that the Government of Canada is doing with respect to the Canada jobs grant and temporary foreign workers. Having been in Regina, Calgary and Vancouver last week and later this week in St. John's and Halifax and other places in the country in the near future, we are listening to Canadians because we need their input and are asking for their input on how to ensure these are the most effective programs and skills training programs for Canadian businesses, employers and employees. We want to ensure we are linking Canadians to available jobs, those that are in demand, and that they have the information available to them so they can make great decisions with respect to their future career opportunities.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352240">I appreciate the time to speak to this concurrence motion. The skills and training initiatives in economic action plan 2013 will enable more Canadians to contribute to the economy and share in our growth and prosperity across the country. Therefore, we are happy to concur with the report from the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

In fact, there has probably been more effort by the Conservative government than any other government prior in promoting itself.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352249">In the local ridings, we spend roughly $300,000 on the summer employment program. These summer employment programs go a long way in not only filling jobs while students attend university, but also in developing the skill sets they have so they can actually get into full-time jobs after they graduate.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352250">Would the member try to justify to Canadians how her government feels it necessary to limit the amount of real summer employment for youth, while at the same time spending literally tens of thousands, $90,000 plus, on one ad during the NHL playoffs.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The member opposite may not have heard that.

I want to thank my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170199" Type="2">Hamilton Mountain</Affiliation> for bringing this forward at this time this afternoon to speak to this very important issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352264"> Before we get into the meat of the issue, I will just take two minutes up front here and maybe vent a little frustration that is on the minds of many Canadians currently, especially those who follow the NHL playoffs. It sort of ties in with the whole thing about job creation and what the government is doing, but also what it is not doing with regard to job creation and opportunities to fill some of the skills shortages that are in this country. It is neglecting some of the areas where we are seeing mass out-migration and hurting rural and remote communities.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352265"> The one that really has Canadians rankled is that the Conservatives continue to waste money. They did it every night of the NHL playoffs, and of course during the Juno Awards and the Super Bowl, with the action plan advertisements. We know that it costs $32,000 a minute for these particular ads. We know the number of summer students that could support, that every time we see an ad that is 32 summer students who could probably be supported through this money. Often, these are young people's first opportunities to get into the workforce, to garner and develop those work skills and those good work habits. Then they could go further and continue their education and become strong and productive citizens. That is what we all want here. However, there is this perverse attempt by the Conservatives to paint themselves as a caring party when we know that they are squandering important, precious money on these particular advertising programs.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352266"> The latest one is the job grants. If it was not bad enough before with the action plan ads, in the job grants ads the Conservatives are actually advertising for a program that is not even set up yet. They have not spoken to the provinces yet. It is supposed to be coming in 2015 and they have not even had consultations with the provinces and they are advertising this program. It is unbelievable. It would be like me going to my wife and saying, “Honey, if you want to congratulate me now I just finished the Cabot Trail relay road race. I haven't bought my pair of runners yet, I haven't gone for a jog in six years but I'm going to finish it next year and this is my advertisement here.” It is unbelievable.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352267">That money that the Conservatives are wasting is on a program that might or might not happen, and they have bailed out of training. Let us pick a number, say $200 million, that would have gone to the Province of New Brunswick to help with training in the labour market development agreement. Now the Conservatives are saying that they will come in with a third of the dollars if New Brunswick will come in with a third, and then the private sector will come in with a third. So if the Province of New Brunswick, which is running a significant deficit under its Conservative provincial government, cannot afford to match that $200 million, we know those federal dollars will not be going into those training opportunities for the young people in New Brunswick for them to pursue an education or apprenticeship and develop some kind of skill to be productive citizens. However, now they have the advertising. Therefore, I am with the lion's share of Canadians who are really upset with this thing.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="50">(1550)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3352268">There is a proviso at the bottom that this is subject to parliamentary approval. It has more disclaimers than a Viagra commercial. My suggestion is that they pull out of this program.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352269">That is enough ranting about the waste we are seeing. I want to talk about support for apprentices and where the Conservatives have fallen short. Regarding the inaction, suggestions have come forward. Testimony has been presented by very credible witnesses, people who are impacted by the changes the government has made over the last number of months. For example, on the apprenticeship program we had testimony just recently from Polytechnics Canada. Witnesses pointed out during committee meetings that the level of financial support provided through the system is just simply inadequate.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352270">We asked a number of apprentices about their level of support because if people take a trade, when they go to school they are supported by employment insurance. They talked about the attrition rate for young apprentices. People are older when they start apprenticeship programs. Maybe they take a job and get some life experience and then move to the trades when they are about 27 or 28 years old, on average. By that time, some may have a family. Certainly they have bills, if they are coming out of the workforce and are trying to upgrade into a trade. That is a reality. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352271">When they go to school, typically they make application for employment insurance and there is a two-week waiting period. Because the Conservative government has gutted EI processing centres, cut 600 jobs in the EI processing centres, the backlog of EI claims now just goes on and on. In 2004, 80% of the time first-time claims were being turned around in 21 days. At that time we thought that was a long time for a person to go without any household income. Now, and what we heard from witnesses, that is taking 28 days. That is the new target. Conservatives have extended the target, so they have a better chance of hitting the target if they make the target a little broader, but they are only hitting that 30% of the time.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352272">We are seeing young apprentices having to go five, six or seven weeks without any income. If they do not have family support, if they do not have someone helping them out by putting food in the fridge and paying their bills, then they are dropping out of the courses and are letting the apprenticeships go. We have testimony to that effect. There is no sign of that in the report. We are not seeing the testimony line up with the recommendations as presented.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352273"> The government heralds how well it is doing with apprenticeship grants. Through the department's own findings in 2009, it published in the apprenticeship grant review that almost all apprentices who completed their apprenticeship would have done so without the grants. I question what impact this is having on skills development and addressing the problem of skills shortages. There are many other initiatives. Certainly we have put those initiatives forward in the minority report. I would hope that the government would seriously consider and try to move on these.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Lamoureux" id="8023265"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170750" Type="2">Mr. Kevin Lamoureux (Winnipeg North, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3352288">Mr. Speaker, perhaps I could pick up on my colleague's comments about the lack of a plan. There is a significant difference between this particular government and the Liberal Party. The government has demonstrated a willingness to act, to a certain degree, but in a very piecemeal way. It will take on a little section and then talk about how much it is investing and how it will be to the betterment of Canadians. What we really need to do is take a holistic approach dealing with our skills and the types of employment opportunities out there. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352289">What we have witnessed with the government are serious cutbacks and neglect in dealing with the skills shortages Canada has, not only for today, but also for tomorrow. We need a government—ideally a Liberal government, I would suggest—that is going to take a more holistic approach to dealing with what is a very serious issue that all Canadians are trying to better appreciate. They want to see a government being more aggressive in dealing with the skills shortage and labour needs going forward. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352290">Canadians are concerned about unemployment. It is very real. Look at our youth unemployment numbers. They are some of the highest we have ever seen. The government is actually seeing net decreases in youth employment opportunities going forward. Of course we are going to be concerned about that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352291">What about the middle class, the individual who is 45 to 55 years of age, who now finds himself unemployed? Maybe he was working in the manufacturing industry in Ontario or Manitoba or any other place in Canada. He was receiving a relatively decent wage and now finds himself unemployed because of the structuring that is taking place worldwide and the impact, in part, it has had on Canada. Where is that caring, compassionate government that is going to stand up for the middle class, the working class, someone who has been deemed unemployed because of a factory having been shut down? The government has not ponied up. It has not been at the table. We do not see a government working with the many different stakeholders in our community. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352292">My colleague made reference to the jobs grant. The government is spending taxpayers' dollars on promoting the jobs grant, yet it has not done its homework on it. It has not had the necessary meetings with the many different stakeholders to try to develop a program that will be effective. This is something in which the government has been very much lacking. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352293">It was not that long ago that I was standing up and using the example of youth and summer employment job opportunities. We are seeing fewer youth being employed today than we have seen under previous administrations. Quite often it is those summer jobs that provide the skills and opportunities that assist young people upon completion of their post-secondary education in landing their first job. Instead, we have seen the government cut back on that. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352294">At the same time, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and the government have spent astronomical amounts of tax dollars. They are using tax dollars to promote things like the action plan, which many, including me, would argue is a dud. Tax dollars are being spent on commercials. As my colleague mentioned, it costs $90,000 for a 30-second ad during NHL playoffs, and it is getting to be more of an expense. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352295">These are Canadian tax dollars being used for something that is just not necessary, while on the other hand, every community across Canada could benefit from the tax dollars being spent on youth summer jobs. Those jobs will go much further in terms of advancing skills for young people. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3352296">However, I believe we need to do a lot more. We need to take a holistic approach. This is where, I would argue, Liberals differ from New Democrats. The previous member who spoke got a little upset with the temporary foreign worker program. There is some reason to be upset with the temporary foreign worker program. Let us recognize that the program has done wonders for our country. It has improved the standard of living for every Canadian and resident in Canada. If it is done properly and managed in the way it was intended to be managed, it is not going to displace one resident or Canadian in this country from a job. It should be building our economy. There are certain industries in Canada today that would not be here if it were not for the temporary foreign worker program.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352297">Unlike the NDP, Liberals see the merits of the program and believe the program has great value, but we also understand that abuse has been taking place and the government has allowed it to take place. The government has failed to recognize how important it is to have the skill set training programs in place to ensure that we are better able to fill the labour market, whether it is today or into the future. The government has not been successful in doing that and, in good part, has been relying on the temporary foreign worker program to fill that gap.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352298">There are many different ways in which the Government of Canada could be demonstrating leadership in ensuring that valued jobs, which are important jobs and could potentially continue to grow our economy, are being filled by Canadians and residents of Canada. One of the most important things it can do is work with different stakeholders. The government has not been known to sit down with stakeholders in provinces and cities to come up with good, sound public policy, but if it genuinely cares about creating jobs and wants Canadians to be employed, it needs to give more attention to this file. That means picking up the telephone and, beyond that, meeting with ministers and trying to line up different types of programs that are being made available, recognizing it has a role to play in that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352299">Far too often I meet with high school students who say they hear about jobs and then ask to what degree they are actually being provided the opportunity to acquire those jobs or to what degree community colleges or universities are working with the private sector and different levels of government to ensure that future jobs are in fact being taken into consideration when the curriculum is being developed. Many would argue that is long term and, yes, it is long term, but there are also short-term things the government can be doing, such as working with stakeholders and providing incentives through the use of tax dollars to ensure there are first-class training opportunities for people who call Canada home, whether they are Canadian citizens or landed immigrants. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352300">We have people who are prepared to do the work. They are looking for strong leadership from the government and other sectors to come to the table to make sure those jobs are in fact going to people who call Canada home.</ParaText>

I would also like to address some of the opportunities our partners in the private sector have to be part of the solution.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352321">Now is a critical time for Canada's economic recovery. While markets are fragile because of global uncertainty, Canada is still on the path toward economic growth and prosperity, but this growth can only be sustained if we have a skilled and knowledgeable workforce, which means that our workers must be equipped with the basic skills required to drive the economy. These skills are building blocks recognized in our government's budget, economic action plan 2013.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352322">The economic action plan proposes new measures to connect Canadians with available jobs and to provide them with the skills and training they need to strive in today's economy. These measures include introducing the new Canada job grant, creating more opportunities for apprentices and providing employment support to underrepresented groups, such as people with disabilities, youth, aboriginal people and newcomers.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352323">While significant money is spent on training, it is clear we can do better. There are still too many unemployed Canadians looking for jobs and too many businesses looking for workers.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352324">I would like to focus on the Canada job grant, which seeks to connect Canadians looking to increase their skills with job creators who need skilled workers.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352325">Mr. Speaker, I forgot to mention that I will be splitting my time with my colleague.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352326">For example, a small dental practice in London, Ontario, might be seeking a new dental assistant. The current receptionist is interested in the position but is not qualified. The dentist is keen to retain this worker in her practice and contributes $2,500 toward a $7,500 Canada job grant. That also results in equal contributions of $2,500 from the federal and provincial governments to allow the receptionist to complete the dental assistant course at the local community college. The original receptionist works with the dentist to hire and train a new receptionist. Now working as a new dental assistant, the employee's wage has increased 25%. That dentist has managed to retain a committed and loyal employee and also has the additional flexibility to manage periodic employee absences by having an employee trained in several areas of the practice.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352327">As members can see from the example, for the first time the Canada job grant is taking skills training choices out of the hands of the government and putting them where they belong: in the hands of job creators and Canadians looking for work.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352328">Given the magnitude of the problem, we must ask all players, including employers and post-secondary institutions, to step up to the plate to address this very serious issue. This is especially true for Canadian companies that want their businesses to grow.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352329">According to a survey conducted by the Conference Board of Canada, the average amount companies spent for employees on training and development in 2011 was $747. Companies allocated 1.5% of their payroll budget to training, down from 2% in the 1990s. As well, 51% of organizations plan to cut spending on training, and 33% of Canadian employees said they wanted to further their skills but did not.</ParaText>

We cannot speak of skills and labour shortages in Canada without mentioning how strongly the future is linked to the economic development of the resources in our country, especially since these resources are so abundant in so many regions. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352361">I have consulted widely with employers and unions across the country with respect to challenges being faced in the workplace. What has come back very clearly to me from both sides is that labour and skills shortages are a major concern of both management and unions. That is why the key focus of our economic action plan 2013 is on skills training and development. It is not just on skills development in general, but on skills and development training that are going to meet specific labour market demands for all Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352362">Our Conservative government recognizes that we have more to do to maximize participation by Canadians in the market, with initiatives that connect more people to the jobs that are available now and in the future. That is where we have been focusing in recent years. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352363">We know that to improve Canada's long-term economic outlook, we need to get more of Canada's underutilized workers and their skills to work. We have been improving the employment insurance program so we can ensure that Canadians have a better connection with the jobs available. We are also working to better connect the EI system to the temporary foreign worker program to ensure that we always put Canadian workers first. That is why economic action plan 2013 would invest significantly in skills and training; to ensure that all Canadian workers have the skills they need to play an active part in the labour market and, ultimately, contribute to our country's economic growth. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352364">Economic action plan 2013 puts forward a three-point plan to connect Canadians with jobs available. Most notably, and this is what we have been speaking about in the House today, is the new Canada jobs grant. It is a very exciting program, because it will potentially provide hundreds of thousands of Canadians each year with $15,000 or more to retrain; $5,000 of this will come from the federal government. The provinces and territories and employers will be expected to match that contribution.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352365">At the time of introducing the economic action plan, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> said:</ParaText><ParaText id="3352366"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The Canada Job Grant will take skills-training choices out of the hands of government and put them where they belong: in the hands of employers [...] and Canadians who want to work.</QuotePara></Quote>

To help reduce barriers to accreditation, we are going to invest $4 million over three years to work with the provinces and the territories to harmonize requirements and examine the use of practical tests as a method of assessment. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352369">We are also going to reform procurement practices. This is very important, because we are going to encourage contractors to hire apprentices on federal construction and maintenance projects. We are going to work with the provinces and territories to ensure that they, too, support the employment of apprentices.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352370">Our third focus in economic action plan 2013 would improve support to groups that are currently under-represented in the job market.

We will also reallocate money over two years to improve labour market information for young people considering careers in those high demand fields, such as the skilled trades, science, technology, engineering and mathematics. These youth-focused initiatives would be accompanied by supports for persons with disabilities, aboriginal people, and of course, for newcomers to help meet the employment needs of Canadian businesses and improve individuals' job prospects along the way.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352373">As anyone with young people knows, young workers entering the workforce face an uncertain job market, while at the same time, some industries in certain sectors face labour shortages that young Canadians could fill. The youth employment strategy, whose budget has been significantly increased over the past few years, is helping youth develop the skills and gain the experience they need to get jobs now and prepare for the workforce of tomorrow. Since 2006, our efforts have helped over 2.1 million young people get skills, training and jobs in the Canadian labour market.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352374">We are also helping young people, and especially students from low-income and middle-income families, by making post-secondary education and training more accessible.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352375">A mix of supports is available to help Canadians save for, finance and repay their post-secondary education. Measures include the Canada learning bond, Canada education savings grant, Canada student grants, Canada student loans and the repayment assistance plan.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352376">The best programs to develop young people's skills and ensure they are adapted to the needs of employers are those that are offered in workplaces. That is especially true in the case of the skilled trades. That is why our government created the apprenticeship grants, which match skills with the jobs available. The apprenticeship incentive grant provides up to $2,000 in grants for an apprentice in a red seal trade who completes the first or second level of their apprenticeship program. The apprenticeship completion grant is a $2,000 cash grant for apprentices who successfully complete their training. In other words, apprentices could be eligible to receive up to $4,000 in grants. I am very happy to say that to date, nearly 400,000 apprenticeship grants have been issued across the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352377">In addition, employers are encouraged to support apprenticeships through the apprenticeship job creation tax credit. This initiative provides employers with a tax credit equal to 10% of the wages paid to apprentices in designated red seal trades in the first two years of their apprenticeship.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352378">There is also a well of talent in rural and remote communities that we believe has not been fully tapped: our aboriginal people. Through our aboriginal labour market programs, our government works with partners to ensure that aboriginal people are able to take full advantage of the economic opportunities around them.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352379">The federal government's primary programs to support the development of aboriginals' skills are the aboriginal skills and employment training strategy and the skills and partnership fund. Through ASETS, significantly funding has been committed from 2010 to 2015 to increase aboriginal participation in the Canadian labour force. With an investment of significant funds, the skills and partnership fund emphasizes our government's commitment to working with partners to develop projects based on economic opportunities.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352380">One thing is certain: we need to think about our labour market differently. We need to use our imagination and creativity in ways we never have before. We have to think outside the box because we have to match workers and jobs. We need to find solutions to situations where we have double-digit unemployment, yet local companies are searching desperately for skilled labour.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352381">I do believe that this is a great step. I am confident that the actions in the economic action plan 2013 will help address the labour and skills shortages.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Sims" id="8023790"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170673" Type="2">Ms. Jinny Jogindera Sims (Newton—North Delta, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3352393">Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today to speak to something that is very important to Canadians today, and that is the skills and labour shortages. Canadians did not really need a lot of media focus on this. They live this every day and they live this because skilled Canadians apply for jobs and are told they do not have skills. Instead, workers are being brought in under the temporary foreign worker program.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352394">Before I get started, I want to talk about the federal Canada jobs grant for workers and all the advertising that has been done. I have heard today in the House that there is some consultation going on. I have also heard from another member that this program is well researched, there is a lot of data and a lot of plans are being made. The fact is that it does not exist. What it does is creates false hope and gives people misinformation because the government is advertising something that does not exist yet. I would ask us all to take a look at that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352395">There is another thing I want to focus on today. I have heard a lot about apprenticeships and skills training. I want to talk a bit about my experiences as a high school counsellor and classroom teacher in a high school for a great number of years. Over the last 25 years, I have personally witnessed the decimation of the apprenticeship program and the dismantling of the skills training that used to exist. I will reference British Columbia specifically because that is the province I am very familiar with.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352396">Just over a decade ago, British Columbia stopped funding in the same way for apprenticeship programs, the grants and things that were available, but something else happened over a decade ago. The tuition costs for the courses that apprentices took tripled and quadrupled overnight. There used to be a different fee level for apprenticeship academic courses compared to university degree courses. The government of the day in British Columbia made the fees the same. It did not lower the fees, by the way, it raised the other fees. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352397">In the high school in Nanaimo that I taught in, there was a huge ricochet effect because suddenly many young students from struggling working-class and middle-class families found they could not afford it. Not only were the grants cut at that time in huge amounts, but also, with the costs going up and the student loan program being changed, it shut the door to a whole generation that would have gone into the skills area.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352398">The other thing that happened was a modular program was brought in, which really put the Red Seal in jeopardy across Canada. It had a huge impact in British Columbia. When we talk about the existing skills shortage, I do not think we should talk about it as if it is something that has just been discovered in the last year or two. I believe this has been systematically created over the last few decades.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352399">It is only recently that the CBC covered a story where well-qualified IT people in a bank, and it happened in many banks after that, were laid off. When they were laid off, they were asked, “Before you leave, could you please train these people we are bringing in from other countries? We are going to be paying them a lot less, they can't do your jobs, train them and move on”.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3352400">That is not creating and nurturing skill development or utilization of the skills we have in Canada. Now we are hearing not one but hundreds of stories of people who say they came to our country to do these so-called high-tech IT jobs. When they came here they did not find it was all that it was made out to be. Many of them ended up doing other jobs.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352401"> There is a pathway to citizenship in there somewhere, but this is what it looks like. If a person is one of those temporary foreign workers who gets a pathway to citizenship and actually gets to apply for permanent residency, guess what happens. Many are coming into MPs' offices and saying that as soon as they get permanent residency, they are laid off because employers would rather bring in another group of temporary foreign workers because they can pay them less. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352402">Therefore, it is very hard for us to believe how serious the Conservatives are about meaningful employment for Canadians where Canadians get to earn a living wage. Instead what we have seen are policies that suppress wages and policies that, from the reports we hear in the agricultural and other sectors, are very abusive relationships in the payment, the recruitment and also in the working lives of some of the workers who come here.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352403">I want to take this opportunity to clarify something that I have said 1,000 times. It appears my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170750" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> has not heard it and is deliberately failing to understand it and thus he misrepresents the NDP position on temporary foreign workers. I have said this 1,000 times, so let me say it again, and I hope my colleague is listening this time and that it will actually sink in.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352404"> The NDP supports a temporary foreign worker program where no Canadian is available to do the work. We support a program that addresses a specific skill shortage, where the needs are identified and temporary foreign workers come in for a temporary time while Canadian skill sets are grown. In the agricultural sector, where there is an acute shortage in many areas, we support a living wage for all and fair working conditions. With all of that in place, if there still are no Canadians available and able to do the work, that is when we look at a temporary foreign worker program.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352405"> It is under the Liberal government, by the way, that the floodgates to temporary foreign workers were opened. I know the huge tsunami of over 400,000 people hit us under the Conservative government, but it could not have taken place without the Liberals, while they were in government, opening up that floodgate. It is important that this be put on the record.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352406">Once again, Canada is a country that has been built through immigration. Almost every one of us, except for a small handful, were either our parents, grandparents or great-great-grandparents came from another country. We came here for a variety of reasons. We came here when there was a labour shortage. I am one of those. I came to Canada when there was a shortage of English teachers in Quebec. I did not come in as a temporary foreign worker. I and my husband came in as permanent residents. That is how we built our country.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="55">(1655)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3352407">If we have a legitimate skills shortage that we cannot fill, and it is only temporary, then I can see why we would use a temporary foreign worker program. However, what we are seeing is that while people in the same part of the country, in the same environment, are on employment insurance and are looking for work, the government has allowed a huge number of temporary foreign workers to come into this country and thus suppress wages. It has also created problems for many who have come into this country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352408">Only yesterday I read an article about a very highly trained IT worker who applied to a huge number of companies. They were all hiring. He thought that being a Canadian and having the skill set he had a crack at the jobs. However, he only heard back from two companies. The rest of them did not even acknowledge the fact that he sent his resumé in. Guess what they did? Guess what has happened to him? He did not get the jobs. Many of the jobs went to what some people call intra-company transfers. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352409">I am going to hear the rhetoric that Conservatives fixed the program, but there is a fundamental flaw, which is that LMOs are given without due diligence and without proper oversight. When they are given that way, Canadians are not aware of the jobs, nor is there an onus on the employer to advertise those jobs in a meaningful way to make sure that it is communicated.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352410">With high unemployment and youth unemployment sitting at double digits, the youth I talk to find it very difficult to talk about the government's economic action plan. They find it very hard to talk about all the jobs being created. All they know is that after getting into huge debt and developing skill sets they thought were going to be in demand, labour is being brought in from other countries, and they are without work. This is where the federal government has to play a role. This is where employers have to play a role as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352411">Industry has an absolute obligation to develop the skill sets it needs, not on its own—I am not saying that—but in partnership. This is where the government has a critical role to play. Instead of passing the buck, it has to work with partners and industry. It has to work with community organizations. It has to work with post-secondary institutions and provide scholarships and affordability so that our youth, and those of us who are not so young but are in need of a change in career, can actually go out and get that training.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352412">I talk to many people in their forties and fifties who are still ready and willing to work for the next 15 or 20 years, but they are being laid off. They are looking to transition into other jobs or just to do their own jobs, which are now being filled through so-called intra-company transfers.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352413">The recent changes to the temporary foreign worker program actually failed to address the administration and enforcement. Of course we have rules that say that an LMO can only be given “if”, but who is making sure the “if” is fulfilled? It seems recently that the way the LMOs were handed out was faster than a McDonald's fast food outlet. People could just walk in and say they wanted one and they were given some.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3352414">Even those that were meant only for highly skilled workers, such as the ALMOs, were handed out. No wonder the public has very little faith and very little trust that the government is there to protect their interests and to look after jobs for Canadians. B.C. is a prime example. There was the mining fiasco, where Mandarin was required while highly qualified and experienced miners were sitting right there, not being hired.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352415">I was just talking to a young man last week as I was going door to door in my beautiful British Columbia, where the sun was shining. What he said to me was that he had heard all the hype about all the jobs that were going to be available in high tech. He spent lots of money, by the way. It was kind of astounding me when he told me the debt load he had. That debt load was much higher than the total price of the first house I bought after I graduated. That is the kind of debt load our youth are going into the future with.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352416"> What he said was that except for working in a bar and occasionally in a restaurant, he has not been able to find any work in his field. This is the field we were encouraging young people to go into, IT.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352417">I do not have to tell members this. They have watched it on television, not that everything we watch on television is true. We have sound evidence in front of us that the IT jobs are being given away. We can call it outsourcing, in-sourcing, intra-company transfers, or the temporary foreign worker program. Whatever we call it, I call it taking jobs out of the hands of Canadians and giving them to people who do not live in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352418">By the way, I just want to make it clear that when I am talking about taking jobs away from Canadians, it includes everybody who lives right here in Canada and has legal status in Canada as a permanent resident. It includes the people who just arrived a few weeks ago.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352419">On Saturday, I was talking to an engineer who is now working as a taxi driver. He is highly skilled, has built bridges and did all kinds of amazing things in his home country. He came here with his skill set in hand. He got permission to come to Canada because of his skill set. However, when he got here, it was not recognized. That is the kind of tension we are creating.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352420">I am hearing this over and over again. Being an English teacher, data is not really my forte, but all kinds of people are telling us, and I agree with them, that to plan for the future and to address the present needs, we need hard data. It seems that the government has an allergy to data. Having data might actually lead to making informed policy decisions. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352421">Over the last number of years, what the government has done is collect less data, data that is less reliable and is not as thorough. We are hearing from industry, as well, that the data available is really not anything we can base future labour market planning on. That should cause us all some serious concern.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352422">When we make policy statements based on ideology rather than on the needs and the reality on the ground, it can only lead to mishaps.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352423">One last thing I have to say is that we have to pay special attention to the needs of our aboriginal communities and the youth. Having worked very closely with the youth in those communities and having watched the high stress levels and high suicide rates, it is time we engaged them in a meaningful way to take an active part in the workforce.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The report is titled, “Labour and Skills Shortages in Canada: Addressing Current and Future Challenges”. Our government supports concurrence in this report because it highlights a very real skills gap facing Canada. I am a member of the human resources committee and I listened to the evidence of the witnesses. My comments will reflect the facts that the witnesses presented. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352449">There are employers who cannot grow their businesses because they cannot find workers with the skills they need. At the same time, there are Canadians looking to fill these jobs but they do not have the skills needed to qualify. This is why our government took further action in budget 2013 to more directly connect skills training to jobs that are currently available. We will do this through the Canada jobs grant. The grant moves training decisions out of the hands of government and into those most qualified to determine in-demand skills, those being employers with unfilled jobs.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352450">Most notably, a new Canada jobs grant will provide up to 130,000 Canadians a year with $15,000 or more to retrain. The amount of $5,000 from that will come from the federal government, with the provinces and territories expected to match that contribution. As our <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> said at the time, “For the first time, the Canada Job Grant will take skills-training choices out of the hands of government and put them where they belong in the hands of employers and Canadians who want to work”. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352451">There are currently thousands of jobs available across Canada going unfilled, at great cost to the economy and all Canadians. With baby boomers starting to retire in large numbers, we are experiencing real skills shortages. This is undermining our country's competitiveness and ongoing economic growth. We are also working to improve the training of apprentices to fill needs in the skills trades. To reduce barriers to accreditation, we will invest over three years to work with provinces and territories to harmonize requirements and examine the use of practical tests as a method of assessment.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352452">We are also reforming procurement practices to encourage contractors to hire apprentices on federal construction and maintenance projects, and we will work with the provinces and territories to ensure that they too support employment of apprentices. Our economic action plan also improves supports to groups who are currently under-represented in the job market, such as youth, Canadians with disabilities, aboriginal people and newcomers to Canada. We want to ensure every Canadian can find a place in the job market because Canadian employers need every last one of them.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352453">With regard to youth, economic action plan 2013 proposes several strategic investments to help them at different stages of their education and careers. For example, to make maximum use of the education and talents of recent graduates, we will, through the career focus program, support 5,000 more paid internships for recent post-secondary graduates. We will also invest over two years to improve labour market information for young people considering careers in high-demand fields, such as the skills trades, science, technology, engineering and mathematics.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352454">Under our government's action plan, Canada will continue to have one of the lowest youth unemployment rates in the G7. Since 2006, our government has helped 2.1 million youth obtain skills training and jobs. This year alone our measures have created 60,000 jobs for youth. Approximately 400,000 Canadian apprenticeship grants have been handed out to youth since 2007, helping thousands of youth fill skilled trades jobs. These youth-focused initiatives are accompanied by supports for persons with disabilities, aboriginal people and newcomers.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3352455">We will continue to work with provinces and territories and stakeholders to enhance the foreign credential recognition processes to increase the successful integration of internationally trained professionals into the job market.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352456">Our ultimate goal is to nurture and enable economic growth by creating more opportunities for all Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352457">There have been several references today to the temporary foreign worker program. Let me be clear. This program was never intended to allow for the outsourcing of Canadian jobs. When concerns were raised about the program, we acted quickly to ensure the interests of Canadian workers came first. Last month we announced several changes to the program. Before issuing a labour market opinion, we will make sure, through beefed-up questions, that the temporary foreign worker program is not used to enable the outsourcing of Canadian jobs.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352458">Through legislative and regulatory amendments currently before the House, we would increase the government's authority to suspend or revoke work permits and labour market opinions if the program is being misused. We would now require employers who rely on temporary foreign workers to have a firm plan in place to transition to a Canadian workforce. Effective immediately, we would also temporarily suspend the accelerated labour market opinion process in order to determine whether it is the best approach. Our goal continues to be to process applications as efficiently as possible, while ensuring that Canadian workers always come first.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352459">In addition, fees for processing LMOs and work permits would be introduced so that taxpayers are no longer obliged to subsidize the cost of processing these applications. We would require that employers who use the program pay temporary foreign workers at or above the average wage for a job. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352460">The opposition voted against providing funding to skills training for Canadians to qualify for jobs that might otherwise have been filled by temporary foreign workers. It has continued to vote against the legislative changes we are attempting to introduce to ensure the government has the tools to discover and crack down on businesses that are abusing the temporary foreign worker program.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352461">I would like to point out that we have put forward measures to help unemployed Canadians access labour market information to transition back into the labour force more quickly. For example, through enhanced job alerts, registered claimants can receive information up to twice daily on jobs available in their area. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352462">We need everyone's skills and talents at work to meet labour market demands and support the economy. We need action on all fronts, which our government is already taking, to create jobs and economic growth that will ensure continued prosperity for all Canadians. Canada is experiencing significant skills shortages in many regions and sectors of the economy, but we must always keep Canadians first whenever there are job openings.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352463">We have heard from a lot of the opposition MPs when it comes to a plan. Well, we have a plan. It is a plan that the opposition has voted against every step of the way. Our economic action plan has delivered on our commitment to Canadians to focus our efforts on jobs, growth and long-term prosperity.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352464">Canadians understood that the economic leadership of our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was a key to navigating the difficult economic times we have faced in the recent past. That trust paid off, by electing a strong and stable national Conservative government. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352465">We have seen the creation of over 900,000 net new jobs. Most are full-time jobs in the private sector, with over two-thirds being in high-wage industries. This reflects the strength of Canada's economy amidst global economic uncertainty. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3352466">As good as these results are, however, our focus is still on getting Canadians back to work. While there are currently thousands of jobs across Canada going unfilled, there are still too many Canadians looking for work. We are confronted with mismatches between the existing skills of the local labour force in some regions and the skills required by employers for new jobs. This is leading to shortages in some occupations that are key to our competitiveness and continued economic growth.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352467"> Therefore, the Conservatives are pleased to support concurrence on this report and to call on all members of this House to work with us to address the skills gap. This can be most directly demonstrated by supporting our economic action plan and the budget implementation act that is now working its way through the House of Commons.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The issue was to get them to grade 12. One of the recommendations was to try to introduce some of the skills and job opportunities in the areas close to the community.

In the next few minutes, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170183" Type="2">Edmonton—Strathcona</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352495">We are focusing our attention on a study tabled by the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities. This report, which is entitled “Addressing Current and Future Challenges”, deals with the labour and skills shortage in Canada. The report does indeed contain some solutions. However, the entire NDP caucus believes that these solutions are highly inadequate.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352496">Committee members spoke at length about certain recurring points, such as the lack of interest in skilled trades observed throughout the provinces. For several decades now, post-secondary education has been promoted and a BA or other degree has been touted as the key to success. Now, this is causing a significant lack of people with training in skilled trades, and there is a shortage of plumbers and electricians across the country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352497">In 2008, before the economic crisis and the never-ending economic difficulties, there were signs all along highway 20. Just outside Beloeil, there was a giant sign that said “we are looking for” or “we are looking to hire 12 electricians tomorrow morning”. At the time, before the recent crisis, there was already a labour shortage, particularly in the skilled trades.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352498">The bad news is that, if we are fortunate enough to see a true economic recovery in 2014-15, we will be in exactly the same position, with the same problems we had in 2008. Billions of dollars have been invested in the Conservative government's much-vaunted economic action plans over the past few years. The government could have shown some vision, but it did not. It sometimes even made mistakes. If there is an economic recovery tomorrow, the day after tomorrow or in 2014, we will be in the same position as we were in 2008.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352499">The good news is that, when it came right down to it, all members recognized that the major challenge of the first half of the 21st century would be a lack of human resources. Conservative and NDP members agreed on this.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352500">The not-so-good news is that the government engaged in a completely ridiculous exercise, which is particularly evident at the end of the report, where almost all of the testimony was manipulated. For example, the Conservative majority linked everything that the witnesses said to 2012 budget initiatives.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352501">A standing committee should be a place where members have all the freedom they need to recommend to a minister whether an initiative should be carried out in a certain way, or faster or slower, and so on. Such a place no longer exists.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352502">Witnesses are now being ground down by the Conservative majority, which hacks every argument to bits until each little piece falls into place and conforms with ministers' decisions made months or even a year ago.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352503">Thus, the committees are being completely manipulated. We have known this for the past two years. In this report, however, this exercise is no longer simply verging on the absurd; it has become wholly and utterly absurd.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352504">There is another problem. Throughout the study, this obsession with reducing the size of government was apparent. Let us clear this up once and for all. There are times when the government must support a vision. In order to do so, it sometimes has to spend a little money in order to make more money. Yes, the government can do that. It sounds crazy, but it has happened in the past.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352505">Today we are faced with a huge challenge. We will not have enough human resources, especially entrepreneurs. Quebec alone needs 70,000 people to ensure the entrepreneurial succession of SMEs. That is the big challenge facing our economy and it is by far this government's favourite subject.</ParaText>

Depending on the program and province, 30% to 40% of apprentices drop out. Because the government tries to save a few thousand dollars by failing to support the apprentice for the duration of his apprenticeship, that apprentice resorts to employment insurance or social assistance or returns to an unstable job.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352509">Instead of responding to an urgent need, like the need to have more electricians who earn excellent salaries, we lose that young apprentice. We lose a taxpayer who might have earned an annual salary of $35,000, $45,000, $55,000, $65,000, or $70,000. All because the Conservatives are obsessed with reducing the size of government. The Conservatives do not understand that sometimes they need to invest a bit of money simply to generate wealth and purchasing power. The return on investment can be tenfold or better over a period of 5 to 10 years. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352510">The members opposite do not have this on their radar even though the witnesses agreed that the government needs to make more of an effort and invest more in order to successfully meet this tremendous challenge.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352511">The NDP agrees with a number of the recommendations in the report. I will go over a few of them here. However, none of them go far enough. The Conservatives' logic seems to be, “this is something important that the government should do, but it will cost a lot of money, so let us pretend we did not see it”. It is dizzying.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352512">Let us now look at the second recommendation in the report: </ParaText><ParaText id="3352513"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The Committee recommends that the Government of Canada continue its efforts toward achieving better and more user-friendly labour market information, which could [note: could] in turn [if they get that far] be provided to students, graduates and job seekers...</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3352514">They are so hypocritical.

It has been launched in a rather dogmatic fashion. We know that the provinces were not consulted. What is more, the provinces are opposed to the program for the good reason that training is their jurisdiction. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352528">SME employers and entrepreneurs are also opposed to the program for a very simple reason. The federal-provincial-SME partnership will provide a $15,000 grant. It is much more difficult for a small business that urgently needs to train a plumber, for example, or for an SME in an outlying area than for Bombardier or a major car manufacturer in southern Ontario to pay its one-third share of the grant. Small businesses believe that the program is completely ill-conceived. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352529">Furthermore, employers contribute to the employment insurance fund, and this money is systematically put into the consolidated revenue fund. What happens to this money? We really are not sure. The government buys British submarines that do not work or things like that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352530">Instead, the fund should be built up, and we should sit down with these people and tell them that we have the money if they need apprentices or training programs.</ParaText>

If it is found that they have difficulty entering the job market because they cannot read, for example, they receive employment insurance for several weeks while they learn to read. Yes, it does cost money, but in the end, someone who is literate can enter the job market with skills. He or she can meet the needs of service businesses that are having difficulty finding people just to be cashiers.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352532">Until we address the structural problem, we will not make any progress, and business people's money will continue to go into a fund that will be squandered.

I commend our representatives for their additional recommendations and for bringing this matter forward to the House. We have had an excellent debate today.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352543">There is one thing that troubles me in going through the report. I will go through this in great detail because it is of most interest to me, particularly because a lot of the recommendations raise programs that the government has historically funded, but has made the decision of late to de-fund.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352544">I go to recommendation 1, formal public-private academic partnerships to coordinate labour market evaluations. As I mentioned earlier in the House, I have had the privilege of sitting on the environment sector table board for seven years. The government has decided to end that organization, along with all the other sector tables.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352545"> The value of the environment sector table, which was ECO Canada, Environmental Careers Organization Canada,  was that several times a year it did labour market analyses. Year after year it showed that the highest growing area of employment in our country, in fact worldwide, was in the environmental field. There are endless possibilities for work, endless opportunities for aboriginal Canadians and recent immigrants. The government is ending these sector tables. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352546">One of the things this organization did was form partnerships between universities and small colleges with industry, with the community and with first nation communities on identifying needed jobs and areas of activity where we could be working together.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352547">Another recommendation that I find rather odd is recommendation 14, which encourages young people to acquire work experience through the Canada summer jobs program, particularly including French-English language development.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352548">It is sad to report to the House that for more than half of the jobs under the Canada summer jobs program in my riding for which there was huge demand, as I have three university campuses and one technical college campus, many people were providing opportunity for students. Many of those were bilingual opportunities, and they were not funded. Why? Because the government is not funding that program adequately.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352549">Very sadly, also, the government decided to shut down its funding for the Experimental Lakes Area. That was one of the best programs for providing science-based job opportunities for university students. The government de-funded it, and yet it signed off on a recommendation in the report to create those exact kinds of programs.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352550">As the government moves forward and responds to this report, which is invaluable, I am looking forward to it perhaps reconsidering some of the decisions to cut the funding for these very important programs.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352551">As Shawn Atleo, the National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations, pointed out, in the area of aboriginal Canadians, far more aboriginal youth are being incarcerated than graduating from high school, yet the government still continues to underfund the education opportunities for students, including at university level and technical schools. There is, as I understand, 13,000 students waiting to get into these programs, but there are insufficient funds.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352552">It is one thing to sign off on the report and make recommendations, it is another thing to actually budget for it and support programs.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352553">My final comment would be what my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170673" Type="2">Newton—North Delta</Affiliation> asked, which was why the government was not working on the skill set for the next decade. I had many young people in my riding lined up to start companies to do energy efficiency audits and energy retrofits in homes.

They were all calling for the timely implementation of today's legislation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352678">Permit me to share with the House and with all Canadians some snippets of what we heard at committee, all underlining the lengthy process to get this legislation to this stage and the importance of Parliament finally adopting it.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352679">First, allow me to quote from the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants, which said:</ParaText><ParaText id="3352680"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> Bill C-48 marks the end of a very long road, one with many twists and turns over the years.

The CTA said:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352684"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">We live in a rapidly changing world, and this legislation must respond dynamically to changes in commercial transactions. Can you imagine how much work would be required if you made no repairs to your home or your car for more than 10 years? That is what has happened with these two statutes. The last bill addressing technical amendments was passed in 2001. ... [The Technical Tax Amendments Act, 2012] represents 10 years of repairs and maintenance in updating the Income Tax Act and the Excise Tax Act. Its passage is important to all Canadians. ... I want to emphasize it again. Its passage is very important to all Canadians. ... Delays in the passage of tax legislation leave taxpayers and their advisers in a no man's land of uncertainty.

The Certified General Accountant's Association of Canada told finance committee:</ParaText><ParaText id="3352686"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...we encourage you to move swiftly to pass this important piece of legislation. The bill deals with a massive backlog of unlegislated tax measures. Its passage would, in our opinion, bring greater clarity to the tax system and strengthen the integrity of our laws.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3352687">We all know these delayed technical amendments cause serious difficulties for taxpayers, businesses, professional accountants and their clients, and of course, government. We heard some very vocal support for the technical tax amendments act, 2012 at finance committee from these and many other public interest organizations and tax professionals. The support was a big part of the reason the legislation received unanimous support from all members, from all parties, on the committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352688">For those watching at home, and parliamentarians, I want to briefly recap the content of the technical tax amendments act, 2012. As I alluded to earlier, the vast majority of these amendments have already been publicly released in either a previous budget or a previous technical tax bill. In addition to that, the vast majority of it was previously and extensively released prior to introduction during the multiple public consultation phases. The ultimate legislation, in point of fact, incorporates a tremendous amount of the feedback provided by Canadians during those many public consultations.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352689">Today's act, among other things, would further simplify Canada's tax system through numerous technical amendments to the Income Tax Act, the Excise Tax Act and related legislation. I would like to further add that today's legislation also takes key steps to close some tax loopholes to create a stronger and fairer tax system for all Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352690">I want to quickly review the legislation, part by part, to highlight some key measures and what they hope to achieve. Even though today's act is obviously extremely technical in nature and includes seven different sections, I will keep my remarks brief.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352691">I will commence with Part 1 of the bill, which would modify the Income Tax Act by taking into account comments we received during our extensive consultations and which would create simpler rules for non-resident trusts.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352692">Parts 2 and 3 deal directly with the taxation of Canadian multinational corporations with foreign affiliates, implementing changes, some of which date all the way back to 2004, that would make Canada's tax system more fair and equitable, and of course, easier to administer. As is the case with the majority of measures contained in the bill, these changes, again, are the result of extensive public consultations.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352693">Part 4 of the bill deals with the concept of bijuralism. More specifically, it contains amendments that will ensure that the bill will function effectively under both common and civil law. This means that amendments dealing with certain legal concepts, such as rights, interest, real and personal property, life estate and remainder interest, tangible and intangible property, and joint and several liability, will accurately capture common and civil law in both official languages. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352694">Part 5 of the bill is designed with fairness for taxpayers in mind and sets out to close tax loopholes to ensure that Canadians would carry their fair share. The act would close tax loopholes related to specified leasing property, ensure that conversion as specified investment flow through trusts and partnerships into corporations are subject to the same rules as transactions through corporations—</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The response I got from the <Affiliation DbId="170861" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> at the time was that the deployment of RCMP assets was an operational decision of the RCMP and not related to a decision of this particular administration.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352730">It is a loss for the airport in Victoria, which is actually in Sidney, B.C. in my riding. The presence of these RCMP officers was enormously helpful. With dedicated RCMP officers at the Victoria airport, there was coverage seven days a week. Now if there are problems at the airport, the local RCMP detachment based in Sidney would have to juggle other calls and demands in order to come to the airport. It is a busy airport and the RCMP presence was very important for security. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352731">As well, the RCMP presence was withdrawn from Kelowna. Although Kelowna is in quite a spectacularly beautiful part of Canada, in the Okanagan, it happens to be, according to security experts with whom I have consulted, something of a thoroughfare for the smuggling of drugs and weapons. It is in an area where there are significant markets in northern Alberta and, without the RCMP detachment at the Kelowna airport, there is a concern that there will be an increase in drug dealing and other offences.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352732"> This comes at the same time as significant cutbacks in border security agents. According to the union representing the border guards, the Canada Border Services Agency has had cuts of up to 1,000 people. A lot of us saw the news coverage of the loss of the canine division, which was very efficient, effective and accurate at detecting the presence of illicit drugs and narcotics and so forth at borders. We have lost the canine division, we have lost the workforce of Canada Border Services agents who worked with that canine force, and we are losing security along the Canada–U.S. border at the same time that these cutbacks at the RCMP have lost us protection in our airports.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352733">I have to say that I find this rather baffling, coming from an administration that has fashioned itself as being tough on crime and as being one that wants to protect Canada and Canadians from the threats of violent crime and the threats of illegal and illicit activity. This is in fact not just affecting particularly the Canada Border Services agents, not just affecting so-called backroom arrangements, agents and operations, but actually will affect the front-line operations of border security agents in such a way that the president of the union feels that smugglers will get the upper hand.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352734">It really would be appropriate for the federal government to revisit these ill-advised cuts and to restore and replace the presence of RCMP officers in the class 2 airports, such as in Victoria and in Kelowna, and at the same time to revisit the cutting of border security agents. These are ill-conceived cuts that will cause far more damage through the loss of security than they can possibly gain in austerity.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Now we will proceed into the first rotation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352907">Resuming debate, the hon. member for Vegreville—Wainwright. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Benoit" id="8024696"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170662" Type="2">Mr. Leon Benoit (Vegreville—Wainwright, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3352908">Mr. Chair, I am delighted to participate in this debate here tonight. Canadians are very fortunate, as I think we all know, that our country is wealthy in natural resources, and we are the envy of many other countries around the world.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352909">For generations natural resources have brought opportunity, jobs and growth to every region of this country, and today natural resources account for 15% of our gross domestic product and 50% of our exports. When we include the spinoff industries that provide goods and services to this sector, natural resources account for close to 20% of our GDP, nearly one-fifth of our economy. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352910">Specifically, the energy, mining and forestry industries provide over $30 billion a year in revenue to governments, money that supports critical social programs such as health, education, pensions and old age security. That $30 billion is equal to half the spending by all governments together on hospitals last year. Therefore, those MPs across the way who oppose all natural resource development—and that would be the New Democrats—are slowing development, which means that they are limiting the amount of money available for health care and other social programs.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352911"> Other benefits include jobs. About 800,000 Canadians work directly in natural resources, while another 800,000 are employed in sectors that serve the natural resource industries. Added up, close to 1.6 million Canadians depend on natural resources for their jobs, making up 10% of all employment in Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352912">Importantly, these are good jobs. My wife Linda and I have five children, and all five of them work in the natural resource sector. All five of them have good jobs because of the success of the businesses in the sector. Not only that, they are all married, and all five of their spouses work in the natural resource sector and have good wages and good jobs. That is something we should all take pride in, instead of working against it, as some across the floor would do.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352913">At the same time, over the next 10 years over 600 major natural resource projects will be under way across this country. That means about $650 billion in spending on major natural resource projects over the next 10 years. With these opportunities at hand, the Government of Canada is working to increase Canadian trade and investment to facilitate the expansion of Canada's natural resource infrastructure. Sadly, the New Democrats are working against this development as well. They oppose any pipeline that has ever been proposed. They oppose projects like that, and they probably will continue to do so. They laugh about it, but it is a serious issue.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352914">Now I want to talk a bit about our responsible resource development. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352915">To capitalize on these opportunities, our plan for responsible resource development will ensure Canada's regulatory regime is among the most efficient and competitive anywhere in the world. Responsible resource development has put in place more predictable and timely reviews with fixed end dates and will end unnecessary duplication with provincial regimes that meet federal requirements to deliver on our shared objective of one project, one review. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352916">These changes will save time and money, providing the certainty that investors demand. In fact, the reality is that with this accelerated and streamlined process, if a project is given the “no” answer and a company is told that it cannot go ahead, it would much rather that happen after a two-year period than after the eight years that it often takes now for some of the larger projects. Even if the answer is no, it is a lot easier for a company to take if it has invested less time and money in the project.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352917">However, our approach is not just about developing resources efficiently; it is about developing them responsibly. For this reason, our government is committed to protecting the environment. Simply put, we will not approve projects unless they can be done safely.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="20">(2020)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3352918">It is not a question of either developing our natural resources or protecting the environment; we can do both and we must do both. Responsible resource development will ensure stronger environmental protection by increasing our focus on major projects with the most potential for significant environmental impacts on areas of federal jurisdiction and through the introduction of new measures to strengthen compliance and enforcement, including tough new fines for companies that break environmental safety laws.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352919">The Government of Canada has also taken action to strengthen pipeline safety as a part of our plan for responsible resource development. For example, budget 2012 provided the National Energy Board with $13.5 million more to increase the number of annual inspections on oil and gas pipelines by 50%. That would increase the number of inspections by 50%, from 100 to 150, to improve pipeline safety right across this country.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352920">Further, the government is doubling, from three to six, the number of comprehensive annual audits of oil and gas pipelines to identify potential safety issues before they occur.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352921">On March 18, 2013, we also announced a comprehensive set of measures to ensure we have in place a world-class marine safety system, including a tanker safety expert panel to review Canada's spill response requirements, a review of the liability and compensation regime to ensure the polluter pays for all the costs of cleanup, scientific research on marine pollution risks, the creation of an incident command structure to strengthen emergency response oversight and new investments in navigational aids, inspections, surveillance and monitoring.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352922">Our goal is to prevent incidents from happening, to strengthen our response capacity in the unlikely event that an incident does occur and to ensure that Canadian taxpayers are not left on the hook for the cost of the cleanup.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352923">Responsible resource development also includes a commitment to ensuring more meaningful and consistent consultation with aboriginal peoples and exploring new economic partnerships with aboriginal groups.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352924">The government also recently announced the appointment of a special federal representative to engage aboriginal communities on aboriginal opportunities related to proposed west coast energy infrastructure, such as oil and gas pipelines and marine terminals.</ParaText><ParaText id="3352925">These efforts will help identify opportunities to facilitate greater aboriginal participation in resource development as well as in our ongoing efforts to strengthen environmental protection.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352926">Quite frankly, we have already seen that development and that engagement of aboriginal people. In the oil sands we have seen companies that are led by aboriginal people and owned by aboriginal people. This model can certainly be expanded.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="25">(2025)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3352927">Just recently—in fact, yesterday—I came back from a meeting of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. I chair one of the economic committees in that group. We are doing a study on unconventional gas and oil production. At those meetings, we get the message very clearly that Canada had better be as quick as it possibly can in developing liquid natural gas terminals or it will simply be done by other countries around the world. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352928">The United States already has applied for export permits for natural gas. Australia will very soon become the largest producer and exporter of natural gas in the world. The competition is there. We cannot just assume that in Canada we can take our time to develop these liquid natural gas exports and that the markets will be there for us. The reality is that with the cost of the infrastructure required to develop an LNG project, well over $10 billion, long-term contracts and investment from the country buying the gas are going to be involved. Off the west coast, we could expect China to be one of those, so it is important that we move ahead at the fastest pace that we possibly can.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3352929">In closing, I would just like to say that we have done one of the most beneficial things that governments have done in the last many years, probably since the free trade agreement. In putting in place this responsible resource development program, which is a comprehensive program, we have done an awful lot that will allow natural resource industries to move ahead in the future. </ParaText><ParaText id="3352930">I am looking forward to that happening.</ParaText>

I plan on using the full 15 minutes to make a few comments. However, I also want to pose a few questions for the minister as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353009">My comments and question will primarily focus on pipelines and specifically on our position on the economic potential brought by a west-east pipeline and the safety aspects of bringing oil to the east.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353010">Canada is among the world's leading energy producers. We have the world's fifth largest producer of oil and the third largest proven reserves, estimated at 173 billion barrels, mostly in the oil sands.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353011">As we heard at the natural resources committee, the global demand for crude oil is projected to increase for the next 25 years and beyond, especially in emerging economies. We are the third largest producer of natural gas, with marketable natural gas resources estimated to be as high as 1,300 trillion cubic feet. These are enormous resources and the development of these resources is supporting Canadian prosperity, as we heard comments previously.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353012">Directly and indirectly, Canada's energy sector supports hundreds of thousands of jobs a year for Canadians. The oil sands alone support jobs for some 275,000 people, jobs right across the country in every sector of the economy, such as skilled trades, manufacturing, clerical jobs, the financial sector, everywhere. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3353013">The energy sector is also a key source of revenue for governments at all levels. For example, over the past five years the oil and gas extraction industries have added an average of $22 billion a year to government revenues.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353014">Canada has the energy resources that the world needs. Our challenge going forward is being able to get these valuable resources, oil and natural gas, to tidewater and then to global markets. The solution is an expansion of Canada's energy infrastructure. The energy sector knows this and so does our government, and we are working to facilitate success for this vital economic sector.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353015">Canada's crude oil pipeline system is integrated with the North American pipeline network and nearly all of our oil goes to the United States. Current maximum crude oil pipeline capacity out of Canada is 3.5 million barrels per day. </ParaText><ParaText id="3353016">As western Canadian crude oil production has continued to grow, this production increase has overwhelmed existing pipelines. Canadian crude has oversupplied the local western Canadian market, driving Canadian crude oil prices lower than the prices of similar crudes globally.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353017">Similarly, growing western Canadian and U.S. crude production has oversupplied the Cushing, Oklahoma crude market where West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices are set. West Texas Intermediate is also steeply discounted compared to the prices of similar crudes globally. This is important to Canada as most of our crude sales to the U.S. receive a price influenced by West Texas Intermediate.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3353018">What is more, Canadian crude oil production is still growing and pipeline capacity has not kept pace. Canadian crude oil producers currently need more pipeline capacity than is available.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353019">I would like to remind members of the House that pipelines are not just an Alberta or western Canadian issue. Canada's eastern refineries currently have the industry's lowest profit margins. For example, the majority of crude oil consumed in Quebec comes from higher priced international markets and currently costs more than $100 a barrel as of May 6. We also know that the Irving refinery in New Brunswick, where I am from, also imports large amounts of its crude.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353020">Over the past six months, I know the minister has done a fair amount of travelling. He has been to Saint John, New Brunswick to visit the oil refinery and the Irving refinery. He has also seen first-hand that Canadian refineries can process substantially more Canadian oil, generating more jobs and making our country less reliant on more expensive foreign oil.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353021">Because of a lack of pipeline capacity, the Irving refinery and indeed Quebec currently import crude oil from foreign countries, some with much less stringent environmental standards. The Suncor refinery in Montreal is not currently processing western crude at all but crude from such far-flung sources as Africa, the Middle East and the North Sea. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="55">(2055)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3353022">The Irving refinery, in addition to offshore oil, is also bringing significant quantities of western U.S. oil to Saint John via rail. That could be upwards of 90,000 barrels a day coming into Saint John via rail from the western U.S.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353023">I know our government supports the idea of a pipeline to the east that would bring lower cost Canadian crude to consumers and refineries in Quebec and Atlantic Canada. Such a pipeline to eastern Canada would create new jobs and economic growth across the country, particularly in Quebec and Atlantic Canada. According to Christopher Smillie, senior advisor of government relations for the Canadian Building Trades, even though direct pipeline construction jobs last on average three seasons, he said “the vast bulk of jobs created last for 50 years or more...pipelines link together jobs from one end of the production chain to the other...” That was in our natural resources report, which was tabled in the House on May 2, 2012.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353024">This would allow Canadian refineries to process substantially more Canadian oil, making our country less reliant on more expensive foreign oil. Access to Canada's western crude would allow for lower prices than overseas crude and would help in maintaining the profitability of this refinery and other refineries in eastern Canada.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3353025">With regard to our May 9, 2013 committee on natural resources, I think it is important to say something for the record because it talks to the importance of bringing crude from west to east. I want to refer to comments by Mr. Daniel Cloutier in that meeting, when he was talking about the line 9, I guess we would call it re-reversal. He said:</ParaText><ParaText id="3353026"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">We therefore believe that for the future viability of the Suncor and Ultramar refineries in Quebec, we need a reliable supply of affordable oil that will allow us to compete on equal terms. Maintaining the refineries is also indispensable to the petrochemical industry. The Parachem and CEPSA plants in eastern Montreal, for example, are very dependent on the survival of the Suncor refinery. Losing that Montreal Suncor refinery would, therefore, likely create a chain reaction affecting a number of other employers and threatening to cause a shut down as well. The Line 9 reversal project is currently generating the kind of excitement that has not been seen in eastern Montreal for years, a decade in fact. We now see a number of projects in preparation, with all the players positioning themselves. And we know right now that the reversal will lead to the investment in Quebec refineries, which will have to develop, among other things, units that can handle Canadian crude.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3353027">In addition, what was interesting today at our natural resources committee is that John Telford, director of Canadian affairs for the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbers and Pipe Fitting Industry also talked about west-east being right after Keystone in his priorities. Sarnia, Montreal and in fact New Brunswick, would all benefit, and he said that New Brunswick definitely needs that help. Being a New Brunswick MP, we certainly would like to have the economic benefits.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353028">The Saint John delegation, which included the hardworking MP for <Affiliation DbId="170164" Type="2">Saint John</Affiliation>, was in Calgary last week to hear very positive news. </ParaText><ParaText id="3353029">With regard to some of the things the minister has learned on export markets, could he talk about the position on east-west pipeline, specifically the benefits of not having more oil in the east refined at the Irving refinery, and maybe more specifically on the ability to get our product to deep water and the benefits of that to Canada?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The Keystone XL and Enbridge expansions would move oil south, and the proposed northern gateway and trans-mountain expansion would move Canadian oil to tidewater on the west coast. That said, independent regulators will conduct comprehensive, objective, scientific evaluations to determine whether any specific project passes regulatory muster and is safe for Canadians and for the environment.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353033">The demand to move oil has clearly outstripped the capacity of the North American pipeline network, and as indicated, railways are filling some of this gap for now. However, there is no question that one of the safest and most reliable ways to move very large quantities of oil, as the minister pointed out, is through pipelines. With our plan for responsible resource development, our government has taken steps to enhance our pipeline safety. I know the line 9 reversal proposal is currently before our independent regulator, the National Energy Board, to review that.</ParaText>

One of the things we need to realize and grasp about the Canadian economy and what is important to Canadians is the importance of the natural resources industry. When we look at our industries that export and create jobs, the natural resources sector, particularly in certain areas of the country, tends to be dominant. We also need to grasp and understand that many of the jobs in the service sector in places such as Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver are based on the natural resources industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353111">Tonight the specific aspect that I wish to concentrate on is what mining means to this country in terms of the Canadian economy and jobs for people all across this country. </ParaText><ParaText id="3353112">I have a particular interest in this subject that has to do with my occupation prior to being elected to the House of Commons. I was trained and proudly graduated from the University of Saskatchewan as a geophysicist. This was in the era when there was $20 oil and the price of gold was considerably lower. Now we talk about how the rich oil and mining companies make money, but there have been years when it has been fairly tough to make a living in this industry.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3353113">I worked and got great experience in northern Quebec, our three territories of Nunavut, the Northwest Territories and the Yukon, and of course Saskatchewan and the neighbouring province of Manitoba. This personal experience in the industry impacts to this very day how I approach policy issues and my understanding of the various things that impact and affect mining and natural resource development specifically. Let me give an example. </ParaText><ParaText id="3353114">Frequently in the House we have dealt with legislation that has to do with the regulatory impacts, meaning regulation and what it means to mining. We in Canada should be proud of our environmental record on mining. There have been grave problems in certain instances, but in general we should be proud. </ParaText><ParaText id="3353115">I think of a specific time when I was working as a junior geophysicist in northern Manitoba and was talking with a senior geologist, a gentleman with close to 20 years of experience. </ParaText><ParaText id="3353116">Geology is one of those occupations that cannot be learned in the classroom. It takes a certain maturing and a certain degree of field experience. It does not matter how long one spends in the classroom; one cannot overestimate the value of that experience.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3353117">However, this senior geologist, someone with 20 years of field experience, was explaining to me that more than 50% of his time was spent dealing with regulations and permits, things that, while necessary, were not fundamental things for which his experience as a geologist would be of most use and impact. </ParaText><ParaText id="3353118">That, to this day, has impacted how I think about the industry. There is so much productivity in our mining industry and in our workforce, but we do things to hold it back and slow down what we have there. </ParaText><ParaText id="3353119">We need to grasp who it is that works in the mining industry. We know about the financial sector in Vancouver and Toronto, which I will talk about, but in areas of northern Canada where the aboriginal population in places like Nunavut does not have to this day a very strong, functioning economy in the historic sense based upon trapping and the various traditional arts, mining has in many cases been the only economic driver. </ParaText><ParaText id="3353120">We see that in Nunavut and in northern Saskatchewan. This is an industry that does not pay poor wages; it pays top-dollar wages, not just for highly skilled tradespeople such as electricians and people who work some of the equipment but for miners, because it is tough work. These people very much deserve the wages they receive, and they are very productive because of the high capital put into it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3353121">Coming from Saskatchewan, I can ask what mining fundamentally means to my home province. For people listening tonight, the answer is that Saskatchewan is the province most dependent on mining in the whole country on a per capita basis. It is one of the reasons that Saskatchewan is, per capita, also the province in the country with the highest degree of international exports and the least dependence upon the U.S. market. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="25">(2125)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3353122">Potash in our province is a $7-billion-a-year industry. It has attracted some very large companies. BHP Billiton, the largest company in the world, is looking at building, in the corner of my constituency, an approximately $10-billion mine, give or take a few billion dollars. That is the sort of impact it has in areas such as Saskatoon. Other companies, such as Mosaic and PCS, a Saskatchewan headquartered potash giant, the largest in the world, are from Saskatchewan. Along with Vancouver and Toronto, Saskatoon is becoming the third capital of mining in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353123">What does mining mean, and not just to areas in the remote north, not just to places like Baffin Island, where we are looking at a brand new iron ore deposit, or places like northern Ontario? I see my hon. friend, who is a big fan of the Ring of Fire and the potential development there. What else does it mean to places like Toronto or Vancouver, places that we do not always automatically connect with the mining sector? </ParaText><ParaText id="3353124">Let me throw out a few facts from the TSX Venture Exchange mining stocks. The percentage of the world's public mining companies listed in Canada: 58%. The ranking in the world for publicly listed: number 1. The number of listed mining companies: 1,665. The number of companies that have mines in production or under development: 326. The numbers go on and show how important mining is to Canada.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3353125">Canadian-headquartered mining companies accounted for nearly 37% of budgeted worldwide exploration expenditures in 2012. That means that our lawyers, finance people, accountants, technical people, and legal people have good jobs in the service sector in places such as Vancouver and Toronto. The jobs spin out. We see this in things like the quality of our education, such as at the world-class mining program we find at Queen's University in Kingston. We in Canada are proud of this history. We see it in our scientific research as the world's leader per capita, and very close in real numbers, in terms of knowledge and the number of geological papers produced.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353126">At the base of it, mining is important to all of Canada. Twenty per cent of our exports come from mining, and this does not include oil and gas, which is shipped through the pipelines. Mining is good for Canada, particularly northern Canada, as it is often the only thing there for building its economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353127">How has the government and the natural resources committee been working and dealing with supporting mining? Earlier this year, we did a report on development in northern Canada. We broadly and loosely defined the term, but again and again, the overwhelming theme that came out was the importance of mining, the importance of connecting what is down in the south with what is up in the north. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3353128">A couple of major themes began to emerge in that report, and we see this throughout everything we are doing. The first is that regulatory changes have an impact. They make a difference. We were talking today in committee about another subject. Thankfully, this involved the United States, where it took 14 years to get permitting done for a project that took only 18 months to get into play. We do not see that in the Canadian mining sector anymore. In fact, one of the things that makes us competitive is the way the federal government has been working in coordination with the provinces to increase regulatory changes that make sense. As someone who experienced that as a junior geophysicist talking with a senior geologist, I understand how that has an impact on the ground.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353129">A second major theme we have been noting is labour force changes. It takes a great deal of skill. People often deride Canadians as hewers of wood and haulers of water, as if extracting natural resources is not something to be proud of. Some of the world's most profitable companies today are extracting natural resources. There are major dollars and large incomes. One hundred thousand dollar a year jobs are not uncommon in this industry.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="30">(2130)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3353130"> Those are two areas where the government has been working with the industry and the general public to get them involved. It is providing and streamlining regulatory changes and labour force changes to provide a workforce for the industry and better jobs for Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353131">As I noted earlier, potash is very important to the province of Saskatchewan. We are also fairly unique as one of the world's major producers of uranium. Along with Kazakhstan and Australia, we are one of the big three. The entire uranium-producing industry in Canada is now located in the province of Saskatchewan.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353132">I wish to ask the parliamentary secretary about the government's approach to regulation and the uranium sector. I am particularly interested in knowing about the regulations and the approach we have had to uranium and to the nuclear sector.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353133">Perhaps the parliamentary secretary would also provide a bit of a contrast with the positions the other parties have taken on this issue and explain how this resource is mined safely, what the strict regulations are and what the government's view on uranium and mining regulations is.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Our government supports safe and responsible uranium production. We all know that it is a highly regulated industry, and it has been since the beginning. It needs to pass muster with our independent regulatory agency as well. The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, of course, is that regulator.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353136">Over the last few years, we have promoted trade in the uranium sector by signing new agreements with China and India, two of the largest uranium users in the world. Those agreements insist that they use uranium for peaceful means and peaceful uses.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353137"> This has created jobs. It has created growth, particularly in our province of Saskatchewan but also right across the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353138">On the other hand, I need to point out that the NDP has been very clear that it opposes nuclear energy in all its forms.

However, it has been particularly vehement in its opposition to the nuclear industry in all forms.</ParaText>

He does an excellent job in his leadership role as the <Affiliation DbId="170686" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353204">As a member of Parliament from Alberta, natural resources are absolutely vital and important to our economy. We could not have a better minister looking after that portfolio.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353205">I am grateful for the opportunity to be part of this important debate. I will discuss our priorities for the natural resources portfolio.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353206">On May 2, 2011, Canadians gave our government a strong mandate to focus on jobs and the economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353207"> Since the depths of the global recession, Canada's economy has created over 950,000 net new jobs. This is the best performance in the G7. Our real GDP is now significantly higher than pre-recession levels, again the best performance in the G7.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353208">However, we still face a fragile global economic recovery and too many Canadians are still looking for work. That is why we are squarely focused on implementing economic action plan 2013, our low-tax plan to create jobs, growth and long-term prosperity for Canadians.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3353209">The economy is a top priority for our government. Our natural resource sectors contribute significantly to our economic success, generating close to 1.6 million jobs and driving almost 20% of our GDP. Canada is the world's fifth largest producer of oil and just our proven reserves are the third largest in the world at 173 billion barrels and as technology advances, more will become available.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353210">We are also the third largest producer of natural gas. In fact, our recoverable gas resources are estimated to be as high as 1,300 trillion cubic feet.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353211">The oil sands in particular have become one of Canada's great economic engines. This resource has attracted more than $185 billion in investment, $25 billion in the last year alone.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353212">Over the past five years, royalties and taxes generated by the energy sector have added $25 billion a year to government coffers. That helps to pay for everything from roads and bridges to education and health care, the core services and infrastructure that Canadians depend on every day in every part of our country.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353213">Within the next 25 years, the oil sands alone could be supporting 630,000 Canadian jobs, not just in Alberta but right across the entire country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3353214">Canada has some very significant energy resources for export. We are about to become a major player in global energy markets through our exports of liquefied natural gas and oil, a role in which Canada can offer energy security and economic stability to the world. This is why it is so critical that we have the capacity to deliver this resource to new markets.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353215">It will come as no surprise to the members of this committee that Canada's energy has traditionally flowed south. In fact, 99% of our crude oil and all of our natural gas exports are sent to the United States, a sole customer. However, the United States is now finding its own wealth of oil and gas reserves and in future will be less reliant on importing oil from Canada and elsewhere.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353216"> The International Energy Agency predicts that the U.S. will become the world's largest oil producer by 2020. That is why Canada must build and expand the infrastructure needed to move our product to tidewater for export to other countries as well.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3353217">Therefore, Canada is looking to build infrastructure to move energy both west and east as well as south. Right now there are four major proposed oil pipeline projects in Canada, two to connect Alberta's oil to the west coast and overseas markets, the other two to use existing infrastructure to link western production with markets in eastern Canada. We know pipelines are a safe and efficient way to transport crude to world markets. This is why it is vital that we continue to develop our pipeline capacity in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353218">Our government strongly supports the opportunity for our refineries to process substantially more Canadian oil, generating jobs for Canadians and making our country less reliant on expensive foreign oil. Diversifying our markets will give Canada access to global markets and prices for Canadian crude oil and petroleum products. Currently, Canada is forced to sell its crude at a considerable discount. In February, this was as much as $30 U.S. a barrel below global prices. Today, the gap has closed significantly to just under $10 a barrel.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353219">Differentials change quickly and reflect market forces, such as increasing production, adjusted transmission, infrastructure and difficulties accessing appropriate refineries. Producers, provincial governments and the Government of Canada all suffer as a result of elevated differentials, as do portions of the Canadian public via losses of jobs and reduced investment returns.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="55">(2155)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3353220">It is estimated that the Province of Alberta alone, loses, or leaves on the table, billions, up to $5 billion to $8 billion, a year in royalties alone on the price differential. Narrowing that price gap will ensure that Canadian producers can obtain the best possible price for their crude and ensure that Canadians realize the maximum benefit of this great resource.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353221">Canada is also targeting new global opportunities for liquefied natural gas. Our recoverable resources are currently estimated at as much as 1,300 trillion cubic feet, as I said earlier, a number that will grow significantly as offshore development continues and new shale deposits are discovered. The Conference Board of Canada estimates that B.C.'s natural gas sector could attract more than $180 billion in investment between 2012 and 2035, an average of more than $7.5 billion in new investment each year. On the west coast, the first of a number of proposed LNG projects could be in operation as early as 2015. Based on potential and proposed projects, Canada could be exporting the equivalent of 75 million tons of liquefied natural gas per year from the west coast, with project startups expected before the decade is out.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3353222">Japan, South Korea and China have all expressed interest in LNG from Canada's west coast, and they are active participants in current Canadian LNG export proposals. Partners in one of the proposed LNG projects, for example, include Korea Gas Corporation, PetroChina Company Limited, and Japan's Mitsubishi Corporation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353223">India is now expressing interest in LNG exports from Canada's east coast. That is a logical step, since Canada's Atlantic provinces are closer to the west coast of India than any other place in North America. Our overall goal is to make Canada the platform for North American liquefied natural gas exports.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353224"> Canada is also aggressively pursuing agreements that will allow Canadian businesses to compete in some of the world's fastest growing economies. We know that between 2010 and 2035, the International Energy Agency predicts that global energy demand may grow by up to 35%. In this scenario, China, India and the Middle East will account for a staggering 60% of this increase in world demand. Already India is facing an electricity shortfall of about 8%, with peak shortages of more than 10% in 2011 and 2012. To meet its growing needs, India aims to more than triple its electricity supply within the next 25 years.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3353225">That is why our government was delighted that last month Canada and India took the important step toward full implementation of a nuclear co-operation agreement. Once the agreement is finalized, Canadian companies will be able to export controlled nuclear materials, equipment and technology to India for peaceful energy-producing purposes. When we consider that India's nuclear energy output is expected to more than double by 2020, Canada stands to gain a large portion of that growing nuclear energy market.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353226"> Canada has a diversified energy mix, one that can help drive the national economy and build global energy security.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353227">As an Alberta MP, something that is near and dear to me is the expansion and diversification of our energy markets. It is absolutely critical for not only my province but of course the entire country. It is a top priority for the Government of Canada.

It is 10:30 p.m. here in Ottawa but it is only 7:30 back in Yukon so I hold out hope that a number of my constituents will be tuning in to watch this and it will not just be my mother. All of them will be watching, not just my mom.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353307">I am pleased to participate in this committee of the whole debate and would like to start my comments specifically with our government's most recent budget, economic action plan 2013. </ParaText><ParaText id="3353308">Canada has a well-earned reputation for excellence in economic and financial management and we intend to return to balanced budgets by 2015. Economic action plan 2013 builds on our economic record by taking concrete steps to position Canada for success in the 21st century global economy. Specifically, it would help Canadians obtain the skills and qualifications they need to get jobs in high demand fields; it would help manufacturers and businesses succeed in the global economy by enhancing the conditions for creating and growing business; it introduces a new building Canada plan that would lead to better roads, bridges and public transit in cities and communities all across our great nation; and it would invest in world-class research and innovation to help ensure that new ideas are developed and transferred from the lab to the marketplace.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3353309">Of course our nation does have challenges to welcome. Despite the fact that Canadian workers are among the highest educated and the best trained in the world, Canada is facing shortages of skilled labour for the coming years. For example, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce has identified Canada's skill shortages as the number one issue facing its membership. Canada's resource industries are also facing the same problem with skilled labour and trades.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353310">To help address these issues, economic action plan 2013 sets out a practical three-point plan. </ParaText><ParaText id="3353311">First, to ensure that Canadians are acquiring the skills that employers are seeking, the plan introduces the new Canada jobs grant that would provide $15,000 more per person, including a maximum federal contribution of $5,000 to be matched by provincial and territorial governments and employers. Just this past week I was pleased to host an open house consultation in my riding to speak about the jobs grant and how employers and governments can partner and shape this plan into our future so that it works to meet the needs of industry in those skill shortages.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353312">Second, the plan would create opportunities for apprentices by working with the provinces and territories and by introducing measures that would support the use of apprentices through federal construction and maintenance contracts.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353313">Finally, economic action plan 2013 would provide support to groups that are under-represented in the job market, such as persons with disabilities, youth, aboriginal peoples and newcomers to our country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3353314">These groups were well represented during the consultations that took place in Yukon. They had valuable input and feedback that we are looking forward to receiving and reviewing as we move forward.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353315">Members of the House well know that Canada's abundant natural resources are pillars of our economic strength. When we take the direct and indirect impact into account, the natural resource sector represents about 20% of Canada's GDP and employs 1.6 million Canadians. The resource sector also pays more than $30 billion per year to government coffers through taxes and royalties, which helps pay for health care, education, pensions and other critical social programs. </ParaText><ParaText id="3353316">In the case of the energy sector, many analysts say that it has become the new engine of Canada's economy. The oil sands alone are responsible for some 275,000 direct and indirect jobs in skilled trades, manufacturing, high technology and financial services in every single region of Canada. According to the Canadian Energy Research Institute, projected increases in oil sands production could support close to 630,000 jobs on average between now and 2035. The institute also forecasts that the oil sands could contribute more than $2.8 trillion to Canada's GDP, an annual average of $113 billion during that same period.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3353317">This is great news for all Canadian workers and their families, but while our resources are great and many, unless we can ensure that they will reach foreign markets and obtain world prices, we will not meet our full potential as a nation.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="25">(2225)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3353318">Those who think that pipelines are an Alberta issue should think again. Getting pipelines built west, south and east to send our oil and natural gas to the United States, to Asia and to other world markets is a national priority for this government. Few countries are generating natural resource products on the scale or pace of Canada. As many as 600 major resource projects worth more than $650 billion are under way or planned over the next decade, with the potential to create enormous prosperity for Canada, realizing the potential of our natural resources industries is critical to our government's goals of jobs, growth and long-term prosperity. That is why our government is so focused on creating the right conditions for success.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353319">Through our plan for responsible resource development, we have set firm beginning to end timelines for project reviews. We are also eliminating duplication in the review process where provincial reviews meet our stringent environmental standards.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353320"> In Yukon, natural resources development projects have seen the benefit of regulatory reform through devolution. The 2003 Yukon Northern Affairs program devolution agreement brought management and the administration of all the lands and resources under the control of the government of the Yukon. The Hon. Michael Miltenberger referred to Yukon as a prime example of how timelines and the responsiveness of project reviews improved because of this important regulatory reform. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3353321">In addition, the former president of the Yukon Chamber of Commerce, Sandy Babcock, had reported to the Natural Resources committee that Yukon's cap of $3 million in resource revenue sharing needed to be increased so the territorial government received a greater share of its resource royalties.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353322"> The Government of Canada listened. Last summer, during the northern tour, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> announced a new resource revenue sharing agreement, doubling the cap to $6 million. Recently, the premier of Yukon, Darrell Pasloski, outlined that this made for an additional sharing of $2.7 million to the territory. </ParaText><ParaText id="3353323">However, our plan is not just about developing resources efficiently; it is about developing them responsibly. Our government is committed to developing our natural resources in a responsible way, which includes strengthening environmental protection. We reject the notion that we cannot do both at the same time. Through our actions, including tough new fines for companies that break our environmental laws and new measures to ensure world-class pipeline and marine safety regimes, we are proving we can.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3353324"> Our government is also making every effort to ensure that aboriginal people and first nations people can share in the tremendous benefits that natural resources development offers in the years ahead. Earlier this month, Natural Resources Canada funded $500,000 to a consortium led by the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations to pursue the study of a potential power generation plant fed by biomass in Haines Junction. This project was included among 56 new innovative clean energy projects announced by the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, representing an investment of $86 million through the Government of Canada's eco-energy innovation initiative. This program was created to invest in new clean energy technologies that would create jobs, generate economic opportunities and help protect the environment.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353325"> I was certainly pleased to be in Yukon to make that very important funding announcement and I can assure members that it was exceptionally well received by the people of the territory and the first nation of the Champagne and Aishihik in that community.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3353326">The significance of the resource sector's economic impact cannot be understated. In 2012, 32,000 aboriginal people, or 8.3% of the working aboriginal population, were employed in the natural resources industries of forestry, energy and mining. Aboriginal people make up 7.5% of the workforce in Canada's mining sector.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353327"> However, the minerals and metal sector is not the only sector offering opportunities for aboriginal people. Ten per cent of the oil sands workforce is aboriginal. Many aboriginal companies are also thriving in Alberta's oil patch. The Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business estimates that oil sand companies do $1.3 billion worth of business each year, with a wide range of aboriginal companies, including parts suppliers, mechanical contractors and camp caterers.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353328"> Given the scope of aboriginal business activities and employment, the council has named the oil sands as the largest single non-governmental source of aboriginal income in Canada. This degree of participation in Canada's resource economy is a substantial achievement and one that our government wishes to expand on across the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353329"> To that end, we are committed to working in concert with aboriginal communities to ensure they continue to share the rewards of natural resources development in Canada.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="30">(2230)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3353330">The committee on natural resources recommended this past year that the Government of Canada increase its support to mining training initiatives for first nation and Inuit communities in order to help develop the labour force required to support mining projects in northern Canada. Their contributions are vital to the mining sector, and these recommendations seek to further their impact. As members know, economic growth, job creation and prosperity for all Canadians is our government's top priority.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353331">In conclusion, our government has designed and implemented policies aimed at driving the economy to its full potential for the benefit of all Canadians. Together the initiatives in economic action plan 2013 build on previous government actions to reinforce the fundamental strengths of the Canadian economy. By staying the course, the Government of Canada will continue to promote economic growth, job creation and long-term prosperity for all Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353332">I would now like to ask the minister, along the vein of much of my discussion today, about the benefits for aboriginal and first nation communities in resource development, specifically in my riding of Yukon. Because we know that northerners, including our aboriginal people, first nations and Inuit, are an integral part of resource development in the north, I would like to ask what our government is doing to ensure that they are able to benefit from the opportunities that resource development provides.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Most of this development is located on or near aboriginal communities, and much of it is located in northern Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353336">To further enable aboriginal peoples to take advantage of these opportunities, budget 2013 would provide over $600 million to support aboriginal education, skills development and community infrastructure.

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Crockatt" id="8025112"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="190570" Type="2">Ms. Joan Crockatt (Calgary Centre, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3353400">Mr. Chair, it is a real honour to be able to participate in this critical debate tonight. I will be using ten minutes to speak, leaving five minutes for questions at the end.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353401">Today I would like to focus on market diversification and the hurdles we need to surmount as Canadians in order to put our natural resources to the highest and best use for the benefit of the entire country. Our government is working hard to pursue the responsible development of our resources, hand in hand with protecting our environment. I will explain more about that in a minute.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353402">First, to set the scene, the problem that Canadians face is that we are currently selling our resources too cheaply. In fact, last year alone we lost $6 billion in my home province of Alberta. According to CIBC, we stand to lose $27 billion in federal and provincial taxes and royalties every year, not to mention lost jobs in every single province in Canada, because of the lack of access to international markets.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3353403">That is $50 million every day, and that $50 million is a loss for every child and every grandchild, and every woman and man in Canada, because our resources are landlocked. That money could be going right now to pay for schools and hospitals, roads and bridges and child care. Instead, Canadians are subsidizing schools and hospitals, roads and bridges and child care in the United States, while they pay us $20 billion to $30 billion below the world price for oil.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353404">There are proposals to build pipelines, as we have heard, to the south, the west, the east and to the north coast of Canada to tidewater, where we will have international market access. I would like to applaud those who are showing leadership in this regard. </ParaText><ParaText id="3353405">Firstly, I would like to applaud British Columbians. We can all celebrate the decision by British Columbians, who in last week's election realized that natural resource development is the key to their future. British Columbians showed us that when people get the facts they make the right decision.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353406">The Northwest Territories government has added a healthy sense of competition by opening the door to a pipeline to the north. The Metis Settlements General Council has just signed an agreement with the Alberta government so that they can develop natural resources in their province. Additionally, aboriginals in several other provinces have signed agreements to benefit from jobs and investment.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3353407">Quebec premier Pauline Marois said she would welcome a pipeline extension to the east, to allow Quebec refineries like Suncor and Ultramar to stay competitive, with better access to Canadian oil supplies where other Quebec refineries have closed. </ParaText><ParaText id="3353408">Many union voices are joining this chorus. At committee in the last few weeks, we have heard definitive testimony from the Canadian energy and paperworkers in Montreal and the AFL-CIO in central and eastern Canada. Just today, the united association of journeymen and apprentices said that pipelines, such as line 9 from Sarnia to Montreal and the proposed west-east pipeline to St. John, will keep refineries competitive in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick, and will provide new, well-paying jobs. They want our federal government to enable industry to create those jobs and to provide stability into the future.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353409">Quebec's top import in 2012 was crude oil. The lack of a pipeline from west to east meant that Quebeckers were paying a higher world oil price to import the highest percentage of their oil from, guess where, Algeria. That is right. A recent CERI survey showed that a majority of Quebecers said they would rather be buying their oil from Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353410">New Brunswick Premier David Alward is throwing out the welcome mat to bring Albertan and Saskatchewan oil to his province, where Canada has its largest refinery along with a deepwater port to provide ready access to world markets. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3353411">What is more is that there is a new urgency to do this, since world supply has shifted dramatically in recent months. Suddenly Canada's oil suppliers are bottlenecked by a lack of pipelines and the world is seeing vast quantities of shale gas and oil being discovered daily. These are going to compete with us for the world markets that we could be serving. India, China, Africa, Latin America and the United States all have found abundant supplies of non-conventional gas and oil.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="55">(2255)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3353412">The early bird will get the worm. However, the Liberals and the NDP, shockingly including the NDP's only Alberta member from Edmonton—Strathcona who is working against her province's primary industry, are opposing our access to international markets and putting Canada at risk of being left out in the cold.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353413">Many of our competitors can develop their resources in a far less environmentally sound manner than Canada. Last year, China's growth more than ate up all of the GHG emission reductions of Canada and the U.S. Dr. Jack Mintz recently reported that in the <I>National Post</I>. The planet will suffer and China's citizens, not ours, will reap the economic benefits, while we literally run the risk of missing the boat to China and losing out on billions in revenue that could be in the pockets of Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353414">However, all is not lost. I talked earlier about British Columbians showing us that when intelligent people get the facts they make the right decision. What are the facts?</ParaText><ParaText id="3353415">Canadians justifiably want to be assured that the environment and the economy can work together to benefit us all and enhance our quality of life. Let me tell the House what is being done in the area of resource development to protect our environment for future generations.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3353416">Industry is dramatically reducing its water usage in the oil sands. It used to take eight barrels of water to produce a barrel of oil and that ratio has been cut in half to four. Water is now recycled four times on average and in some cases six times, a world-leading benchmark.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353417">Greenhouse gas emissions from the oil sands have dropped 25% per barrel of oil produced with our government's strong guidance. Just two weeks ago, we saw a significant leap forward in technological advancement. Imperial Oil began production from its Kearl oil sands plant near Fort McMurray, the first plant to produce a barrel of oil with a comparable greenhouse gas emission level to an average refinery in the U.S. A study by the Colorado-based industry analysis firm IHS shows Kearl will produce a barrel of oil at a life cycle GHG emission level below that of California heavy oil.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353418">That should be a game changer for people, busting the myth of the anti-jobs, no development party over there and the notion of the oil sands being dirty when in fact the oil sands can produce with the same GHGs as conventional oil. Kearl is the first plant to reach that mark, but it clearly shows the groundbreaking environmental benchmarks that Canadian companies are reaching through high-tech advances.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3353419">Canada has also spawned world-leading green tech companies leading the charge for sustainable energy development and environmental responsibility. Tervita Corporation in my own riding of Calgary Centre is just one example. Tailings ponds used to take 17 years to be reclaimed. Now that time is down to two to five years and in some cases just months.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353420"> CTV <I>Power Play</I>'s Don Martin even announced last week that the oil sands had cleaned up their act tremendously. In fact, it is worth telling Canadians that only 5 of the 101 projects under way in the oil sands in 2012 were mines. The rest were underground in situ projects. Therefore, members can see why we talk about the myths being perpetuated by the opposition.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353421">Our government has also doubled pipeline inspections in the recent budget and put in place mandatory guidelines for double-hulled tankers that are piloted through our waters to ensure that Canada keeps its over 99.9996% pipeline safety record.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353422">Unfortunately, the NDP members voted against all these measures. They might be asking themselves why B.C. rejected the NDP.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353423"> Our knowledgeable and competent natural resources minister has noted that, compared to other countries, we meet or exceed the very best safety records and world-class standards for environmental care. We have toughened our strong penalties for violators, which include the polluter-pay principle.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3353424">While the opposition over there huffs and puffs and belches black smoke about our energy industry, scaremongers both at home and in Washington and strives to halt development, the Conservatives know that the industry can and is co-existing very happily with the environment.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="00">(2300)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3353425">We are not finished yet, but Canada has already achieved half the GHG reduction levels to meet its Copenhagen targets by 2020, and this is in stark contrast with the Liberals, as greenhouse gas levels rose 30% under their watch.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353426">Finally, I will leave everyone with the environmental moral cause for shipping oil and gas westward from Canada to China. The School of Public Policy's Jack Mintz, Maria van der Hoeven of the International Energy Agency and Dr. Wenran Jiang of the Asia Pacific Foundation all point out Canada is uniquely positioned to assist China in getting off its dependence on coal-fired power by supplying it with clean fossil fuels like oil and liquefied natural gas.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353427">Mr. Chair, thank you for allowing me to break down some of the myths surrounding development of Canada's miraculous natural resources. Facts surmount fear every time.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353428">Two weeks ago, I had the opportunity to attend with the hon. <Affiliation DbId="139897" Type="4">Minister of State for Science and Technology</Affiliation> the launch of the Algal carbon conversion pilot project to be built near Cold Lake, Alberta by Pond Biofuels and CNRL, an oil sands leader. This pilot will not only reduce the carbon emissions of CNRL's oil sands operation in Primrose by 15% to 30%, it is actually going to turn carbon dioxide into a safe, marketable biomass. Bringing this idea to market will benefit all Canadians.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3353429">I bring this up because it is one of the newest examples of how Canadian industry, with the strongest encouragement and new regulations put in place by our government, is bridging technology gaps to produce our natural resources more cleanly. It is one of the examples of the interests of energy and the environment merging, growing Canada's economy and benefiting all Canadians, breaking the myths being perpetuated by the opposition.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353430">With this in mind, I would like to ask the parliamentary secretary what our government is doing to further encourage the decrease in emissions from natural resources development.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

For example, $590 million in funding has gone toward Sustainable Development Technology Canada, which has leveraged a $1.6-billion investment. That is a ratio of $3 of investment for every $1 that has been contributed by taxpayers.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353432">Economic action plan 2013 allocates $325 million over eight years in funding for SDTC and that signals our continuing commitment to energy and environmental innovation. The new funding means that the government's total investment in the SDTC tech fund is $950 million to date. Eco-energy innovation is investing $268 million over five years for clean energy demonstration and research and development projects. This will include investments in smart grid and renewable energy in carbon capture and storage in energy-efficient buildings and environmental aspects of oil sands.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353433">The eco-energy for biofuels program will make a total investment of over $1 billion by 2017 to encourage the expansion of the domestic biofuels industry.

It has been great. We want to thank he minister for sharing his evening with us in such an effective way. </ParaText><ParaText id="3353495">I also would like to acknowledge Mr. Dupont and Mr. Arora for the time that they have spent here tonight and the expertise that they bring on this file as well, and I know there are other people who have worked hard to present the natural resources case for this country.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353496">I also want to acknowledge my colleagues who have spent the evening here with us. Most of them have spoken and have spoken extremely well. I think of the chair of the natural resources committee; the member for <Affiliation DbId="170662" Type="2">Vegreville—Wainwright</Affiliation>; my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170562" Type="2">Tobique—Mactaquac</Affiliation>; my friend from <Affiliation DbId="170646" Type="2">Wetaskiwin</Affiliation>, who spoke a bit earlier; the member for <Affiliation DbId="170561" Type="2">Saskatoon—Humboldt</Affiliation>; the member for <Affiliation DbId="170598" Type="2">Yukon</Affiliation>, who even sent a “hi” out to his mother there; and the member for <Affiliation DbId="190570" Type="2">Calgary Centre</Affiliation>, who spoke so effectively. </ParaText><ParaText id="3353497">I also want to acknowledge the member for <Affiliation DbId="170549" Type="2">Blackstrap</Affiliation>, who has been here with us all night tonight because resources are important to Saskatchewan. She is an important member of the cabinet and an important member from Saskatchewan. It is great that she was able to be with us as well.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3353498">We have been talking about numbers all night tonight, and there are some numbers that I find a bit disquieting and intriguing. We have talked about the 630,000 jobs that are projected to be created by the oil sands over the next 25 years and the hundreds of thousands of other jobs that are going to be created by the resources sector across this country. Unfortunately, again tonight it seems that we have heard the New Democrats say one more time that they want to say no to those jobs.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353499"> It bothers me, when I come from a resource-based province, to hear that kind of thing. As I mentioned earlier, it seems that they oppose everything about natural resources. We heard the member for <Affiliation DbId="170183" Type="2">Edmonton—Strathcona</Affiliation>, from Alberta, the province where the oil sands are so important, who came in here and opposed oil sands. We heard my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="190570" Type="2">Calgary Centre</Affiliation> talk about the Kearl project and how those greenhouse gas emissions now are similar to what is being produced from regular oil production. Certainly the opposition members should be welcoming that news, but they do not seem to be willing to do so.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3353500">We have heard in the past how they have opposed offshore. They do not like offshore and the development of offshore. We hear how they do not like pipelines. Some of them do not like pipelines and some of them seem to. They keep changing their position. I had to appreciate my colleague this afternoon in what seemed to be grudging support for the west-to-east pipeline, although last week his leader changed his own position on that, so we wish them luck in trying to convince their leader that he actually needs to represent all of Canada and just not small interest groups in particular areas across this country.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353501">We are concerned, as I read in a quote a bit earlier, that the NDP opposes all things nuclear. The New Democrats' leader was straightforward about that here in the House. He said that they are just going to oppose it. I can hear my colleague across the way saying that they of course oppose that, that they certainly do oppose that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353502">There is shale gas, the latest and greatest development around the world that is going to change the way energy is produced and used on this globe, and the New Democrats again come up dead against it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3353503"> We also see their opposition in so many ways to mining across this country. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170598" Type="2">Yukon</Affiliation> and other colleagues from the north are particularly concerned about their opposition up there as they try to develop their economies and begin to get some of the same advantages that the rest of us have. </ParaText><ParaText id="3353504"> It was interesting to hear about the impact that the development of natural resources will have on our aboriginal communities. Those of us from the west, and particularly from Saskatchewan, know that we need to get our young aboriginal people involved in the economy and that probably the quickest and best way to do that is through the resource sector. It pains me to have to ask again why the New Democrats stand so strongly against that when it is so important in so much of our country.</ParaText><ParaText id="3353505">At the natural resources committee today we were excited to hear from some folks from Montreal who were talking about the importance of the west-to-east pipeline and the re-reversal of that pipeline so that it can create opportunities in Quebec and further east, as far east as my colleague from New Brunswick. He looks forward to having some of those opportunities as well.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3353506">I wanted to talk about the New Democrats' great commitment to the carbon tax and the $20 billion that it would take out of Canadians' pockets. We have not mentioned much about that tonight, and they certainly do not want to bring it up anymore. </ParaText><ParaText id="3353507">However, we look forward to continuing to be the government in this country, continuing to develop resources across this country, continuing under the great leadership of the <Affiliation DbId="170686" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation>, and being able to do that in spite of what the New Democrats want to do to our resource communities, our resource jobs and so much of our resource-based economy.</ParaText>
