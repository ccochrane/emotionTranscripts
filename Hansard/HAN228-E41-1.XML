					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Chisholm" id="7944551"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170644" Type="2">Mr. Robert Chisholm (Dartmouth—Cole Harbour, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3249584">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak to this important issue. I want to thank my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170284" Type="2">New Westminster—Coquitlam</Affiliation>, for bringing this important issue to the attention of members of the House. Frankly, tens of thousands of Canadians have responded in an incredibly positive manner by agreeing with him and many members of the House that the finning of sharks at sea is an intolerable practice that needs to stop.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249585">I talked at some length in my earlier comments about how approximately 100 million sharks are being killed each year primarily for their fins, shrinking the international shark population and resulting in the near extinction of dozens of species. The last time I was on my feet I spoke about the porbeagle shark, which has subsequently been listed as an extinct species. It is found off the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia. The problem with that species is primarily the damage that is done as a bycatch. However, there is still a small directed fishery, and there was some attempt made at an international conference last fall to try to get Canada to recognize that it was another species nearing extinction and controls were required to be put on the fishing effort. Unfortunately, at that time Canada decided not to act, though there have subsequently been some efforts in this regard.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249586">There has been a fair bit of polling done of the general population of Canada, and I believe over 80% of Canadians are opposed to this practice and would support a ban. Likewise, the majority of the Asian community also support the measures proposed by this bill. The question that needs to be asked and that is being posed by the member who sponsored this private member's bill is this. Why do we not show some leadership on this important issue, move forward, take action, and respond not only to the international nature of this problem but recognize the will of the Canadian population by proceeding with a ban?</ParaText><ParaText id="3249587">Several municipalities have done that. It is not without its controversy, but New Democrats believe that it is time to act because it is the right thing to do. Surely, members in the House can agree to act on the basis that it is the right thing to do.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Sopuck" id="7944554"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170623" Type="2">Mr. Robert Sopuck (Dauphin—Swan River—Marquette, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3249588">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to speak to this bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249589"> I do not doubt the sincerity of the member for <Affiliation DbId="170644" Type="2">Dartmouth—Cole Harbour</Affiliation> or the member for <Affiliation DbId="170284" Type="2">New Westminster—Coquitlam</Affiliation> for a minute. I have the honour of serving on the fisheries committee with them, and their dedication to fisheries conservation is well known.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249590">I would like to start by making it very clear that the practice of shark finning, defined in this bill as the practice of removing the fins from sharks and discarding the remainder of the sharks while at sea, is a deplorable activity. There are up to 100 million sharks a year that are killed, mostly for their fins, according to the UNFAO.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249591">I think I can say that from past discussions among representatives of all parties in the House, there is agreement that sharks play a critical role in our ocean ecosystem and the practice of shark finning as defined above is abhorrent.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249592">In 2007, Canada released its national plan of action for the conservation and management of sharks in response to international calls on states to do so within the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Three shark species are listed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora: the whale shark, the great white shark and the basking shark. As a party to this agreement, often known as CITES, Canada takes seriously its obligation to prevent the import of products made from listed species. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249593">This having been said, it is important to make the distinction between shark finning and shark fishing. The practice of shark finning is already prohibited in Canada and has been so since 1994. On the other hand, shark fishing does occur in Canada and has been occurring in Canada for over 80 years in many areas. Canada's shark fisheries are clearly sustainable and based on sound scientific advice. In fact, the Pacific spiny dogfish fishery recently became the first shark fishery to be certified as sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council, a testament to the efficacy of the controls placed on that fishery by DFO.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249594">We have controls in place to manage shark fishing, just as we have controls in place for all commercial fisheries. These controls fulfill the government's duty to manage Canada's sea coast and inland fisheries on behalf of all of us.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249595">In case anybody is tempted to ask, I will digress and talk a little about the budget that just came forward. We were very pleased to see that a new program is beginning for the conservation of fisheries through community partnerships. That is a testament to the government's action on behalf of fisheries conservation. Again, the dedication of the entire Pacific salmon stamp to Pacific salmon conservation is another milestone in Canadian fisheries conservation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249596">With regard to sharks, all licence holders for Canadian shark fisheries and for fisheries where sharks are landed as bycatch are subject to licence conditions that prohibit them from engaging in shark finning. For example, licence conditions, pursuant to subsection 22(1) of the fishery general regulations, are attached to porbeagle shark licences. Conditions clearly state that while fishing under the authority of these licence conditions, “Finning (the practice of removing only the fins from the sharks and discarding the remainder of the shark at sea) is strictly prohibited”.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249597">Canadian fishermen can also sustainably harvest sharks on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts through directed fishing conditions for spiny dogfish and allowed bycatch of blue, shortfin mako and porbeagle sharks. However, annual landings of these sharks are very small.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249598">Further, if the licence holder removes fins from any sharks that he or she has retained, the weight of the fin so removed cannot exceed 5% of the weight of the corresponding dressed shark carcasses that have been retained. In other words, a licence holder who has legally caught a shark can remove the fin of the shark as part of the normal dressing of a fish. Finally, to ensure compliance, all shark fins and carcasses must be unloaded at the same time. These measures are specifically to ensure that shark finning is not taking place.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249599">Fisheries and Oceans Canada is also responsible for setting the quotas and for enforcing licence conditions that ensure sustainability. As mentioned earlier, shark fins cannot make up more than 5% of the overall weight of a shark that is on board a Canadian fishing vessel. In order to enforce this, all landings are subject to 100% monitoring by dockside observers to ensure compliance. Non-compliance with a licence condition constitutes an offence under the Fisheries Act, as enforced by Fisheries and Oceans Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249600"> The Canadian Food Inspection Agency, CFIA, is the federal department dedicated to safeguarding food, animals and plants, which enhances the health and well-being of Canada's people, environment and economy. CFIA regulates the import of food products, such as shark fins. CFIA is already exploring what can be done on the importation of shark fins. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3249601">Shark products for human consumption fall under regulations that address the importation of fish and seafood products. These regulations set standards for quality, safety, identification and are enforced by CFIA. It is not illegal to sell shark fins in Canada, and banning the use of shark fins would damage legitimate sustainable fisheries that supply fins but also other shark products. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249602">The Department of Fisheries and Oceans promotes the full utilization of sharks. I would note that shark fins are a specialty food product and a treasured food resource for many of Canada's communities. The fact remains that shark fishing is a legitimate fishery and its products are found in numerous places. Shark meat is available in restaurants and supermarkets under many names: fish strips, stockfish, and rock salmon. It is also in fish and chips or imitation crab meat. This is probably more than anybody ever wanted to know about sharks.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249603">In the health sector, shark cartilage powder is marketed as a healthy food supplement. Shark liver oil is rich in vitamin A and is frequently an ingredient in every child's favourite food, cod liver oil. Some even market shark cartilage as an anti-cancer medicine, though evidence is still being sought in this regard.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249604">Shark products are found in dog food, fish meal and even in fertilizers. Some people may even have shark skin wallets or boots. Collagen from shark cartilage is used in creams and other collagen preparations, and it is even considered kosher.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249605">The Convention on International Trade and Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, CITES, at its triennial conference in Bangkok, on March 3 to 14 of this year, took decisive action for the protection of a wide range of other plants and animals in order to improve the world's wildlife trade. At this meeting, Canada fully supported the decision to include protection for five commercially valuable shark species: the oceanic whitetip, the scalloped hammerhead, the great hammerhead shark, the smooth hammerhead shark and the porbeagle shark, which are harvested in significant numbers for their valuable fins. This decision means that they can only be traded with CITES permits, and evidence will have to be provided that they are harvested sustainably and legally. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249606">In fact, the only criteria for fisheries management should be the sustainability of the fisheries resource, not polls. The regulations governing the trade of these products will come into effect in 2014. These new listings join those for three species already under CITES protection: the great white shark, the whale shark and basking shark.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249607"> I would like to quote the CITES Secretary-General, John E. Scanlon, who said:</ParaText><ParaText id="3249608"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">This is a big day for CITES and for the world's wildlife. It takes enormous effort to negotiate treaties and then make them work. The international community has today decided to make best use of this pragmatic and effective agreement to help it along the path to sustainability in our oceans and forests.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249609">Requiring CITES export permits will ensure that international markets are supplied by fish from sustainably managed fisheries and, again, sustainability should be the only criteria.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249610">What has happened as well, given the CITES agreements, is that China, one of the world's biggest markets for shark fins, is already seeing the impact of the world campaign. Shark fin imports to China dropped off dramatically last year, to 3,351 tonnes, from 10,340 tonnes in 2011.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249611">Canada believes that working through regional fisheries management organizations to ensure strong management and enforcement practices globally is the most effective way to prevent unsustainable shark fishing practices. A complete trade ban would penalize responsible and legitimate fishing practices.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249612">Bill <Document DbId="5227380" Type="4">C-380</Document> can be seen as interference in the legitimate natural resource management policies of other countries. We must be very careful here. Canada has become a target of ill thought out and disgraceful campaigns by international activist organizations for what are very sustainable natural resource industries. We can look at the seal hunt, forestry and of course the oil sands. Bill C-380 sets a very bad precedent, is overly broad and could unfairly target sustainable fisheries around the world, just as many rural Canadian communities have been unfairly targeted even when science shows their resource use is sustainable and managed well.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249613">There is a role for Canada to promote responsible resource management in international waters and fisheries, but we must ensure we follow the appropriate international channels and do not act unilaterally.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249614">Mr. Speaker, as you can see, actions have been taken domestically and internationally to end the practice of shark finning, and they are effective. The measures in Bill <Document DbId="5227380" Type="4">C-380</Document> do not add anything further to our current efforts, and that is why we will not be supporting the bill. </ParaText>

					<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Lamoureux" id="7944568"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170750" Type="2">Mr. Kevin Lamoureux (Winnipeg North, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3249615">Mr. Speaker, let me be clear. The whole idea of shark finning is cruel and inhumane. It has a very strong negative impact on the shark population in our oceans around the world. To the degree to which it threatens to put some species of shark into extinction, there is no justification whatsoever for shark finning. At the end of the day, I believe this is an issue that has been around for a number of years. In fact, we could go back to 1994, when Jean Chrétien, the former prime minister of Canada, introduced a ban in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249616"> The bill, if amended, could have some potential to reinforce what we believe a good number of Canadians believe, and that is that shark finning is completely unacceptable in circumstances where the shark carcasses are thrown back into our oceans after their fins are removed. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249617">Most Canadians would experience this by watching shows and news broadcasts. We see majestic documentaries that clearly show the role sharks have played in our oceans around the world, not only today, but for hundreds of thousands of years. Then we see the news broadcasts that paint a very ugly picture. They show how shark finning takes place on all of our oceans. They show where a shark is hauled from the ocean into a boat, is quickly de-finned and then thrown back into the water, where it is left to drown and the body left to decompose.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249618">Many Canadians have seen these practices, whether on YouTube or in documentaries, and this has influenced their opinions on the issue. I believe that, generally speaking, shark finning is seen in a very negative light, as it should be. I suspect that there are very few Canadians who would support that type of shark finning, where the carcass is left to decompose.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249619">Having said that, I want to highlight the fact that this is as an issue that has been around for a long time. The Liberal Party has taken, I believe, a responsible approach with respect to this issue. In 1994, we brought in legislation to ban shark finning outright, in terms of our own fisheries.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249620">Many other countries have followed Canada's lead in terms of banning shark finning. We applaud those countries that have seen the value in doing what Canada has done. Sadly, there are still many countries that do not see this for what it is, the inhumane treatment of a shark, and they continue to allow shark finning to occur. There are many businesses and entrepreneurs that continue to practise this disgusting measure. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249621">We are right to do what we can to send the right messages and pass the right laws in order to prevent illegal shark finning from taking place. To that extent, we believe that having the bill sent to committee would be a positive thing. It would be our intent to propose amendments in committee in order to make the legislation more acceptable. As it stands today, it is not acceptable.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3249622">We need to recognize that there are two types of shark finning occurring. What is offensive is taking the fins and disposing of the carcass. Throughout the world in many countries there is legitimate shark harvesting and where that occurs those fins are properly packed and ultimately end up here in Canada. It is done legally. There are many benefits to that being allowed to continue. We need to be culturally sensitive because there are cultures here in Canada that put a great deal of value on shark fins. Therefore, the House of Commons would not be justified in putting an outright ban on them. Yet that is what the bill would do if it is not amended.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249623">While we are offended by the illegal shark finning that takes place worldwide, we also recognize both the economic and social benefits of allowing properly harvested shark fins to continue to arrive here in Canada. It is important for us to distinguish that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249624">We have seen city councils here in Canada and in many states in the United States attempt to deal with this issue by passing bylaws. In 2011 or around there, the City of Toronto attempted to ban shark finning and a court ruling overturned it. I am not sure where that case is now, but I believe that for the most part most politicians recognize the sensitivity of the issue and see the value of allowing properly harvested shark fins to come into Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249625">I am very much aware of how sometimes words can be twisted and I would caution members who might want to twist these words because I have had opportunities to talk to people of all ages on this issue, and youth in particular. It is very easy to go into a classroom and paint this picture of the brutality and the inhumane manner in which sharks are being exploited for their fins and to generate huge opposition to that. It appalls me, my constituents and Canadians when that occurs. However, that is quite different from those countries that have established laws and regulations to protect their fishing industries, including sharks, where it is done legally in a humane fashion and then packaged accordingly. We have to be very careful not to lump all as one in this situation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249626">Because it is a private member's bill, I have recommended to my caucus colleagues that we allow the bill to be sent to committee so that we can achieve the amendments that would ultimately create what a vast majority of the public wants, which is to target the illegal harvesting of shark fin that is taking place worldwide. We must hit it as hard as possible, but not penalize the social and economic considerations that need to be taken here in Canada. We have to look at the fishery industry as a whole.</ParaText>

I am not a hunter but I understand full well the practice of killing animals for food when done in a responsible way to feed people. One might say that shooting a deer in the wild could be considered more humane than putting animals through a slaughterhouse. However, being a meat eater, as most of us are, I accept all of these practices.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249630">On the other hand, killing animals for trophies or body parts is totally reprehensible. That is why I do not support the hunting of grizzlies in my province or anywhere else for that matter.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249631">I have seen the documentary <I>Sharkwater</I> and have watched how sharks are caught, their fins are cut off and they are thrown back into the water. This practice is repulsive, immoral and is largely driven by an underground market controlled by organized crime that exploits threatened and endangered species to maximize profits.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3249632">Nearly 100 million sharks are killed every year, mainly for their fins. Trade is under-regulated, and it is almost impossible to ensure that imported fins have not been removed illegally or are not from threatened species.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249633">Shark populations are slow to reproduce and cannot support the current overfishing. Sharks are essential to the health of marine ecosystems, and the decline in their population threatens to profoundly disrupt these ecosystems. In 2009, the International Union for Conservation of Nature reported that one-third of shark species were threatened with extinction because of this trade.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249634">In a few decades, shark populations in certain areas have dropped by more than 95%, and they continue to decline. According to some experts, up to 20 shark species could disappear by 2017. In addition, it is impossible to know whether imported fins come from sustainable and respectful fishing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249635">Shark fin soup currently sells for between $8 and $100 a bowl in restaurants. However, in Canada as abroad, more and more people are refusing to serve or eat this kind of soup, and many Chinese restaurants have voluntarily taken this soup off their menu, including Floata in Vancouver, one of the largest Chinese restaurants in Canada.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249636">Some municipalities in Canada have also passed, or will soon pass, bylaws prohibiting the sale of shark fins and related products. The communities in British Columbia that fall into this group are Coquitlam, Abbotsford, Duncan, Langley, the Township of Langley, Maple Ridge, Nanaimo, New Westminster, North Vancouver, Port Moody and White Rock. I congratulate the municipal councils for having the courage to pass these bylaws.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249637">The Chinese government has required that shark fin soup no longer be served at state banquets. A number of prestigious hotels have removed this type of soup from their menu. Many countries, including the Bahamas, Ecuador and Fiji, territories like French Polynesia, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, as well as the American states of California, Hawaii, Illinois, Oregon and Washington have issued similar bans.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249638">Some people say that Bill <Document DbId="5227380" Type="4">C-380</Document> will have an impact on international trade. Based on our research, that is not the case.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249639">We studied the possible consequences of an import ban in relation to the WTO obligations, and we feel that this bill complies with Canada's international trade obligations. Furthermore, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170284" Type="2">New Westminster—Coquitlam</Affiliation> is open to amendments at committee stage.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3249640">We need to get the bill to committee to address any concerns anyone has.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249641"> There are a number of myths about Canada's current shark fin import laws. Some elected members have suggested that Bill <Document DbId="5227380" Type="4">C-380</Document> is unnecessary because Canada already has enough laws and that Canada bans the trade of shark products from species protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES) or the Species at Risk Act. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249642">According to the Canadian branch of Humane Society International, this is false. Both CITES and SARA only protect three species of shark: basking sharks, whale sharks and great white sharks. In other words, out of 141 threatened or near-threatened shark species only 3 are protected by Canadian federal laws.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249643">Another myth we hear is that Canada bans or restricts the trade, possession or sale of shark products that present human health or safety concerns. This is also false. Shark fins, which continue to be legally imported into Canada contain high concentrations of a potent neurotoxin, BMAA, which scientists have linked to neurodegenerative diseases in humans such as Alzheimer's and Lou Gehrig's disease. This is not unlike, for example, the link between phenylbutazone in horsemeat and aplastic anemia in children.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249644">The third myth states that working through regional fisheries management organizations to ensure strong global management and enforcement practices is the most effective way to prevent unsustainable shark fishing practices such as finning. This is also false. As long as there is a demand for shark fins, there will be local industry pressure on governments not to prohibit the practice. This demand will also perpetuate the poaching of sharks in the waters of countries that already prohibit finning. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249645">Canada has already been identified, for example, by CSIS as a destination country for poached shark fins from Australia, even though some Australian states have some of the world's strongest shark finning laws. Eliminating the demand removes incentive for fishermen to continue finning and poaching sharks.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249646">We have a chance in the House to do something right together, to take a major step and end this disgusting practice. At a bare minimum, I strongly urge my colleagues who are here, and others who will be here later on, to support getting Bill <Document DbId="5227380" Type="4">C-380</Document> to committee where there can be a detailed study with feedback from witnesses, as is the case in a democratic process.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249647">It does not hurt, in any of these crucial issues, to have some more insurance. If we think we have good laws, let us beef them up and provide more insurance to toughen them up. We can always ease back on a law after we have toughened it up, but it is really hard to try to enforce something when we do not have the legislative background to do it. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249648">For this reason, I urge my colleagues to support Bill <Document DbId="5227380" Type="4">C-380</Document>.

As others have said, I am confident that the consensus among all parliamentarians is that shark finning is a barbaric practice. We all agree on this.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249650">The question is how to deal with the issue in an effective way. Bill <Document DbId="5227380" Type="4">C-380</Document> is not the way. Why is that? It is because the bill calls for a ban on shark finning, which is already banned in Canada for Canadian licensed vessels fishing within and beyond our territorial waters. In fact, the practice has been banned in Canada since 1994, through licence conditions under the fisheries general regulations.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249651">On the subject of import licence requirements, I am proud to stand before the House and report that our government is exploring options to identify a practical, effective and expeditious resolution to this issue. Specially, our government is exploring the option of adding additional conditions to arrangements that would require that shark fin imports be sourced from jurisdictions that, like Canada, ban the practice of shark finning. That way, we would bolster our domestic ban on this abhorrent practice by putting more teeth into our important protocols. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249652">The course of this action would both respect Canada's international trade obligations and address the issue of shark finning. Best of all, once all of the appropriate considerations had been addressed, the new import requirements would be implemented more quickly than a regulatory change. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249653">We have listened and we are taking action to address the major concerns of the proposed bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249654">What are the current regulations? Recently, the issue of shark finning has received worldwide attention, as a number of animal rights and environmental organizations have blamed it for the decline of shark populations worldwide. These groups claim that between 70 and 100 million sharks are caught worldwide just for their fins, primarily for shark fin soup. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249655">The practice of shark finning can be lucrative, yielding as much as $700 per pound for shark fins. Thanks to our government's regulations, shark fishing in Canada is governed by sustainable management plans and strong enforcement. We have strong management and enforcement regimes in place to ensure that finning does not occur in Canadian fisheries. These apply to all shark species in Canadian waters. Shark fisheries are subject to dockside monitoring, at-sea observer coverage, quota monitoring systems, electronic vessel monitoring systems and hail requirements for both the at-sea observer program and dockside monitoring program.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249656">The Fisheries Act is the cornerstone of Canada's fisheries management policy, providing broad powers to the minister for the management, conservation and protection of fish resources. These powers include the discretion to, one, issue licences or leases for fisheries or fishing; two, allocate harvests among user groups; and three, protect fish habitat and prevent pollution. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249657">Section 22 of the regulations provides the <Affiliation DbId="170675" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries and Oceans</Affiliation> the specific authority to set out targeted licence conditions for the proper management and control of fisheries and the conservation and protection of fish, including sharks. These provisions provide the minister with the authority to impose, as a licence condition, measures to eliminate shark finning. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249658">We can see that the regulations already allow the minister to impose, as a licence condition, the measure to eliminate shark finning. Therefore, the member's bill seeks to prevent something from happening in Canada that is already prohibited. Today, all licence holders for Canadian shark fisheries and for fisheries where sharks are landed as a bycatch are subject to licence conditions that prohibit them from engaging in shark finning. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249659">The ban is enforced through a number of internationally accepted methods across Canada. One approach requires that the number of fins corresponds with the number of shark carcasses landed by shark fishing vessels. Under a second and more common approach, the number of fins on shark fishing vessels cannot exceed 5% of the overall weight of carcasses on-board when it lands. Both measures are intended to ensure that sharks are not caught solely for their fins.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="40">(1140)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3249660">All licensed shark fishing vessels in Canada are subject to 100% monitoring to ensure that this ratio is respected. Any violation of a licence condition is an offence under the Fisheries Act. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249661">Penalties for those found to be in contravention of their conditions of licence range from warnings, to prosecution, to requests for court-imposed licence suspensions and quota penalties, to loss of privilege of renewal of the exploratory licence. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249662">These measures were put in place to ensure that Canada's shark fishing conforms to sustainable harvesting practices. It is a very practical approach and it has worked well. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249663">Canada's approach is an internationally accepted standard within regional fisheries management organizations. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249664">Canada has additionally worked with other countries to put an end to this practice. Our government will continue to work with our international partners to ensure sustainable management of sharks, including the prohibition of the practice of fining. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249665">Internationally, we promote the sustainable management and conservation of sharks through international organizations, including the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and regional fisheries management bodies such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249666">There are also a number of international agreements, to which Canada is a party, that govern the conservation, management and trade of certain at-risk shark species. For instance, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora protects the great white, basking and whale sharks. In early March in Bangkok the convention voted at a global wildlife conference to regulate the trade of shark species that have been threatened because their fins are used to make expensive delicacies in Asia. Delegates supported proposals to put the oceanic whitetip, hammerhead and porbeagle sharks on a list of species whose trade is closely controlled. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249667">More than two dozen species of shark are officially endangered, and more than 100 others are considered either vulnerable or near-threatened. Imports of any of these shark species or any of their parts into Canada is only permissible if accompanied by an export permit from the country of origin, which certifies that the imported shark, or products derived from it, were caught in a scientifically proven sustainable fishery.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249668">Our government has taken action against the deplorable practice of illegal shark fining. We continue to support responsible, legal shark harvesters and crack down on those who break the rules.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249669">Furthermore, to strengthen Canada's protection of sharks we are exploring the option to add additional conditions for fish and seafood imports into Canada that would require that shark fin imports be sourced from jurisdictions that, like Canada, ban the practice of shark fining.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249670">We believe that, with these measures in place, private member's bill <Document DbId="5227380" Type="4">C-380</Document> would not be required, and we will oppose it.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I thank the member for his work on this issue. I know he has been working extremely hard to move forward on this and that he has conducted extensive consultations.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249672">There seems to be a consensus regarding this bill, except on the part of the Conservatives, who have a habit of opposing sensible legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249673">Nevertheless, I rise here today in the hopes of convincing them, since there will be a vote on this next Wednesday, if I am not mistaken. I hope we will have the support of enough members of the House to pass this bill and send it to committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249674">I thought it was important for me to rise and express my support for this bill, and that of most of my NDP colleagues, at second reading here today. From what I understand, the Liberals will also be supporting it. I hope all members of that party will do so. I also hope that the Conservatives will get on board this time in order to put an end to this problem, which is affecting more and more marine ecosystems around the world. I will come back to this point a little later.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249675">To begin with, as usual, when I study a bill, I like to see for myself exactly what is in the legislation. The bill we are studying here today is very simple. It contains two important points.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249676">First of all, this bill amends the Fish Inspection Act. It prohibits the importation of shark fins not attached to the rest of the shark carcass. That detail is important. It is an important aspect of the legislation that I will explain in detail a little later. Second, the bill amends the Fisheries Act to prohibit the practice of shark finning. I support both of these very simple, sensible clauses in the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249677">The bill adds subsection 3.1(1) to section 3 of the Fish Inspection Act to prohibit the importation of fins, with some exceptions, since special permits can nevertheless be issued.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249678">In addition, the bill also adds subsection 32.1(1) to the Fisheries Act, prohibiting the practice of shark finning and defining that practice. Those are the two amendments this bill makes.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249679">Why are these measures important? Why did my colleague decide to introduce this bill today? The reason is very simple: we currently have a very serious problem with our oceans. Shark species are going extinct. In fact, approximately one-third of species are currently in danger of extinction. This is therefore a critical and urgent problem that we want Canada to help solve.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249680">I know that this bill will not eliminate the problem overnight. However, at least Canada will have sent a very clear message that we are taking measures to try to reduce this practice as much as possible because we are aware of the problem that it is currently causing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249681">The situation is critical. We must take action to protect and preserve our marine ecosystems. Sharks are at the very top of the ocean food chain, and so they play an extremely important role in the survival of the ecosystem in general, which would be greatly affected by the extinction of most species of sharks. Sharks are a vital component of the ecosystem.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249682">I would like to mention some important statistics. I think that all the members who spoke today mentioned that approximately 100 million sharks are killed every year for their fins. <Document></Document></ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3249683">If that trend continues, up to 20 shark species could be functionally extinct by 2017. Another important statistic: Canada imports an average of just over 100 tons of shark fins per year. According to a CTV news report, testing conducted in British Columbia to determine whether shark fins could easily be found in Canada and what species those fins came from showed that 76% of shark fins came from endangered species of sharks. That means that most shark fins in Canada come from endangered species.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249684">How is shark finning done? In my opinion, this is a horrible, barbaric and abominable practice. It is inhumane to do what is being done right now: fishers are setting lines that are 85 km long in the hopes of catching sharks, knowing full well that many other species will be killed by this type of fishing. The sharks are even sometimes still alive when they are brought onto the boats. The sharks' fins are simply cut off and their bodies are dumped back into the ocean. Clearly, the sharks will then die because they cannot swim without their fins. It is hard to believe.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249685">When I watched the documentary <I>Sharkwater</I> recently, I was quite surprised and disappointed to see that human beings are capable of being so disrespectful toward nature. These animals are basically being tortured. As I mentioned earlier, it is important that Canada send a clear message in this regard, and that is the spirit of this bill. Clearly, we object to this practice.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249686">Earlier, I heard a member say that this could hurt the economy, but we know full well that shark meat is eaten only on rare occasions. Shark meat is rarely eaten. Most of the time, sharks are fished simply for their fins since their meat cannot be eaten because it often contains too much mercury. It is a bit of a flawed argument to say that the industry could also produce shark meat. It is a bit of a stretch to say that this would hurt the economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249687">Communities that eat shark are changing their customs. The member for <Affiliation DbId="170410" Type="2">Brossard—La Prairie</Affiliation> gave a speech about it. He said that the majority of communities and the new generation oppose the practice. Many countries, including China, have prohibited importing shark fins. China has also imposed restrictions, because it does not want shark fin to be served at its official banquets. The Chinese government has even signalled that it does not agree with the practice, which is a threat to our ecosystems.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249688">I do not have much time left, so I would like to conclude by thanking my colleague once again and congratulating him. Today, Canada has a duty to send a message that we oppose this practice and we no longer want to be part of this trade, which is often a black market trade and even involves organized crime. This bill sends a clear message to the international community that we are taking this situation seriously, that we want to protect our ecosystems and that we want to protect the environment for future generations who will have to deal with the fallout of this practice if we do not put an immediate end to it.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249689">I encourage all of my colleagues, from all sides, to support this bill and send it to committee so that any necessary amendments can be made. I know that my colleague is open to sensible proposals. At the very least, this bill should be sent to committee.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Since the first hour of debate, an important new study has come out, authored by a group of well-respected scientists.

							<ParaText id="3249706">The shark fin trade in Canada, in which currently participates, drives the horrific practice of shark finning. Many of my colleagues have spoken to that. It drives the illegal targeting of threatened and endangered species, some of which are supposed to be protected under CITES.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249707">Earlier this year I sent each of my colleagues a DVD of the film, <I>Sharkwater</I>, which shows how, even in jurisdictions that have banned shark finning, organized crime drives a hugely profitable black market. In Canada recent DNA testing has proven that fins from endangered sharks are commonly imported into the country. In 2012 testing of 56 fins obtained in Vancouver and Richmond stores showed 76% came from threatened and endangered sharks. Similar results were obtained from a 2010 study.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249708">Canada has seen numerous municipalities move forward with local bans on the sale and trade of shark fin.

The remaining $132 million will go toward administrating the workfare scheme. Only the Conservatives would consider spending $132 million to administer a $109 million fund.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249740">Quality education and training opportunities are vital for aboriginal youth to have a better future. However, it is simply wrong to force any group of people to do any activity to receive the simple benefits that everyone else receives for nothing. This approach smells of discrimination. It was not lost on me that the Conservatives decided to introduce this policy on the United Nations' International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. The government should be ashamed of that, but I doubt it is.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249741">This proposal in the budget will not help move aboriginal youth forward and, in my opinion, it is a slap in the face to those who have hoped for some positive educational and training ideas from the government. It is mean-spirited and divisive policies like these that make it impossible to support the budget.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249742">The Conservatives were given another chance with this budget to show that they were truly committed to making our country work and prove that they were truly improving the lives of all Canadians. However, they have again decided to ignore that chance and opted for the same failed approaches they have given us since 2006.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249743">We will see what the Conservatives will do this week. However, I will do the right thing and vote against this budget because it is a continuation of the wrong approach toward first nations. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

A lot has been said about that over the course of this past year. Not only is the budget sorely inadequate when it comes to the needs and the economic development of first nations, but it also contains harmful and toxic measures. One of these harmful measures introduces workfare in first nations communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249746">My colleague spoke about this issue, and I would like to give him the opportunity to speak more about how the federal government's coercive measure for labour training, as the government likes to call it, will affect first nations.

I will be sharing my time with the wonderful member for <Affiliation DbId="170479" Type="2">York Centre</Affiliation>, a very hard-working member of our finance committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249757">It is my pleasure to speak to budget 2013. At the outset, I will outline for observers some of the processes that occur with respect to the preparation of budgets. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249758">As members of this place know, the finance committee, which I chair, starts its hearings going back even to the spring and summer prior to the presentation of the budget. We receive submissions. Typically we cut off submission dates in the summer and we prepare all those submissions for members; members then hear from witnesses from across the country in the fall. Last year, we heard about 800 submissions. The committee tried online submissions for the first time in its history; we received those submissions, and the members heard some oral testimony as well. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249759">We present our report to Parliament in December of each year, so we presented our pre-budget report in December. The budget is typically presented in February or March of the following year. We then follow with two budget implementation acts, one that we expect this spring and one that will occur in the fall. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249760">That is just to give people some context in terms of the actual budgetary process.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249761">I highlight that because there are numerous recommendations that our committee suggested in December in the budget itself, and I will refer to them as I go through the positive aspects of this budget.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249762">In terms of the overall budget plan, the government would continue its increase in transfers to the provinces for health care, education and social assistance. For health care, there would be 6% increases until 2017, and then it would be based on nominal GDP after 2017. It would increase support for provinces for education and social assistance at 3% per annum until 2017 as well. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249763">With respect to transfers to persons, those would increase, as obviously more people are receiving seniors' benefits each and every year. Family benefits would also increase going forward. There is an excellent graph and accompanying figures in the budget that reflect that increase. In terms of transfers to provinces and to persons, these transfers would continue to increase, as they have since 2006.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249764">The area of federal spending that the federal government more directly controls does not affect these areas. As members know, there was a program put in a place, a deficit reduction action plan, which examined about $70 billion of federal government spending, and it realized nearly 7% of savings, which is about 2% of what the federal government would spend over the course of the next few fiscal years. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249765">That was very much based on a lot of the pre-budget recommendations we made. Recommendations numbers 2, 3 and 4 all asked us to maintain transfers for provinces and persons, to restrain our own federal government spending and to balance the budget in the medium term, which was echoed by many business groups and other organizations before the committee. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business and the Canadian Chamber of Commerce strongly recommended that we continue to move toward a balanced budget in the medium term, so I am very pleased by that. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249766">However, these organizations and other individuals before the committee also strongly recommended certain areas that did require investments and said that we ought to continue to make investments.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249767"> I will relay some of the stories, challenges and issues from my own riding of Edmonton—Leduc, including the southwest part of Edmonton, the city of Leduc, the town of Devon, the industrial heartland of Nisku south of Edmonton and the Edmonton International Airport. It is a very dynamic and diverse riding, but we have some very strong challenges. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249768">The number one challenge that business people in that area raise with me is with respect to access to all types of labour, skilled and unskilled. I have taken visiting members of Parliament through my riding, especially through areas like Nisku where there are signs saying that if people are in one of six or seven listed professions, they should please stop in, because they need people. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249769">I recall that when I took the <Affiliation DbId="128705" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism</Affiliation> into a company, Tenaris, in the riding, one of its shifts was not working. We asked why the shift was not up and running, and the plant manager simply said that the company did not have enough people to operate that shift, that if it had enough people the shift would be operating and the company would be producing more, paying more tax, supporting more services and employing more Canadians. They simply could not find enough people. That is on the skilled side.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3249770">PCL also has a huge centre in Nisku. It could use engineers, welders, boilermakers and all types of skilled trades. Hospitals, hotels and restaurants will say they need skilled and unskilled people. They are simply short-staffed.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249771">One small business owner from the area with a restaurant chain and a drive-through service said at certain times he has to close down the drive-through, because people getting their lunch order would ask employees how much they were making an hour, and when they found out how much, they would give out business cards and say, “Call me tomorrow; we would like to hire you.”</ParaText><ParaText id="3249772">This is the labour situation and the labour challenges we are finding in our area, which is why it is the number one issue raised with me. That is why I am very pleased by things like the Canada job grant, increased support for apprentices and acting on the disability report recommendations in the budget. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249773">The reason I am such a big supporter of the Canada job grant is it actually engages employers and employees at a very direct level. A lot of the training done in the past by the provinces and the federal government has been valuable, but this is special in the sense that it engages employers and employees. It ensures that an employee is receiving training that will directly lead to a job and it matches employers and employees very directly. One of the common phrases used to describe our labour challenge today is “jobs without people and people without jobs”. That is a mismatch we have to address. That is exactly what the Canada job grant is trying to address. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249774">I will refer again to our pre-budget report recommendations 8, 9 and 10 through 16, which all deal with the need to address this labour challenge and ways in which to do it. That is what this budget does.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249775">Next is infrastructure. People often think a province like Alberta, which has seen relatively modest to strong growth over the last number of years, would not have a challenge with infrastructure. The reality is that we do, because when communities in southwest Edmonton or west Leduc or south Devon grow by 5% to 8% a year in the industrial sector, it puts a lot of challenges on our infrastructure. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249776">The municipalities all asked for a long-term infrastructure plan. They worked with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, an excellent organization. The current President, Karen Leibovici, a city councillor from Edmonton, did an excellent job in negotiating with the government a 10-year plan in terms of addressing infrastructure needs going forward. Obviously this will start when the building Canada fund expires in 2014. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249777">There are also things like renewing the P3 Canada fund, the new Canada building fund of $14 billion over 10 years, the community improvement fund at $32.2 billion over 10 years, and the gas fund tax payments and the GST rebate as well. With respect to the gas tax funding, municipalities say this is funding that they can count on and that they know is a certainty. They can then make investments and take out loans against the funding because they know it will be there. The fund can be used to access capital for the light rail transit developed in south Edmonton. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249778">In relation to the P3 project, I am very pleased that there was a recent announcement on the light rail expansion in southeast Edmonton, in the constituency of the member for <Affiliation DbId="170481" Type="2">Edmonton—Mill Woods—Beaumont</Affiliation>. It is a very large P3 project between PPP Canada and the City of Edmonton. Both organizations should be applauded for their work in making this happen.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249779">With respect to housing, again based on recommendations 52 and 53 in our pre-budget report, the housing investments over a long-term period were very good as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249780">In terms of investments in manufacturing, I am very pleased that we have continued the accelerated capital cost allowance for the manufacturing sector. I am personally very proud of that, as this was in an industry committee report that we produced in February 2007. The finance minister included it in the budget of March 2007, and it has continued since that time. I am very pleased because of the investments in there.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249781">There are also the investments in post-secondary education, based on recommendations 28 and 30 in pre-budget consultations. There is support for the federal research granting councils, for the Canada Foundation for Innovation, by working with excellent organizations like the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada, an excellent organization in terms of putting forward its recommendations for the budget.</ParaText>

I should have highlighted internships in my speech as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249791"> I can recall a conversation that I had with the current Governor General when he was then president of the University of Waterloo. I asked why Waterloo is so successful as an institution and why the surrounding community is so successful as a community in terms of spurring innovation. His answer to me was “internships”. They facilitate a direct connection between students, universities, businesses, between that innovative culture and climate, in giving students the experience. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249792">That is why I try to give as many opportunities to young people as I can. People gave me an opportunity and mentored me in various ways and showed me how to actually do this type of work. Young people are like sponges.

That is why these internships are so important, not only internships in terms of youth programs, but also internships and partnerships with respect to universities in this country.

We heard the Conservative government brag about the fact that it is increasing infrastructure spending.

This stable funding was very much welcomed by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. It is welcomed by the municipalities in my community. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249796">Obviously the long-term permanency and indexing of the gas tax fund ensures that municipalities can borrow against it going into the future.

This is very important. Our global reputation is strong. We have the best job creation record in the G7. There have been 950,000 net new jobs created since July 2009. We have the lowest debt to GDP ratio of any country in the G8. We have the highest possible credit ratings from Moody's, Fitch and Standard and Poor's.

The new budget is investing almost a billion dollars in strategic aerospace in the defence initiative to enhance the competitiveness of Canada's aerospace and defence industries. The budget also encourages new innovations in Canada's aerospace sector by creating the aerospace technology demonstration program.

During one budget consultation that I hosted in York Centre, I spoke with the Retail Council of Canada, and over 20 big businesses, ranging from Walmart to Costco to Cineplex to Kitchen Stuff Plus to Home Depot. The common theme I heard in their suggestions was that the price disparity between Canadian and U.S. stores makes it difficult to compete. Our government listened and thoroughly studied the Canada-U.S. retail price gap. In response to our study, the economic action plan 2013 will eliminate tariffs on baby clothing, sporting goods and athletic equipment. This will represent a total of $76 million in annual tariff relief for Canadian families and the goods they need.

Not only is this budget almost completely lacking in substance and content, the government has also used it primarily as a branding opportunity. At the end of the day, it contains a number of measures that are useless and, in many cases, downright harmful to Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249837">Unfortunately, the budget is lengthy simply because the government added image-boosting measures. I only have 20 minutes to speak, so I would like to get to the heart of the Conservative government's budget 2013 and explain why it goes against Canadians' interests.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249838">I will begin by speaking about the measure that has probably been the most controversial, particularly in Quebec, since 90% of the money allocated to this tax credit goes to labour-sponsored funds in Quebec. I am talking about eliminating the tax credit for labour-sponsored venture capital corporations. The government is looking to eliminate the 15% tax credit by 2017, thus saving $335 million. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249839">Why is the government taking this approach? We are hearing all sorts of reasons and excuses. When the question was put to the parliamentary secretary on Friday, she said that it was not working. The government consulted the OECD, which said that labour-sponsored venture capital was not bringing in sufficient returns, so it is time to move on to something else.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249840">Others are saying that it is because the funds now have sufficient capital and are effective. Depending on who you talk to, the funds are either working or they are not. The parliamentary secretary says one thing and the <Affiliation DbId="170704" Type="4">Minister of State for Small Business and Tourism</Affiliation> says another.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249841">The fact is that labour-sponsored funds work. This model for economic development has worked well in Quebec in the past and is still working. For example, I would like to mention Quebec's Fonds de solidarité FTQ, which was created 30 years ago. Since then, the Fonds de solidarité FTQ has invested more than $10 billion in Quebec. The money has been invested in start-up companies and in businesses that are having difficulties and need an infusion of capital to get back on track. Since 1990, the Fonds de solidarité has created or maintained 500,000 jobs in the province. The Conservatives are putting that template for success in danger by eliminating the tax credit for venture capital corporations.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249842">Furthermore, 60% of the fund's assets are invested in Quebec. This came out nowhere. There was no justification or preparation. It was only a few paragraphs, somewhere in the middle of the budget. No justification is given, and if there is any, it is contradictory.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249843">Nonetheless, what is interesting about this budget is that on pages 204 and 205, there is a section on enhancing Canada’s venture capital system. I would like to read part of that section:</ParaText><ParaText id="3249844"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Recognizing the importance of the venture capital industry to Canada's future productivity growth, Economic Action Plan 2012 announced resources to support Canada’s venture capital industry, including $400 million to help increase private sector investments in early-stage risk capital, and to support the creation of large-scale venture capital funds led by the private sector.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249845">What does this mean? This means that the Conservative government hopes to save $335 million by taking away a tax credit that benefited all Canadians, and especially Quebeckers who invested in the fund. The government is taking it back, only to turn around and give it to the private sector, to perform the same function. Budget 2013 renews 2012 provisions that allocated $250 million to establish new, large venture capital funds of funds, led by the private sector; $100 million to recapitalize existing large private sector-led funds of funds; and $50 million invested in three to five existing high-performing venture capital funds in Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249846">How can the Conservative government justify ending a measure that does so much to help Quebeckers' and Canadians' ability to save, and taking that money only to give it to the private sector to perform the same function, but less effectively? </ParaText><ParaText id="3249847">Indeed, with the Fonds de solidarité, the 15% allocated to tax credits served to recognize the fact that the fund did not perform as well as private funds.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3249848">The reason is quite simple. Labour-sponsored funds, like Fonds de solidarité FTQ and Fondaction CSN, quite often invest in local economies, in industries and in businesses that are of no interest to the private sector because such investments offer high risk and a low return over the long term. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249849">The purpose of the tax credit was not just to build these two funds, but also to recognize the different mandate that labour-sponsored funds have in terms of investing in and supporting local economies. In that sense, the Conservative government is missing the boat.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249850">I would like to quote what Marcel Côté, from SECOR, a consulting firm in Quebec, had to say about Quebec's Fonds de solidarité in particular, since that is the best known fund. He said:</ParaText><ParaText id="3249851"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">[The fund] has played a very important role in Quebec's economy and has served its purpose quite well. The fund has boosted savings and encouraged people to save for their retirement.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249852">Quebec's Fonds de solidarité has been criticized by the Montreal Economic Institute and the Fraser Institute—the usual suspects, as it were. According to them, the fund is not effective enough and does not perform well enough, and not enough assets are being invested. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249853">Quebec's Fonds de solidarité commissioned two studies to see whether the criticisms were founded, and one of those studies was conducted by SECOR, which, believe me, cannot be accused of having New Democratic leanings.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249854">One of the things SECOR wanted to determine was how long it took for the provincial and federal governments to recoup their initial investment. When money is invested and a business grows, more revenue is generated, either through the economic growth of the community or through the taxation of businesses that are making a profit. SECOR came to the conclusion that every dollar invested by the fund, every dollar of the tax credit allocated to local businesses or initiatives, was fully recouped by the federal government in three years.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249855">There is no net loss for the federal government. What the government does not recognize is that these are investments and that the tax credit represented an investment.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249856">Another measure that seems ridiculous to me is the phasing out of the additional deduction for credit unions. This measure affects credit unions and caisses populaires in Quebec with taxable capital employed in Canada of less than $15 million. Under this measure, the differential tax rate for small credit unions or caisses populaires will be eliminated by 2017.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249857">Why does the government not mention this? The individuals we spoke with on the government side once again gave contradictory reasons. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249858">However, as is the case with the labour-sponsored funds, we must recognize that the lower tax rate for small credit unions was in place as a result of their specific mandate, which is different than that of other banking institutions. An example that I am very familiar with is the caisses populaires in Quebec's rural communities. Very rarely is any trace of a bank found in communities of less than 1,000 people. In Quebec, these small communities have caisses populaires, and in other provinces, they have credit unions.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249859">The measure that the federal government wants to implement does not put everyone on a level playing field since it places credits unions and caisses populaires at a competitive disadvantage compared to major financial institutions, and for no good reason.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249860">I would like to speak briefly about infrastructure because we have talked about this in very broad terms. Although we would have preferred for the deadline to be even longer, we are satisfied with the longer deadline for predictable investments in infrastructure, whether it be through the building Canada fund, the community improvement fund or any other measure that was announced. The infrastructure plan will be carried out over 10 years, which is a good length of time, even though we would have preferred that it be carried out over 15 or 20 years. As the Federation of Canadian Municipalities and the Union des municipalités du Québec mentioned, at least this provides a predictable timeframe during which investments will be made.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249861">The government says a lot of things in its budget to enhance its image and its brand, but it has been very quiet about the fact that, during the first four years of the program, it is going to invest $4.7 billion less than the trend for the past four, five or six years suggested. There will therefore be much less money for the next four years, and municipalities will suffer as a result. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249862">I was shocked to see that one of the federal government's priorities is to help with workforce training and, as it so often mentions, to match job seekers with available jobs. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3249863">No one would deny that that is a laudable objective. We have to do something about the shortage of skilled workers in many places across the country. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249864">However, the government is talking about a new initiative and new funding, while it is taking back the funds and mandate already allocated to the provinces. The government gave the provinces this mandate because it fell under their natural jurisdiction. Now the government is taking the money and the mandate back and saying that it will now manage things from Ottawa. Not only will the government not give more money than what it was giving before, but it will also ask the private sector and the provinces—without negotiating or asking for their consent—to contribute dollar for dollar what the government contributes.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249865">Once again, the money that the federal government will invest is the money it was already giving to the provinces to manage this program. This money is being taken away from the provinces and they are being forced to invest the same amount if they want to take advantage of the program. The government is not considering the provinces' budgetary restrictions.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249866">The government is offloading the deficit onto the provinces. Although the government denies it, it is doing the exact same thing that past governments did when struggling with a deficit. This includes deficits under their government and under the Liberal Party. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249867">Once again, it is shocking to me that the government claims to respect the provinces' jurisdictions.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249868">The Supreme Court's ruling made it clear that the federal government was wrong to try to create a Canadian securities commission. The government can be involved, but this falls under provincial jurisdiction.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249869">We know that the provinces, with the exception of Ontario, have established a passport system, a single-desk system, to compensate for the lack of centralization or to compensate for too much decentralization in the securities system.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249870">If the government created a Canadian securities commission, it would be completely unconstitutional. Some provincial commissions, such as the Autorité des marchés financiers du Québec, are working with commissions in other provinces, except Ontario. We hope that Ontario will join the group. They are looking to remove the barriers facing Canadian—and foreign—investors because this commission does not exist.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249871">What is the government doing? Despite the Supreme Court's decision, the government is sticking to its guns in the budget, saying that Canada needs a Canadian securities commission. The government is interpreting the Supreme Court decision as it sees fit and is continuing in that direction.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249872">By continuing down that path, the government will hit the same wall, because the provinces reject Ottawa's determination to interfere in this area. The government will hit another wall at the Supreme Court, which was very clear in its decision.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249873">On this side of the House, we have a lot of difficulty understanding why the federal government persists in going in this direction, which seems to be a waste of time. This government would do much better to work with all the provinces to establish this passport system, which is a single desk for securities authorities across the country and for financial market authorities.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249874">The government is claiming that it does not want to increase taxes. It is accusing us of talking about completely hypothetical and fake tax increases, when we are not even in power. They are the ones who form the government.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249875">The <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170479" Type="2">York Centre</Affiliation> did not brag about it, but a massive tax increase will affect all Canadians. It will take more than $1.5 billion out of Canadians' pockets over the next five years. It is an increase in customs tariffs that, once again, came out of nowhere.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249876">In the next fiscal year, the federal government will start increasing customs tariffs on over 1,200 products from 72 different countries. The increase represents nearly $350 million a year on various products, from table fans to umbrellas to cornstarch. All these products will be taxed.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3249877">It will not be the federal government that pays. Even though the government is arguing that it subsidizes these countries with a lower preferential tariff—an argument that makes no sense—it is Canadians who will pay more because of these new measures. It is hypocritical for a government that claims it is not increasing taxes to tax Canadians in this way. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249878">Although it has tried to use all kinds of tricks as a distraction—such as eliminating tariffs on some sports equipment—the increase in customs tariffs will amount to 10 times what Canadians might save on a few small items. This measure to close markets is totally hypocritical on the part of a government that claims to be interested in opening up international markets. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249879">What is more, this could be justified by saying that the government is reclassifying countries that were previously considered to be developing countries and have now become industrialized, such as Hong Kong and South Korea, which are similar. However, it is increasing tariffs for countries it considers to be fully developed and in this group is including Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Cuba, Kazakhstan and many other countries with economies that are not at all like those of South Korea or Hong Kong. I cannot understand this decision by a government that boasts about opening our country to international markets. Implementing this measure is completely ridiculous. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249880">I would like to talk about one last element. I spent some time looking at the economic indicators used by the federal government. Once again, they show a certain degree of incompetence. The <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> botched his latest forecasts for revenues and the Canadian deficit. He was mistaken by a margin of more than 35%. I have the impression that the same thing will happen in the next two years. The Minister of Finance is forecasting real growth of 2.5% and 2.6% for the next two years.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249881">Obviously growth is important since it leads to increased revenues that will help determine whether the government will achieve a balanced budget. This past year, economic growth was only 1.6%. For the next two years, the federal government expects the economy to grow by roughly half as much again. I understand that that is what private sector economists are saying, but they were way off in their predictions in the past two years.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249882">If the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> really wanted to pay attention to the Canadian economy and not fixate on balancing the budget by 2015 at all costs, then he should consider the fact that private sector economists have been wrong in the past and that their predictions have been far too rosy. This will have an impact on the total increase in revenues. This past year, revenues increased by $4.7 billion, and the government predicts that revenues will increase by $7 billion and $11.8 billion in the next two years. This will have a significant impact on the government's objective to balance the budget.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249883">Another interesting thing is to see what impact austerity measures might have on the budget. A 1% decrease of real GDP will result in $13.7 billion in lost revenues over three years. That is rather significant. A 1% decrease in real GDP is exactly what the Parliamentary Budget Officer and other economists following the Department of Finance's model said would happen as a result of the austerity measures the federal government has adopted since 2012.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249884">The government is clearly incompetent when it comes to economic management. Its ideology is getting in the way of its attempt at sound economic management for Canada. From where I am standing, the Conservatives are not running the country driven by the well-being of Canadians, their families and their communities, but by an ideology that would eliminate any positive role that the federal government might play in the economy and in the daily lives of Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249885">Services are being cut, the most vulnerable are being attacked and the most affluent are being rewarded.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3249886">This budget smacks of economic incompetence. This budget is more about image and branding and less about substance and content. That is why we will be opposing this budget.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

This reduction will affect how the provinces manage their health care systems. </ParaText><ParaText id="3249892">What is even more problematic about this loss of revenue for the provinces compared to what they had in the past is the fact that this decision was unilateral.

Taxpayers are the ones who invest in these funds because they want to invest in their local economy, and they are the ones who will pay the price.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249899">In one breath, the government is clawing back $350 million that was allocated as tax credits for labour-sponsored funds, and in the next breath, it is handing $400 million to private companies that have the same mandate but are much less effective and less focused on regional economic development.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249900">Why are we taking $355 million that would go to taxpayers and giving it to venture capital companies to fund them, bail them out or create new companies? That makes no sense. The government has said that it wants tax neutrality, but labour-sponsored funds and credit unions are now at a disadvantage compared to their private counterparts, because they have a very different mandate. From this point on, taxation can no longer reflect that reality.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Economic action plan 2013 builds upon the work from previous budgets and the government's impressive track record guiding Canada through the worst global economic slowdown. We are now in a leadership position amongst the countries of the G8.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249919">The focus of the 2013 budget is clearly upon jobs for Canadians. It is about leveraging the jobs we have now in Canada through our leadership in financial services, resource development and technological innovation. It is also about securing the jobs of the future and reorienting our skills training and lifelong learning programs to ensure we provide Canadians with the tools they need to maintain our strong position in the world. Finally, economic action plan 2013 makes key investments in areas of priority for Canadians: families, seniors, veterans and our first nations. These investments are important and are being made in a budget premised upon two fundamental principles.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249920"> First is the government's laser-like focus on getting Canada back to a balanced budget by 2015. This is to ensure we maintain our quality of life and maintain one of the strongest credit ratings in the world for the purpose of financing our debt. Second is the critical commitment we make to seniors and families across Canada to balance our budget without resorting to raising taxes.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249921">At a time when government revenues are somewhat flat, these two fundamental principles are not easy. The opposition suggests billions in new spending on almost a weekly basis. The <Affiliation DbId="181199" Type="96">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> has suggested that the government should not stick to our timeline of balancing the budget. Mere days before the budget, he went to New York to tell the business press that he would raise taxes on Canadian employers if the NDP were in power.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249922">Following the release of economic action plan 2013, which was very careful to maintain core entitlement program spending and increase transfers to the provinces and territories, the NDP leader said, “You cannot 'austere' your way out of a crisis”. The NDP leader's cute turn of phrase and commitment to runaway spending and higher taxes reminds me of the Winston Churchill quote that compares a nation trying to tax its way into prosperity to a man standing in a bucket, trying to lift himself up by pulling the handle.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249923">The challenging global economy and shifting labour realities requires the type of strong leadership that our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has shown from the doldrums of the global economic recession to the present day. Economic action plan 2013 is about setting priorities that will maintain a focus on jobs for Canadians and a plan to ensure our prosperity for decades to come.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249924">Our government is proud of its record of 950,000 net new jobs having been created since the depth of the recession in 2009. This leads the G8 nations and has helped maintain our quality of life when other areas of the world are in turmoil. Our government is, however, committed to a relentless pursuit of higher employment, particularly for young Canadians, aboriginal Canadians and in areas of the country experiencing a higher than average rate of unemployment.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249925">Accordingly, I would like to speak to three key areas of economic action plan 2013, premised upon securing jobs for Canadians.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249926">The first area is the government's innovative approach to filling the skills gap in Canada, while also helping transitional industries retrain and re-equip their workforces. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business, in its 2012 statistics, indicates that 34% of small to medium-size businesses face a skilled labour shortage. This means that while some Canadians are having a hard time finding a job, some Canadian employers are having a hard time filling a job. Finding a solution to marry these two aspects of our economy should be the overarching public policy goal of any government. Our government is making that the top priority.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3249927">The Canada job grant will address the skills shortage in Canada by assisting up to 130,000 Canadians each year with short duration training for the workforce. The $5,000 per person grant has the multiplier effect two times over, up to $15,000 with our provincial and employer partners. The Canada job grant will allow employers facing skills shortages or training facilitators in the industry to work with both the federal and provincial governments on a solution that will help them increase their productivity, while also helping more Canadians find long-term employment.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249928">The skills deficit in the marketplace is the true determinant of where skills training investment needs to go. This will allow the federal government to negotiate transformative labour market agreements with the provinces and territories.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249929">Our government recognizes that the largest skills shortage in Canada is in the skills trades and in the engineering and mathematics fields across the country. Economic action plan 2013 will work toward reducing barriers on apprentice accreditation and support the use of apprentices in all areas of national procurement and investment.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249930">The government is also earmarking $19 million to promote engineering sciences and mathematics to young Canadians in an effort to help young people fill these critical roles in our economy. Outstanding schools like the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, which serves my riding of Durham, have world-class programs in these core areas that will help our young men and women find engaging employment right out of school.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249931">The government is committing $241 million to ensure that young aboriginal Canadians have access to skills training to assist in raising employment levels on reserve through a realignment of the income assistance program.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249932">I had the pleasure of joining 200 other Canadians at the Governor General's Canadian leadership conference last summer near months before my election to Parliament. It was an excellent opportunity to see some of the policy challenges facing our country. I was part of a group of 17 Canadians who toured the province of Alberta, meeting with business, political, social and aboriginal leaders. Every community we visited and almost every leader we spoke to described the labour shortage in Alberta as one of the most pressing issues facing the province. Indeed, it was placed as one of our key findings in our Governor General's Canadian leadership conference group. The economic opportunity in Alberta is of tremendous benefit to all Canadians and meeting the challenges this opportunity poses must engage all Canadians.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249933">The second key area I would like to highlight from economic action plan 2013 is the building Canada plan. Nothing underscores the ability of this government to set priorities to secure our long-term prosperity better than this element of the budget. I would recommend page 171 of the budget to my colleagues to see this impressive plan represented visually.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249934">The building Canada plan is an ambitious $53 billion 10-year plan to secure and enhance our nation's critical infrastructure and establish predictable long-term partnerships with the provincial and municipal governments across Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249935">The building Canada fund will inject $14 billion into our economy in priority infrastructure projects, with a national, provincial or local significance. First nation infrastructure is part of the building Canada plan and will see $155 million directed toward critical energy, road, bridge and civic infrastructure alongside investments in broadband connectivity to complement economic development efforts on reserve.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249936">The relentless focus on jobs and supporting skills trades in Canada is built into the building Canada plan. As part of its consultation and planning with other levels of government, the federal government will directly encourage the use of apprentices in projects receiving federal funding.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249937">The third area I want to touch on briefly in economic action plan 2013 provides for small business in the manufacturing sector in Ontario. On the same day that our <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> delivered the budget, the Scugog Chamber of Commerce in my riding celebrated its Business of the Year awards.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249938">Small businesses are often the foundation of our local economies and have been an important focus of our government. We have kept taxes low for these businesses for many years and have assisted with the difficult challenge of whether to hire one more person or not through the small business hiring credit. This budget expands this hiring credit by providing up to $1,000 against the rise in EI premiums as a result of hiring a new person. We are also increasing the lifetime capital gains exemption to $800,000, which will also directly benefit small business owners.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3249939">While our government has shown its support for small businesses in Canada, I take this occasion to support Kenna Kozak from the Scugog Chamber of Commerce, Sheila Hall from the Clarington Board of Trade and Angela Horne from the Uxbridge Chamber of Commerce. These organizations in Durham, and others like them across the country, are the lifeblood of the small business community. They not only raise important policy issues to our government, they also serve to connect small businesses in a way to one another.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249940">Finally, manufacturers will also benefit in southern Ontario with our government's proposed $1.4 billion toward an accelerated capital cost allowance—</ParaText>

In reality, when the Conservative Party formed government a few years back, it was handed millions of dollars of surplus and then it turned that into a deficit, even in pre-recession times. According to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, we were not even in a recession, yet the Conservatives turned that surplus into a deficit.

The previous Liberal government's approach to balancing the federal government was essentially through passing along the challenges of a changing economy to provincial partners, a massive reduction in transfer to the provinces that left provincial premiers, whether NDP in Saskatchewan or Progressive Conservative in Ontario, to be the real people cutting for the federal government. At the same time, the hon. member would know that the government of the day also took advantage of an EI surplus that had grown to help it in a way that really was not a revenue stream it should have taken.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249949">One of the key things our government recognized when we came to office was that Canadians, particularly seniors and families, were overtaxed.

He is truly the best and most respected finance minister in the world.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249956">When the global recession hit in 2009, our government acted quickly and took decisive steps to ensure our economic recovery.

A single pensioner, for example, earning $3,500 or more will now be able to keep up to an additional $1,500 in annual benefits. We have also increased the age limit for RRSP to RRIF from 69 to 71; established the landmark tax-free savings account, which is particularly beneficial for seniors; introduced the largest GIS increase over 25 years, which gave eligible low-income seniors additional benefits of up to $600 for single seniors and $840 for couples, helping more than 680,000 seniors across Canada, and, of course, removing 380,000 seniors from the tax rolls.</ParaText>

This is of interest, since he can find articles from July 25, 2008 by Reuters and CBC talking about the fact that the country was in deficit.

With yet more cuts to the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans, at this point Conservatives are amputating bone. There is no more meat within DFO to cut. I will come back to that in a moment. The Conservatives are charging tax on hospital parking. Newfoundlanders and Labradorians are already vicious with the fact that they are being charged to park outside hospitals, in other words, charged to see their doctors. By increasing the age of eligibility for old age security to 67 from 65, this budget is not a good one for Newfoundland and Labrador. It is not good for the fisheries. It is not good for the sick. It is not good for their families. It is not good for seniors.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249994"> It is not good for first nations. Workfare is to be introduced in this budget whereby aboriginal youth will be forced to work for their benefits. At the same time, post-secondary funding for aboriginal youth does not come close to meeting the need. This budget is also not good for the unemployed. The Conservatives are following through on their EI changes that punish workers by forcing them to take lower paying jobs or jobs outside of their communities, outside of their outports. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249995">This budget is not good for the vast majority of students. There is nothing in the budget to tackle crippling student debt. The average federal student debt load stands at $28,000. There is a problem in this country with accessibility and affordability of post-secondary education from one province to the next, and there is nothing in this budget to address that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249996">This budget is not good for the vast majority of young Canadians. There are 240,000 more young Canadians unemployed today than there were before the recession. All this budget does for youth job creation is to re-announce $70 million in funding over three years for 5,000 internships. That is a start, but, again, it skims the surface of the actual need.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249997">Closer to home, there is nothing in the Conservative budget to offset the 4% increase to Marine Atlantic fares that is due to come into effect on April 1. If that does not amount to a tax increase for all of Newfoundland and Labrador, I do not know what does. News flash for the Conservatives: Newfoundland is an island, and when the ferry rates are increased the cost of everything eventually goes up. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3249998">There is barely a mention of Labrador in the budget. The one mention there was for an old jobs program. For Conservatives, and I said this last week during question period, Labrador is just a place to pull puppet strings. If Labrador cannot get a decent mention in a federal budget that is released on the eve of a federal byelection in Labrador, well, Labrador will never get anything. Conservatives seem more preoccupied with winning the Labrador seat than actually doing something concrete for Labrador.</ParaText><ParaText id="3249999">I also mentioned last week that back home they are saying “you either do it the right way, or the Penashue”. Conservatives choose to cheat Labradorians out of fair representation. That is the Penashue, and Conservatives defend it at every turn.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250000">The Atlantic caucus of the New Democratic Party was in Labrador West this past fall. One of the chief concerns we heard in Labrador West was the desperate need for affordable housing. The mining industry, iron ore specifically, is doing very well but the vacancy rate is almost zero. The local college offers a mining course that practically guarantees employment, but classes are not full because there is no place for students to live. We heard stories about how women remain in abusive relationships because there is nowhere else for them to go. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3250001">There is nothing in the Conservative budget that tackles the national housing crisis in any real way. The Conservative government is investing $253 million in affordable housing, but that does nothing to address the lack of affordable housing in Canada through a national housing strategy. Throwing money at the provinces in the absence of a national plan is irresponsible. It makes no sense.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250002">I should have said at the start that I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170267" Type="2">Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3250003">I stood in the House in February to address the need for a national housing strategy, to talk about Labrador's needs and to talk about housing needs in the northeast Avalon peninsula in Newfoundland. What did every Conservative member, including Peter Penashue, do? They voted against a national housing strategy. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250004">There is nothing in the budget for the people of Labrador. Let me reiterate. If Labrador cannot get anything substantive from a federal budget that is released on the eve of a federal byelection in Labrador, from what would seem to be an election budget for Labrador, then it will never get anything from the Conservative government. Newfoundland and Labrador MPs are supposed to represent Newfoundland and Labrador in Ottawa. They are not supposed to represent Ottawa in Newfoundland and Labrador. That is the Penashue way. That is not the right way. It is not the New Democratic way.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3250005">I mentioned DFO earlier in my speech. Newfoundland and Labrador may not be the great fishing epicentre that it once was. The Grand Banks of Newfoundland may not be what they once were, but that does not mean the Government of Canada should walk away from the responsibility for our fisheries that it took over when Newfoundland joined Confederation in 1949. However, that is what is happening. The latest cut has the Conservative government slashing the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans' budget by $108 million over six years. There is talk that regional headquarters, like the one in St. John's, Newfoundland, could close. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250006">I would like to quote from the budget:</ParaText><ParaText id="3250007"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">To complement these savings, Fisheries and Oceans Canada will also improve regional program efficiency by reducing management overhead and consolidating decision-making authority.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3250008">Does that say directly that regional offices will close? No, the wording never does, but the writing most definitely appears on the wall.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3250009">I also mentioned hospital parking earlier in my speech. This budget would require GST and HST be paid on all hospital parking. Currently, public sector bodies are exempt; the change would make parking spaces or facilities operated by a municipality or hospital taxable. Canadians, Newfoundlanders and Labradorians see the parking fees, which are most definitely destined to increase, as a financial barrier to health care. The Conservative government is going to charge people to see their doctors. That is what this would amount to. It is going to charge people for medical treatment. That is what this would amount to.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250010">Let me sum up all the people that the Conservative government is leaving behind or so arrogantly neglecting in this budget: Newfoundlanders and Labradorians first; Labrador, or the big land, in particular; seniors; students; young people; first nations; low-income Canadians and fishermen. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250011">Labradorians are lucky in a way. As I mentioned, a byelection will be called there soon, a byelection in which the people of Labrador will have an opportunity to send the message to the Conservatives that their way of governing by dictating from Ottawa, without a moral compass, is unacceptable. All Canadians should be so lucky to have that voting opportunity, because the Conservatives would find themselves out of office here and now and we would not have to wait two more long years.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

If I have to say that the government is incompetent, I will address the remark through you.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250368">I cannot tell the House what I really think about this budget because someone would raise a point of order. To put it politely, I think that, once again, middle-class Canadians are the ones who will pay the price and whose quality of life will suffer. I will not even talk about what will happen to poor people. They will basically not even have a quality of life now that this budget has been tabled. The problem is that, more and more often, this government is sticking the provinces with the bill and interfering in areas of provincial jurisdiction. That is really problematic for the provinces.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250369">The budget gave the government the opportunity to propose a sensible employment insurance reform. There have been many popular uprisings, a coalition has been created in Quebec, and the maritime provinces are protesting. The government could have added one more thing to the budget, taken something out or announced a new investment. That would have been worthwhile. It would have proved that the government is listening to Canadians; however, I see that that is not the case.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250370">I toured my region to speak with entrepreneurs affected by the EI reform, and they all told me that the reform is extremely problematic for their companies and industries. Seasonal industries, such as the horticulture and fishing industries in the maritime provinces and the agricultural industry in my riding, are struggling.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250371">The government should also have backtracked on pensions and announced new investments in this area. Last year, the government suddenly announced that people who had worked hard all their lives, sometimes in jobs requiring manual labour, would have to wait two more years before they could retire. Once again, there were many popular uprisings, and individuals, workers and even employers spoke out about this situation. Yet the government did nothing. It is obvious that the government does not listen to Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250372">Earlier, I was talking about how the quality of life of the middle class is deteriorating. Yet, the government plans to eliminate the federal tax credit for the FTQ and CSN funds by 2017. That means that small investors may no longer be able to save. This tax credit really helped them. Now, there will be people who will not have any money for retirement and who are unable to save. All they need is some help from the government, but the government will no longer be there to help them. Simply put, we have reached an impasse.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250373">On the weekend I received dozens of emails from my constituents who were writing to say that they disagree with eliminating this tax credit. Chambers of commerce got in touch with me to say that this was not good. These funds are reinvested in the community. I do not see why the government would not continue to want healthy communities, where businesses are growing. I do not see why the government has a problem with this. This measure serves no purpose. It only hurts small investors, workers, employers, industry, businesses and Quebec.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250374">I do not understand why the government is eliminating credits for caisses populaires. The caisses populaires have quite a history. Many businesses in Quebec got off the ground because a caisse populaire believed in people who could not borrow money from the banks. The Cirque du Soleil is one such example. This global enterprise was created in Quebec. It was able to take flight because of Caisse Desjardins. Today, it is putting Quebec on the map. However, the government has suddenly lost interest in this type of investment.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="30">(1530)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3250375">I could talk about services to the public. Earlier, I was talking about EI reform and the quality of life for the middle class. It comes back to that again here.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250376">The Canada Revenue Agency will have to review its practices to become more efficient, and the government says that this will have no impact on the public. That is what it said about Service Canada, when cuts were made there. People ended up having to wait. They did not know where to go and there was no one on the other end of the line to help them when they called. Are we going to end up in the same situation with the Canada Revenue Agency? I think so.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250377">The government cannot make cuts and expect that the public is going to receive exactly the same service with less staff. That is wishful thinking. The government is good at wishful thinking.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250378">I cannot speak to the budget without talking about agriculture, since 90% of the land in my riding is farmland. Eastern Montérégie is known as Quebec's pantry, which speaks volumes. In this budget, there is absolutely no mention of agriculture. The word “agriculture” does not appear anywhere. Is this a problem? This is about our food sovereignty.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250379">The government made cuts to agriculture last year that are still being felt this year because the cuts were spread out. There will be about $158 million in cuts this year. That is a huge problem, especially when we consider that agriculture feeds people and that farmers need a helping hand to feed people. Does this government want to jeopardize our food sovereignty by making cuts to agriculture and by not acknowledging that this is a critical issue for a country must maintain food sovereignty, especially a country like Canada, which must feed 34 million people? That was not mentioned once in the budget. I cannot believe it and it makes me so angry.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250380">I could also talk about infrastructure. In its budget, the government says it is investing $70 billion in infrastructure. Congratulations. However, when I crunch the numbers myself, I see that $4.7 billion less will be invested in infrastructure compared to last year, if we take inflation into account. It is all well and good to talk about $70 billion. It sounds like a big number, but that is over 10 years and we must consider that Canada's infrastructure is in bad shape. Just think of the Champlain Bridge in Montreal. I am taking a risk when I cross that bridge every week. One of these days, something is sure to happen to me.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250381">We need federal assistance for infrastructure. The municipalities' hands are full and the provinces also need some help. I do not see how the government can think that investing $70 billion in infrastructure over 10 years makes it a hero.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250382">Earlier, I spoke about the middle class. Now, I would like to talk about people who are struggling even more, people who often have no income: the homeless. The HPS program has been renewed. This is good. However, the funding is much lower than in previous years and, once again, the federal government is really interfering in programs dealing with needs that should be determined by the regions. That is not what I see in the budget. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250383">The government is investing $253 million in housing. That is a drop in the bucket and is not at all what we need. I should also point out that there is still no national housing strategy.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250384">I could go on for another 20 minutes about what this budget is lacking, but my time is running out, so I will stop there.

I want to particularly note off the top the comments of His Worship Daryl Bennett, mayor of the city of Peterborough, who indicated a couple of things: the indexing of the gas tax and the long-term infrastructure dollars that have been set up to support municipalities, to support infrastructure right across the country in public transit. His Worship Daryl Bennett said specifically that he appreciated not only the indexing of the gas tax fund, but also that we had provided a long-term window for planning, which municipalities need. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250457">He also said something else that was critically important. As a person with experience in business, he spoke about how much he appreciated that our government was fiscally responsible, that our government was headed back to a balanced fiscal situation, back to balanced budgets. The mayor of the city of Peterborough stood four-square behind this economic action plan, and I want to extend my thanks for his input into our federal budgeting process.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250458">I talked a bit about the electric city region of Peterborough. Peterborough was nicknamed the electric city because it was the first city in North America to have electric street lights go on. It is in fact a home of innovation. It is the home of General Electric Canada and Quaker Oats. It is the home of Rolls-Royce, which has invested so much into Canada's nuclear industry. These industries are critical to Canada's financial success. These are manufacturing companies that employ so many Canadians and lead with innovative products.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250459">When I look at Peterborough's past as a manufacturing hub and I look at our entire region, I see the creativity. I see what these companies have created. This budget is exactly the right budget for the times because it will encourage and foster that very kind of innovation, the next step of that innovation, growth in manufacturing. We are seeing that in my region with investments our government has made in the last number of years and we will continue to see it moving forward.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250460"> The budget will do a number of things.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250461"> My education is in business. I spent a lot of time studying accounting, finance and economics. One of the things I have specifically done over the last couple of years is challenge the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants. I have had many meetings with the institute and talked specifically about the issue of depreciation of assets. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250462">This budget will once again extend accelerated capital cost allowances for manufacturers for investment in capital equipment, and this is important. A lot of people at home might wonder why this would matter, what this would mean to them, why this would benefit companies. There has been a big change, certainly since the generally accepted accounting principles, or GAP, was thought up. We looked at depreciation of assets and we said that an asset should be set to depreciate over its useful life. It should depreciate in a straight line, so much depreciation per year, until that asset is written off for tax purposes.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250463"> If we are going to improve Canada's productivity, if we are going to lead in innovation, if we are going to be a country that encourages investment in next generation manufacturing, then we can no longer talk about the useful life of an asset. We have to talk about the antiquated life of an asset. This is critically important because a machine can still work fine, it can still produce. I have a laptop computer on my desk which I think is five years old. It still works, but this is not current technology. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3250464"> If we want to keep up with the best in the world and be as productive as we can possibly be, that is what our manufacturers are faced with. They must have that new equipment. They must be able to write it off in such a way that they can make a business case for making the investment in the first place. The banks will ask them, when they are seeking to borrow dollars, what the payback is on a new machine and what they expect to earn. That is why accelerated capital cost allowance matters. That is why the budget has, once again, made that specific measure of $1.4 billion in tax relief for manufacturers so they can invest and create jobs. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250465">Paschal McCloskey, the owner of McCloskey International, came to me prior to the last election and said that without the measures our government had taken to reduce corporate taxes, to reduce business taxes, there was no way he would have been able to expand his company on the east side of Peterborough, which now employs over 400 people. There was no way he could have expanded the manufacturing facility because he could not compete on price globally. This company ships innovative machines around the world. It could not do it without the tax breaks we put in place.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250466">I note today an article produced by the CBC, fine journalism on behalf of the CBC. It points out a study that has just been completed by the accounting firm PwC, the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation. What did that study find? The best country in the G8 for business taxes is Canada. We have improved from 28th position overall. Out of over 150 nations, we were 28th in 2010. This year we are eighth and we are the best in the G8 by a wide margin.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250467">What are the effective tax rates on business in the G8 nations? In Canada it is 26.9% of profits. In the United Kingdom it is 35.5%. In France it is 65.7%. In the United States it is 46.7%. In Germany it is 46.8%. We have almost a 20% advantage over the United States.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250468">Why does that matter for manufacturers in Canada? Why does that matter for job creators? Why does that matter in terms of attracting international investment?</ParaText><ParaText id="3250469">It matters because in some other ways we have become a bit of a high-cost jurisdiction. Wage rates in Canada tend to be higher than they are in a lot of countries with which we compete. That is why we are putting incentives in, such as accelerated capital costs. That is why we are eliminating import tariffs on manufacturing equipment. We have put these measures in place so our manufacturers can compete globally, keep their costs low so they can continue to create jobs. Each and every manufacturing job created in Canada supports about eight other jobs in the economy. We know how important that is.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250470">I want to talk a bit about a couple of measures, specifically for southern Ontario, that the government has invested into, programs that are in fact delivering big time, with big time dividends for the people of Peterborough, the people of southwestern Ontario, the people of central Ontario and the people of eastern Ontario. These are important investments.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250471">The Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario will receive five years in renewed funding of $920 million.

First is the one I raised during question period today, which is the surprise decision by the government to eliminate a competitive advantage that was given to the credit unions and the caisses populaires in the seventies to allow them to compete with the banks on a level playing field. I also wish to touch on the federal public service, the matter of R and D, and a very important local institution, the National Capital Commission.</ParaText><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3250490">I will begin by talking about co-operatives.</ParaText><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3250491">As I said, the co-ops, credit unions and caisse populaires have a reduced tax rate. That is being taken away. They are getting a tax increase of about 36%. They are going from 11% to 15%. The reason the tax rate had been given is so that they could capitalize. Even the banks recognized that they needed it. I will quote the analyst from the National Bank Financial. He said:</ParaText><ParaText id="3250492"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Credit unions serve a different market, run higher costs partially as a result, and do not have access to capital other than retained earnings and preferred share instruments issued to members. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3250493">His name is Peter Routledge. He is an analyst at National Bank Financial, and I totally agree with him. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250494">The reason the government had agreed to give and maintain this credit is so that credit unions could compete with the banks and offer financial services in small town Canada, where many banks had withdrawn their services. We have a situation where all of a sudden without any consultation, in the budget on Thursday credit unions and caisse populaires learned about this and wondered where it came from. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250495">One wonders how the government justified its comments in the few pages just before that decision. These comments contradict what it had just decided, and I will quote the budget book, on page 147.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250496"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The Government will review the regulatory framework, including the process for approval of new financial institutions, to ensure that it promotes the entry and growth of smaller institutions, while preserving the safety and soundness of the sector.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3250497">However, for the safety and soundness of the sector, credit unions and caisse populaires have demonstrated their soundness.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250498">How can the government say on the one hand that it wants to encourage entry and growth of smaller institutions, and then tax them? The credit unions were essentially small and growing credit institutions, offering services where the banks, the big six, are not, and then it taxes them. I was reading this on the weekend with my contradictory detector, and then the alarm sounded.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250499">Where is this coming from? That is what I asked the government, and I did not get a real answer. The government changed this two months after the government acknowledged, in its written response to the special committee on co-ops that was set up by this chamber unanimously last May, and which reported to the government in September. In its response on January 28, the government said essentially that it recognized and understood that capitalization was still a challenge for co-operative businesses. Yet two months later, boom, this happens.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250500">One could suspect that the government might have been lobbied. That is a suspicion that I have. The same gentleman I quoted made another quote that is rather astounding. This was in <I>The Globe and Mail</I> on Thursday. He said:</ParaText><ParaText id="3250501"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Credit unions benefit mightily from CMHC mortgage insurance so one could look at that as a federal government “subsidy” that they now have to pay a little more via the tax code. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3250502">Yes, CMHC insures mortgages, but it does for the banks as well. I want to point out, in 2008, when it was a year of some financial difficulties around the world, including in Canada, the government put $125 billion on the table to ensure the credit of banks would not dry up, via CMHC. There was $69 billion of that which was taken up by banks; hardly any of that was taken up by credit unions. The banks saying the credit unions are getting a subsidy advantage from CMHC, forgetting that they are too, is something we should be very careful of.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3250503">When people profit from investment in bank shares, they get a 50% capital gains deduction. They do not have to pay tax on the first 50%. If the Conservatives had said in their budget on Thursday that maybe that ought to be reduced somewhat, say by a few percentage points, or by 36%, the equivalent of what they have taken away from the credit unions today, I am pretty sure the phones would not have stopped ringing in the government offices. I am not suggesting we do that, but that is a basis of comparison. The members of co-ops, credit unions and caisse populaires are essentially their shareholders, and now they are being dinged by a 36% tax increase. For the shareholders of banks, that is not the case. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250504"> I have asked numerous people over the last few months if they were aware of the amount of bonuses paid to bank executives and the higher echelons in the banks in Canada. No one I have talked to knew the amounts. That has to become a known fact. Last year, it was $10.3 billion that was paid to Canadian bank executives. The year before, it was $9.2 billion. In 2008, when we had fairly serious financial difficulties and the banks were offered a loan of $125 billion, about $7 billion was paid to bank executives. Before we start taxing credit unions more, maybe we ought to consider putting a cap on the bonuses that banks can pay to themselves, as is being considered now in some European countries, Germany being among them.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250505">I want to ensure we realize the importance in the financial system of credit unions and caisse populaires. Before the Conservatives propose doing more things, they should have had the decency of talking to them first and not just announcing the decisions. I would hope they would even want to reconsider, given the importance of credit unions in small town Canada where there are no other financial institutions.</ParaText><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3250506">I would like to set this issue aside for a moment and focus on the public service.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250507">I would have liked to see an improvement in the antagonistic relationship the government seems to have with our public servants, but that does not appear to be the case. In last year's budget, members will recall that the government said it would eliminate 19,000 public service jobs. Most of the unions representing public servants agree that many more have been lost, if we include the jobs that had already been eliminated and those currently being eliminated.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250508">The way the government is doing this is just incredible. For every job it eliminates, it drives five other public servants into uncertainty. For the 19,000 or 20,000 jobs it wants to eliminate, it will advise 100,000 public servants that their jobs could be at risk. It is spreading terror throughout the public service.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250509">When someone receives a notice, a letter—for that is how it is done—informing them that their job could be at stake, can you imagine what must happen after that? Fear must immediately strike the hearts of these people and their families. This has an impact on the economies of the communities in which these people live. It also has an impact on productivity, when an employee knows that they have a sword of Damocles hanging over their head and that someone could cut the cord. We need to fix this. </ParaText><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3250510">On R and D, I have no problems with the notion of investing in the applied part of that science, but I am worried that we have been neglecting basic and pure research. The 12 Canadian scientists who won Nobel prizes did not win them for applied research; they won them for basic and pure research. I hope the government would take notice of some concerns, which are now becoming more forceful, to not abandon basic research. The DNA was basic research, and that is having a major impact down the road. There is a number of these examples. If we neglect those, down the road we will suffer. We will pay for that, so let us ensure we keep an equilibrium.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250511"> As far as the NCC is concerned, quite simply if the Conservatives are serious about keeping the NCC, then they have one thing to do and do fast, which is appoint a CEO.

The government is responsible for maintaining a central fund. If there is a deficit in the employment insurance fund, the government's central fund is used to make up for the deficit and, if there is a surplus, the central fund absorbs it. Therefore, my answer to the member's question is no.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250516">Premiums should not be unduly increased, but that is what the Conservative government is currently doing. It is increasing premiums by $600 million, when that is not necessary. If I were in my colleague's shoes, I would be concerned, because the increase in premiums is a direct tax on the employer and the employee. If it is not necessary, why do it? This is what governments do to get around the situation. When we were in power, we reduced annual premiums year after year until a balance was reached.

I am not sure we will be able to gather all the income the minister thinks can be found while the government is cutting the source that he hopes will find these incomes, and that is Revenue Canada. There are many people out there who are rather skeptical about the ability of the minister to balance the budget as he is projecting to do.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250521">There is also the habit the Conservatives have of using the unspent amount at the end of the year and applying it to the following year. That is good if there is a fairly even level of spending. However, because of the spike in spending on the action plan and the inability to spend that money in the first year, the Conservatives have created this margin, an artificial margin, that they are trying to apply. That is not going to work. The Conservatives are going to have serious problems. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250522">The reality is that this minister will have accumulated, during his term as Minister of Finance, the largest amount of debt that any minister of finance has accumulated in the history of our country.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Duncan (Edmonton—Strathcona)" id="7945491"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170183" Type="2">Ms. Linda Duncan (Edmonton—Strathcona, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3250523">Mr. Speaker, toward the end of his speech the hon. member made reference to the commercialization of education and research.

Judy Sgro (York West, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3250530">Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my colleague on his comments. He has worked very hard on many of those issues and knows them well. He, myself and others in and out of the House are clearly disappointed in the so-called budget 2013. When I look at it I do not think it is worth the paper it is written on. It is too bad that the money that went into putting out all of the books the government has done, and all of the ads that we know will come, was not put back into helping Canadians. It would have gone a lot further than producing another advertising document, which is what this is all about.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250531">Canadians coast to coast to coast are sending us emails, tweets and the rest of it about their concerns and their disappointment that there is very little in the budget, other than the recycling of a bunch of programs and initiatives.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250532">Andrew Coyne writes critically of the government and the opposition, so he is no friend of anyone except Canadians. He said that the budget is bloated, cynical and incoherent, and that, “So much of what is wrong with this budget...simply amounts to extending previous programs, or implementing past initiatives”. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250533">Even the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s favourite friend, Doug Horner, the finance minister for Alberta, said, “We don’t have any new money for these types of programs”, which the Prime Minister put into the budget. Therefore, clearly there will not be new programs because the provinces do not have the money to match them.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250534">I was also struck by the commentary from the National Citizens Coalition, a group the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> served as president. The current president, Mr. Peter Coleman, stated:</ParaText><ParaText id="3250535"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">This budget plan seeks to grab headlines for relatively minor initiatives.... [I]t is discouraging that this government was not willing to commit to more far-reaching tariff reform.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3250536">There was also an article on the front page of the business section of <I>The Globe and Mail</I> about how the tariffs that were adjusted in this budget would have a significant impact on many other avenues of resources and things that come in that have a tariff on them, to the point where it would seriously hamper many of the retailers here in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250537">Therefore, it seems that the government missed the mark again.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250538">I want to be fair with respect to a few items, such as the reduction of the tariffs on baby clothes and hockey equipment. However, the government needs to take a much more thorough look. All it does is touch those little things that will get them a bit of positive publicity and those that really needed to be touched, looked at and examined so that Canada would be better off, it did not touch at all.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250539">Canadian families now owe a record $1.67 in debt for every dollar of income. Budget 2013 would not help middle class families that are struggling. Having the minister effect changes to the interest rates would clearly affect a lot of Canadians out there who have huge mortgages and credit card debt. It was the 40-year mortgage commitment that the government made for a short period of time that certainly helped drive up the amount of debt that many Canadians are feeling.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250540">One of the issues that we all talk about here is the employment issue in and among our youth. We are facing the worst youth job market in a generation. That means that for many of our young people getting out of school there will not be jobs out there. We have been talking about this for at least two years now. What does the government suggest? It is going to invest $19 million in an advertising campaign but it will not be creating any new jobs or new skills for youth. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250541">We know how much the government likes to advertise its partisan ideas on the public dime, so I am sure we will be hearing a lot more with respect to that. By 2015, the government will have spent almost $1 billion to advance their economic inaction plan during events such as the Super Bowl. So much for the accountability and transparency that we supposedly were talking about. Everywhere we go we cannot go 50 feet without seeing another one of these economic action plan ads. Most of the people I have talked to know it is their own money that is being invested in more partisan propaganda instead of in people. The Conservatives should be ashamed of themselves every time they see those signs.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250542">Youth employment is being ignored almost as much as the job market in general. Canadians want a real plan to grow the economy and create Canadian jobs. Instead, the Conservatives are repackaging existing programs, taking more money out of the economy and calling it another action plan.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3250543">In this budget, the Conservatives have prioritized spending cuts ahead of strengthening the economy and creating new jobs. We all know that the job market is still rebounding from the recession that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> promised would never happen. We were never going to have a deficit or get into a recession. Two months later, the recession was here and they had already blown the $13 billion surplus that they had as a result of the Liberal government. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250544">Despite the assurances, young Canadians now have an employment rate that is five points worse than it was before the recession. We risk creating a lost generation of youth, unable to move out of their parents' homes, saddled with unimaginably high debt and with no meaningful job experience. Budget 2013 should have included a real plan to help young Canadians specifically, but it is not in the budget at all.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250545">Now Conservative henchmen say that budget 2013 announced infrastructure, training and manufacturing programs to kickstart the economy, but what they will not admit is that these are not new programs. The Conservatives are using budget 2013 to rebrand programs that already existed. The Liberal government introduced the gas tax some years back, and I acknowledge the fact that it was indexed and I think that is a good thing. We are always being told who voted for what, but when the Liberal government introduced that in its budget, the Conservatives, not as many as there are now, voted against the gas tax. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250546"> Today I have to say I am pleased that they indexed it, except that instead of being $5.5 billion moving forward, it has been reduced to $3.3 billion. It makes it much more difficult for municipalities to move forward. Everywhere one goes, infrastructure pressures exist. The government acknowledged it is a huge thing, but we cannot expect the cities to deal with that. The provinces are under a huge amount of debt. We say we are going to do a variety of things in partnership with them, but they do not have the money either. Nobody wants to have to raise taxes, but it is what we do with the money that we have, where our priorities lie, that matters. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250547">Budget 2013 is a hurry up and wait budget. That is what it is because the government says in five years it is going to create jobs, in five years there will be more money for infrastructure and in five years it will do a variety of things, but not today.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250548">Speaking again of the skills training issue, I am sure the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> must have been disappointed because he talked so much about how the government was going to resolve these problems and come up with solutions. All he came up with was a whole lot of hot air. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250549">Conservatives have invested a small amount, just over $1 million, to harmonize the recognition of skilled trade credentials across the country, yet they have done nothing to increase the graduation rates of apprenticeships, one of the most critical barriers to improving the supply of highly trained workers needed in Canada. Many young people end up dropping out of the apprenticeship program because they do not have enough money to keep going. Over 40% do not finish the program and investigations indicated that it is because they did not have the money to continue. Inadequate financing is a big issue, which is not addressed in the budget when we talk about the big skills shortage. We all acknowledge that we have one. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250550">Why not put the money into helping people so they can get jobs, move out of their parents' homes, buy their own homes and start investing. They cannot do it if they do not have jobs. While the government spends hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising to buy Canadians' votes, it should be thinking about the many young people looking for jobs and looking to the government for some leadership rather than passing down all kinds of ideas and deals where the provinces or companies have to match the money. A lot of them do not have the money, so I do not think these jobs are going to materialize.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250551">I am thankful for being allowed to speak about the nothing budget that I have in front of me.

I reviewed economic action plan 2013 over the weekend and saw all the great opportunities that would be made available to my riding in Kootenay—Columbia. I cannot but wonder what document the opposition is reading. Maybe the Liberals are dreaming of an NDP budget that would be full of tax increases, crippling debt and job losses in the tens of thousands. Just look at what happened to British Columbia in the dark days of the 1990s. Maybe the NDP is thinking about a Liberal budget that would cut core services like health care spending or better yet, cut spending to our military men and women so when they were sent in harms way, they were under-equipped and wearing green fatigues in a desert setting. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250566">Let us get back to reality.

If the leader of the official opposition would make a conscious effort to speak with business owners, he would know that investment by a company in identifying its priorities is key to its success. Training in trades, forestry and heavy equipment operating is in huge demand across Canada and it is industry that knows best where this needs to be applied. These people are not asking for a free hand-out. In fact, it is the exact opposite. They are looking for partners to work with them to solve a significant problem. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250576">We on this side of the House recognize that working together with industry and other levels of government in a collaborative manner would be much more productive and bring the desired results in the long run. In line with this proactive approach with industry, we will extend the temporary accelerated capital cost allowance for new investment in machinery and equipment for an additional two years for those in the manufacturing and processing sector. This will bring approximately $129 million in tax relief to growing companies and create jobs in British Columbia. In my riding, the mining and forestry sectors welcome this news. Investing in new equipment not only makes good business sense, it also increases safety and productivity.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250577">Finally, it is this Conservative government that is confirming total investments of $1.9 billion over seven years to ensure that disabled, ill and aging veterans and their families receive the support they need and deserve.

For them and the hundreds of thousands of brave men and women before them, I personally give thanks for their dedication to preserving Canada's values at home and abroad.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250578">Our Conservative government, led by <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister Stephen Harper</Affiliation>, continues to stand up for Canadians from coast to coast to coast, while we ensure that Canada remains the strongest country in the world, recognized by the G7 and G20 as a leader on all fronts.

I want to note that as a bit of a success story.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250599">We have heard about the innovative initiative put forward in economic action plan 2013 for skills training. This initiative would address the demand for skilled labour, something I have heard about many times in Mississauga South. I heard about it when we were holding pre-budget consultation meetings and local economic round table meetings. I heard about it when I met with the Port Credit BIA and small business owners, who told me that they had skilled labour shortage issues in their businesses. I heard it again when the <Affiliation DbId="165140" Type="4">Minister of State for Finance</Affiliation> spoke with Mississauga Board of Trade businesses, and the minister heard it as well.

We are talking about 130,000 people who will be helped through community colleges and other training institutions. This is good news.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250600">What I want to talk about today are the initiatives in the budget that would affect certain people who have been contacting my office, people in Mississauga South in particular. I went through the budget in search of these types of examples and found my favourite page numbers from budget 2013. I would like to tell the House what they are.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250601"> I am going to start with tax relief for home care services. Lucie Shaw in Mississauga South runs Nurse Next Door. These individuals drive around in little pink Volkswagen Beetles and help people who live in their homes. We see on page 222 that the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> has decided to expand tax relief for home care services by extending the GST and HST exemption for homemaker services to include personal care services to individuals who, due to age, infirmity or disability, require this kind of assistance at home. This change was effective last week. I am particularly pleased about that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250602">I also want to tell the House about page 243, which is a good page for two reasons. The first reason is this government will continue to support the Nature Conservancy of Canada with $20 million in 2013-14 to allow it to continue to serve ecologically sensitive land under the natural areas conservation program. Each federal dollar will be matched by $2 in new funding from other sources, leveraging additional funds for the conservation of Canada's natural environment. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3250603">The government is also working on the development of a national conservation plan, and I was a proud member of the environment committee when we studied the recommendations for the minister for the national conservation plan. It included a very strong component on urban conservation. To me and to my constituents in <Affiliation DbId="170092" Type="2">Mississauga South</Affiliation>, which sits on Lake Ontario and has the beautiful Credit River running through it as well, these kinds of initiatives to protect and conserve our environment are very important.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250604">On the same page and in the same line of thought is also a new initiative for improving the conservation of fisheries through community partnerships. Budget 2013 proposes $10 million over two years to improve the conservation of fisheries by supporting partnerships with local groups. In Mississauga South these local groups would be groups such as the Credit River Anglers Association and the Port Credit Salmon and Trout Association, which do great work in my riding. One would not think of this, because Mississauga South is obviously an urban riding and is right next to Toronto, but the constituents of my riding care very much about our lake, our river and our environment. This is a great way for this government to show what a high priority we put on conserving our natural environment.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250605">I would like to draw attention to page 226, where the topic is financial literacy for seniors. In particular, this budget will support efforts to make public awareness a priority to improve financial literacy, because sometimes older Canadians can be vulnerable to financial abuse. It will help them make more informed decisions about protecting their financial interests in the future.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250606">I sat on the Standing Committee on the Status of Women, which studied, voted on and tabled a report on elder abuse. This was one of the topics that we did not expect to come up, but financial abuse of seniors is actually quite a serious problem. In addition to improving awareness and improving financial literacy, we have also adopted Bill <Document DbId="5134895" Type="3">C-12</Document>, which helps to combat financial abuse of seniors by allowing banks to report suspected fraud to the police and other social service agencies.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250607">The Protecting Canada's Seniors Act, which received royal assent in December 2012, protects seniors better by considering age and other personal circumstances as aggravating factors in applying tougher sentences for those who take advantage of the elderly. I am proud that we are supporting our most vulnerable in society through this budget.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250608">With regard to innovation, in particular there is mention on page 201 of a business by the name of Electrovaya, which is located in Mississauga South. It was able to take advantage of Sustainable Development Technology Canada, SDTC, which the government is going to continue supporting with $325 million over eight years for the development and demonstration of new clean technologies that create efficiencies for businesses and contribute to sustainable economic development. Clean technology and efficient practices can save businesses money, create high-paying jobs, drive innovation and improve the productivity of Canada's natural resources. Electrovaya, which produces batteries for cars, energy storage and smart grid power is a great example. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250609"> I thank the Speaker for allowing me to tell the House about my favourite pages in budget 2013.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp><ParaText/></Content></Intervention><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Tremblay" id="7945776"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170236" Type="2">Mr. Jonathan Tremblay (Montmorency—Charlevoix—Haute-Côte-Nord, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3250610">Mr. Speaker, I am curious whether the member is particularly proud of the fact that her government has run a deficit since 2008, even though it promised many times to balance the budget as soon as possible.

We will perhaps give a bit of a Nova Scotia flavour of how to respond to this budget. However, there is so much to say. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250627">There is no question that the budget came down in a great deal of flurry and fanfare, but it appeared, not to overuse a phrase, that it really was a lot of smoke and mirrors. Once we began to dig down a bit, we saw the sleights of hand. However, we will not be able to get into the details until the implementation act is tabled.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250628">I want to focus a bit on the budget as it relates to my constituency and as it relates to a process I have been involved in for the past couple of years. I bring representatives from different sectors and areas in the community to share with me and with each other their thoughts, priorities, and their advice to the government on the upcoming budget. It is a wonderful experience for me, and I know it is for the people who participate. We go for three hours, and we share some very valuable information about the community and our perspectives on the nation and what the government is doing. I want to share some of that with the members.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250629">As I indicated, I held a community round table at North Woodside Community Centre in the riding of <Affiliation DbId="170644" Type="2">Dartmouth—Cole Harbour</Affiliation>. We dealt with a wide range of perspectives. We had a wonderful level of discussion and debate. We talked about trains and public transit, poverty and affordable housing, funding for local infrastructure, community organizations, regional economic development, defence procurement, environmental protection, and so much more.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250630">We also talked about how on a whole range of issues there seems to be a complete lack of consultation by the government. This was expressed across the board. Whether it is consulting the provinces, stakeholders, or first nations, the government seems not to care what ordinary Canadians have to say about these issues and therefore does not engage with them in discussions before it makes important decisions. Even in the case where the Supreme Court of Canada has said that with respect to first nations, Inuit and Métis, the Government of Canada has legal obligations to consult and accommodate them, the current government completely ignores those obligations. People are feeling that. People feel the disdain with which the government seems to hold its ideas. They see it and they feel it, and they find it quite disappointing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250631"> I was also disappointed with what I heard emanating from some of this discussion, and that is that citizens are feeling disheartened about participating in the political process. In fact, one participant went so far as to describe the government's approach to consultation as an erosion of opportunity to submit ideas. Another commented on how those who like nature have been equated by the government to being enemies of the state.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250632">I think we agree in this House, but we have to pay attention to the effect of our actions. We want citizens to be engaged in the political process by having a government that will work actively to find ways, not reduce ways, for people to participate, to voice their concerns, as well as to voice their agreement, if that happens to exist. Unfortunately, we see too often that the current government wants to hear only from people who agree with it rather than those who dissent.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250633"> I cannot tell members enough how grateful I am and have been that we have so many interested and interesting people in my community, who take the time to share their perspectives with me and with each other.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3250634">Let me now talk about why I believe the budget fails to deal with a number of items discussed at the community hall meeting that afternoon. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250635">On infrastructure, this budget commits $50 billion over 10 years in the face of Canada's current infrastructure budget, which is tagged at over $300 billion right now. It is a sleight of hand. The government is going to be spending less money over the next two years, at a time when our infrastructure is crumbling. At this time in Nova Scotia, Dartmouth and Halifax, the municipality is working desperately to maintain sewer and water lines. Those costs are being borne by taxpayers. The government needs to step up to help fund that level of infrastructure. It is deteriorating at a terrible rate, and the government is simply not putting the money forward that is needed.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250636">On trains, there was no commitment in this budget to re-establish daily trips from Montreal to Halifax. In the last year, the government cut in half the daily VIA Rail passenger service from Montreal. It has been reduced from six trips to three. We need to recognize that this is where the trip ends. The people in Halifax, whether they be students or people who would rather travel by train or they do not have a car, do not have any other options. Some would suggest that the government is focusing some attention on VIA in central Canada and forgetting about the people in Atlantic Canada. It has cut back passenger rail service through northeastern New Brunswick. Communities there have been completely abandoned. What is interesting is that at the end of February, early March, for three successive weekends, the railcars in operation were completely booked, both sleeper and passenger car services. People are disappointed that the government has not come forward to properly fund trains.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250637">On transit, Canada is still the only G8 country that does not have a national transit strategy because the Conservatives voted down the NDP motion in the House earlier this year. On poverty, poverty rates in Canada are on the rise. Instead of working with provinces to address the root causes, the government is downloading social costs onto the provinces. On regional development, one of the best ways to foster economic growth is to invest in local innovation. The Atlantic region has a wealth of innovation in areas such as agriculture and green technologies, but the government has provided no new funding to invest in these and other exciting regional industries.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250638">What New Democrats have found in this budget, and we will begin to dig into the details as we go forward, is that the government is failing to support national programs and is now funnelling money into opportunities for government members to hand out cheques. It is pork-barrelling gone mad.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250639">As I wrap up, I want to remind all members of the House that the Constitution commits all governments, provincial and federal, to promoting equal opportunities, furthering economic development, reducing regional disparities and providing essential public services to all Canadians. The federal government is not doing that. In fact, it is heading in the absolute wrong direction. We need a strong federal government that recognizes the value of all regions and all people of the country. It should pull things together and make sure there is equality of opportunity throughout this country, so we can all participate together in moving the country forward. This budget fails to achieve that.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Albrecht" id="7945866"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170525" Type="2">Mr. Harold Albrecht (Kitchener—Conestoga, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3250640">Mr. Speaker, I am rather surprised at my colleague's attitude today.

I am really pleased to rise right after my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170644" Type="2">Dartmouth—Cole Harbour</Affiliation>, who is doing an excellent job representing his constituents. I am really impressed with the way he is continually checking in with his constituents. It was great to hear their feedback today in the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250658">When I had a look at the budget, I looked first with an eye to Halifax and Atlantic Canada. I wanted to see what the government's vision was for our region. To put it quite simply, the Conservative budget fails Atlantic Canada. The Conservatives have proven once again that economic development is not a priority for them in Atlantic Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250659">What kind of economic development would I like to see? In Halifax, we have a thriving arts community, from music to theatre, to film and television, to the visual and digital arts. It is an incredible hub of talent and productivity that forms a thriving creative community in the Maritimes and a thriving creative economy. However, that economy is shut out of the budget.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250660">In budget 2013, the Conservatives refused to change the course away from the deep cuts to the arts and culture sector that they are so proud of, thereby threatening Canadian jobs and really hurting an important economic driver. On top of last year's cuts, they are slashing $42 million more from CBC, if we can even imagine that to be possible, $24 million from Canadian Heritage and $3 million from Telefilm Canada. This is a blatant attack on culture.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250661">All told, arts and culture programs will lose almost $80 million this year alone. That brings the total cuts over the past two years to over $130 million, with additional reductions to come next year. Investment in the arts and culture sector has a significant potential to bolster the Canadian economy. While other sectors have been in decline, the cultural sector has grown rapidly in the past years. There are twice as many people working in the culture sector as in forestry and more than two times as many people as working in banks.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250662">Our cultural sector adds approximately $84 billion to the Canadian economy every year. That is incredibly impressive. As my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170493" Type="2">Davenport</Affiliation> pointed out, the Conservatives love their rhetoric on the economy, but reckless moves like this prove that they just do not get that the cultural sector is an economic driver. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250663">It really is an economic driver in Halifax. We have incredible festivals, like SuperNova, East Coast Music Awards, Fringe, JazzFest, In the Dead of Winter, Nocturne, Queer Acts, ViewFinders and the Atlantic Film Festival. These are all festivals that showcase our theatre, music and visual arts and our artists. They also create a tourist destination. They bring people in, primarily from across Canada and the eastern seaboard of the U.S., and they help drive our downtown economy, supporting the hotel and restaurant industries as well. However, our growing cultural sector is not a part of Conservative Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250664">Looking at the money for infrastructure as well, the Conservatives say their plan commits $70 billion over the next 10 years, but they did not adjust for inflation. What is happening is that the amount of infrastructure funding is going down. It will be $4.7 billion lower than it was last year, and that will continue. That hurts all communities across Canada, but it has a disproportionate impact on us in Atlantic Canada as small provinces. It means we are not going to be able to address our infrastructure gap, or that we will, but these costs will be downloaded onto the provinces. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250665">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> did promise that he would not cut transfers to the provinces, but he is downloading the costs onto the provinces, which is essentially cutting transfers if they are not actually going to raise the transfers to meet the download cost. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250666">The budget pushes ahead with reckless cuts to health care to the tune of $36 billion, cuts to pensions, raising the age for OAS from 65 to 67, and with EI, making workers take a 30% pay cut, despite overwhelming opposition from Canadians. These are all areas where our provinces are going to have to make up the shortfall. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250667">I am quite proud of the Nova Scotia NDP government and its work on health care. The New Democrats have been finding efficiencies while at the same time reducing wait times. For example, their collaborative care centres have been a huge success and are being exported to other provinces, like Saskatchewan. However, it seems that Nova Scotia is being punished for our innovation in health care, because we are going to be hit extremely hard by the change in the funding formula when it comes to health care.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3250668">Speaking of EI, there is nothing in this budget to reverse the EI changes that have been hitting our region so hard, and there is nothing there for seasonal workers. The government insists that seasonal workers need to find stable employment outside of seasonal industries, but how, when this budget does not even mention ACOA? How are we supposed to foster the development of these emerging industries, or these mythical, fictional industries toward which the Conservatives keep saying we need to shift our workforce? There is no mention of ACOA and not one more dollar to support emerging businesses and innovation in Atlantic Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250669">However, the Conservative government continues to subsidize the already profitable oil and gas industry. If members can imagine, millions of dollars would go to companies like Shell, Syncrude and Enbridge. These are companies that have pretty healthy bottom lines. However, there is not one more dollar to support our companies at home in Halifax or across Atlantic Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250670">In my first-ever budget speech in the House after my election in 2008, I talked about the amazing impacts of building affordable housing in our communities. To put it quite simply, the solution to homelessness is to build affordable housing. However, investing in affordable housing does not just house people and address homelessness; it also creates jobs in the construction industry. If we make sure that the housing we build is energy efficient, we can reduce our carbon footprint at the same time. This is win-win-win, especially in times when our economy is suffering. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250671">As members know, that speech was a few years ago. Clearly the Conservatives were not listening, because not only are they not introducing a housing strategy, but homelessness funding is being reduced by $15 million a year starting in 2014. Can members imagine that is actually being reduced?</ParaText><ParaText id="3250672">Organizations in Halifax like Metro Non-Profit Housing, Adsum for Women, St. Leonard's Society and Habitat for Humanity are doing incredible work in our community, but now there is even less support for them from the federal government. As it is, they are working with practically non-existent budgets.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250673">The Out of the Cold shelter in Halifax is a perfect example of what is wrong with housing in Canada. It is serving an important role in our community as a seasonal last-resort shelter. The thing is, it is run entirely on donations and by volunteers. I am really proud of the work Out of the Cold is doing for people living in poverty in Halifax, but I am ashamed that it needs to exist. Those volunteers do their work with a critical eye. They know that they need to be there to address the gap, but they do their work knowing that the solution is to build housing. However, that solution will be even less likely to be realized after this budget from the Conservative government.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250674">I did a number of media interviews about this budget on Thursday and Friday, especially in the Maritimes. I was doing an interview with a radio show and the host said to me: “Well, we're actually looking for the story here. What is the story of the budget? It doesn't seem like there's much of a story because the budget isn't actually doing very much”.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250675">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> promised to focus on jobs, but instead he is pushing ahead with job-killing austerity cuts and is introducing no new measures to create jobs. He is basically playing a shell game with skills training money. I think that is the story. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250676">Should we not expect more from our government, such as a job creation plan, an economic development plan, a plan for a transition to the green energy economy? Should we not expect our government to have a vision to plan for the future and ensure a green and prosperous country for all, not just the well connected?</ParaText><ParaText id="3250677"> That is what I had hoped for, but with the Conservatives at the helm, I guess I should get used to disappointment.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Duncan (Edmonton—Strathcona)" id="7945888"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170183" Type="2">Ms. Linda Duncan (Edmonton—Strathcona, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3250678">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for her presentation on the budget, which is as usual bang on in speaking about her fantastic community of Halifax, the Maritime area and Canada-wide.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250679">One of the things I find gravely disappointing in this budget is that there is not a single mention of what the premier of my province of Alberta has called for, a Canadian energy strategy, nor is there any mention of support for the energy efficiency sector in which many Canadians are interested in working, particularly young Canadians.

I am pleased to see that suggestions from the people of Red Deer, which I forwarded to the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, have been heard and included in this budget. I invited constituents to submit their recommendations directly to my office. I also held round table meetings with business owners and operators in my riding. One of the main points that I heard from multiple constituents was the need for a long-term vision for public infrastructure that allows planning at the local level.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250695">Red Deer is one of the fastest growing cities. It is a hub of economic activity and has seen a significant and rapid increase in population over the past decade. This is great for the Red Deer economy but it puts a strain on public infrastructure.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250696">We will remember that in budget 2011, the government indicated that it would develop a new plan to support public infrastructure that would extend beyond the support that we have for the expiry of the 2007 building Canada plan. This was to take place in 2014. We have now come to that point and the government is delivering on its promise with a new building Canada plan beginning next year.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250697">The new building Canada plan responds to the infrastructure needs of our communities and represents the largest investment in job-creating infrastructure in the history of Canada. Investments in Canada's public infrastructure create jobs and economic growth and provide a high quality of life for families in every city and community across the country. Canada's prosperity is supported by a vast and complex network of highways and roads, water and waste water infrastructure, transit systems and recreational and cultural facilities. This network reaches into every community and touches every Canadian. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250698">In central Alberta we have seen the results of this government's investments and its co-operation with the governments of Alberta and its municipalities. The strain on our public infrastructure has been eased with projects such as the Highway 11A interchange, the resurfacing of Highway 2 from Highway 2A to Bowden and the resurfacing of the Cottonwood Road and Range Road 270.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250699">In Red Deer we have upgraded the city's traffic signal control system, the Red Deer water treatment plant and the Red Deer College campus.

We look forward to more co-operation with the Alberta government and our municipalities under the new building Canada plan.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250701">Another recurring component of my consultations with constituents continues to be taxes, whether personal income taxes, the GST or business taxes. My constituents have expressed appreciation for this government's commitment to find savings within the federal government in order to manage the country's deficit rather than raising taxes on hard-working Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250702">We know that business taxes have a significant effect on job creation. A competitive tax regime attracts businesses, increases investment in the Canadian economy and creates Canadian jobs. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250703">The temporary hiring credit for small businesses has been well received in my riding. I heard many times through my consultations with small business owners that it was something that employers felt should be continued. I am pleased that economic action plan 2013 proposed to expand and extend the temporary hiring credit for small businesses for one more year. What I have heard from small business owners in central Alberta is that this allows them to grow their operations and hire more workers.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250704">The result of our government's broad-based tax reductions are jobs, plain and simple.

We recognize the importance of apprentices to Canada's economy and the benefits of providing financial support to tradespeople and the employers that hire them. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250706">Our previous budgets have offered unprecedented support to the trades with the apprenticeship incentive grant, the apprenticeship completion grant, the tradesperson's tools deduction, the apprenticeship job creation tax credit and the extension of the tuition tax credit for occupational exam fees. There has never been a better time for Canadians to learn a skilled trade. The job market is thriving and support from this government is unwavering for Canadians, whether they are continuing to refine their skills and further their careers or they are looking to get into the exciting field of trades. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250707">Economic action plan 2013 delivers our support for skilled trades. We want to reduce barriers to accreditation in the skilled trades and to do this we have committed funding to harmonize requirements for apprentices and to examine the methods of assessment in targeted skilled trades. This will ensure that more apprentices complete their training and it will encourage mobility.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250708">In addition, we are changing our approach to procurement by introducing measures to support the use of apprentices in federal construction and maintenance contracts. The government will ensure that funds transferred to provinces and territories support the use of apprentices in infrastructure projects receiving federal funding.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250709">We are introducing the Canada job grant, which will help Canadians get the skills they need for in-demand jobs.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250710">I have experience in the registered apprenticeship program in Alberta.

Our approach is a win-win solution for workers, employers and the economy as a whole.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250711">Our government also recognizes the contributions that people with disabilities make to our economy, work that provides them with a sense of dignity and independence. Last year, we announced the panel on labour market opportunities to identify private sector successes and best practices with regard to the labour market participation of persons with disabilities. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250712">The panel consulted widely with Canadian firms of all sizes in a broad range of sectors across the country. In its report released in January of this year, “Rethinking disAbility in the private sector”, we found that many Canadians continue to have challenges regarding gainful employment. We are committed to working with provincial and territorial governments, employers and disability organizations to connect Canadians with available jobs.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250713">In economic action plan 2013 the government has committed to introduce a new generation of labour market agreements for persons with disabilities by 2014 with an investment of $222 million per year. The reformed agreements will be designed to better meet the employment needs of Canadian businesses and to improve employment prospects.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250714">We will also maintain the ongoing funding of $40 million per year for the opportunities fund for persons with disabilities and provide additional funding for the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada to support research relating to labour market participation. We believe that Canadians with disabilities have skills and we are committed to improving their employment possibilities.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250715">As a former high school teacher I know that it is important for all Canadians to have access to information on a variety of careers in order to make informed choices about their education early in life. Good choices early on can help to ensure that young Canadians obtain the skills and experience necessary to avoid unnecessary debt and to get a better start to their careers. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250716">We want to communicate with young Canadians and provide them with the information they need to know which occupations are in high demand.

This is an excellent plan that continues our government's responsible focus on creating jobs, growth and long-term prosperity. I join so many others across the country in congratulating the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> for tabling such a comprehensive document, created by a government that continues to listen, act and deliver results.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250733">Since the depth of the global economic recession, the Canadian economy has created over 950,000 net new jobs, the best record among advanced economies. Economic action plan 2013 builds on this strong foundation by taking action in areas that my constituents have been asking for, as have all Canadians. It is focused on long-term growth and prosperity by connecting Canadians with available jobs, funding infrastructure and supporting Canada's manufacturing and small business sectors. It also stays on track to balance the budget by 2015. It increases federal transfer support to high records and keeps federal taxes at their lowest level in 50 years. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250734">My constituents and local business community are especially pleased with the new Canada job grant, which will transform the way that Canadians receive skills training. We know that training in Canada is not sufficiently aligned to the skills employers need or to the jobs that are actually available. I have had businesses in my riding call to say how desperate they are for workers and ask what I can do to help. I am pleased that for the first time the Canada job grant will put skills training choices where they belong, in the hands of employers with unfilled jobs and Canadians who want to work. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250735">Under the Canada job grant, individuals may qualify for up to $15,000 to learn new skills to accept a new or better job. How significant is this? The Canadian Chamber of Commerce said, “The measures announced in today's budget” are a significant step forward in “the federal government's attack on Canada's skills challenge”.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250736">The Certified General Accountants Association of Canada said:</ParaText><ParaText id="3250737"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The government delivered a responsible budget for uncertain times.

This new infrastructure plan involves $70 billion in federal infrastructure funding over 10 years, the largest federal investment in job creating infrastructure in Canadian history. This landmark plan responds to the number one request that I heard from my constituents during my pre-budget consultations, to invest in infrastructure. It also responds to my mayor's requests for stable predictable funding while reducing the burden for local major infrastructure from the property tax rolls. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250742">The building Canada plan has a number of important components. The first is the new community improvement fund. This fund will provide $32.2 billion over 10 years in base funding for Canadian municipalities. It will index the gas tax fund and increase the GST rebate to municipalities, which can be used to build roads, public transit, recreational facilities and other community infrastructure. The gas tax fund indexing alone represents another $74,000 into Newmarket—Aurora coffers each and every year. This is on top of the $3.7 million in the federal gas tax fund that they now receive annually. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250743">The second component of the building Canada plan is the new building Canada fund. There will be $14 billion of the fund that will support major economic infrastructure projects that have a national and regional significance. The $10 billion provincial-territorial infrastructure portion will support projects of national, regional and local significance in communities across the country. This will include highways, public transit, drinking water, waster water, connectivity and broadband, and innovation</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3250744">The $10 billion provincial-territorial infrastructure portion will support projects of national, regional and local significance in communities across the country. This will include highways, public transit, drinking water, waste water, connectivity and broadband and innovation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250745">The third significant component of the new building Canada plan is the renewed P3 Canada fund: $1.25 billion will be invested and leveraged to find innovative ways to build infrastructure projects faster and to provide better value for Canadian taxpayers. Under P3 arrangements, governments continue to own the infrastructure assets, while the private sector plays a larger role in their design, construction, operation and maintenance. In doing so, the private sector assumes a greater share of project risks.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250746">The building Canada plan also allocates $6 billion in existing infrastructure funding and $17 billion to build, operate and maintain federal public infrastructure. This $70 billion in federal funding over 10 years to building or maintaining Canada's infrastructure is welcome news to my constituents.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250747">What are Canadians saying about our building Canada plan?

Economic action plan 2013 takes action in three ways to support Canada's manufacturers. It provides tax relief for new manufacturing equipment through the extension of the temporary accelerated capital allowance. It builds equipment for the Canadian armed forces. It helps Canada's manufacturers to compete through a new advanced manufacturing fund for southern Ontario, the continuation of the strategic aerospace and defence initiative, investments in forestry industry transformation and a renewed automotive innovation fund. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250751">The automotive help in particular in this budget, combined with the skills training funding, will assist key parts of <Affiliation DbId="170148" Type="2">Newmarket—Aurora</Affiliation>'s industrial base to become more competitive, thereby helping to keep our local economies strong.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250752">Economic action plan 2013 maintains our government's commitment to balancing the budget by 2015. It builds on our past efforts by announcing an additional $1.7 billion in ongoing savings from areas such as reduced travel costs through the use of technology, standardized government information systems and enhanced integrity of the tax system by closing tax loopholes to ensure that everyone pays their fair share.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250753">We are also continuing to keep taxes low for families, seniors and businesses which is very welcome news for my constituents in Newmarket—Aurora. Since 2006, we have reduced taxes over 150 times and the average family of four is paying $3,200 less in federal taxes each and every year.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250754">Seniors are also benefiting from our low tax plan, paying on average $2,200 less in taxes each year. I have had many residents thank me for our actions to keep more money in the pockets of people.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250755">There are so many other ways that economic action plan helps everyday Canadians that I cannot possibly mention them all.

Instead of tackling the problem of unemployment and recognizing the diversity of the Canadian economy, the Conservatives would rather attack unemployed workers and small businesses.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250786">Here I am, once again, talking about something that is making a lot of people in the country unhappy, and that is employment insurance reform.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250787">Over the past few months and weeks, the major unions in Quebec, groups that advocate on behalf of workers and citizens, and municipal and rural organizations have come together to protest the changes that have been made to employment insurance. This is a testament to broad consensus in Quebec against this reform, a consensus that is also found outside the province.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250788">On February 15, the executive committee of the Union des municipalités du Québec, the UMQ, adopted a resolution calling on the federal government to suspend EI reforms until economic impact studies have been completed. We know full well, such studies were not conducted before the reform was implemented.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3250789">In short, we might as well say that the government is putting policies in place without having any idea about where it is going or about the potential consequences on the daily lives of Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250790">All these Canadian organizations, which condemn the reform and now form a true coalition, are already trying to reason with the federal government so that it will suspend the implementation of this reform's ridiculous and arbitrary measures.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250791">The government must immediately conduct impact studies on the changes it wants to bring about, it must release the results of those studies, and it must hold public consultations on the subject. These measures target workers and the most vulnerable sectors, and will most certainly have a negative impact on future generations.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250792">According to Éric Forest, president of the UMQ and mayor of Rimouski, a beautiful region in the Gaspé Peninsula, this reform will affect the social and economic fabric of the regions. Seasonal workers and their families will have to move away from the regions to work. These regions will therefore lose skilled workers, and entire families will have to leave. Years of effort to boost the regions' vitality through policies and programs will be wasted.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250793">The UMQ also pointed out that seasonal employment is part of the economic reality of many regions and contributes to the development of a number of sectors that are essential to the economy of Quebec, including agriculture, forestry, fishing, tourism and even film.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3250794">By impoverishing and emptying the regions of their skilled workers, employment insurance reform will lead to labour shortages for many businesses, which will have a devastating impact on all regions of Quebec. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250795">The regions feel that these changes are a direct attack—pure and simple—on regional economies. It is bad for workers and employees. In what way is this reform positive? It is bad for the unemployed and their families. The government should address job creation issues and recognize the diversity of our country's economy instead of going after the unemployed and small businesses.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250796">I will repeat my question. Why is the minister not listening to Canadians? Why is it not cancelling the devastating employment insurance reform?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

			<SubjectOfBusiness id="7945977"><SubjectOfBusinessQualifier>Public Safety</SubjectOfBusinessQualifier><SubjectOfBusinessContent><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. May" id="7945961"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170542" Type="2">Ms. Elizabeth May (Saanich—Gulf Islands, GP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3250812">Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening in adjournment proceedings to pursue a question that I initially asked on February 4 of this year. It relates to the mysterious case of Dr. Arthur Porter, as I referred to it at the time. I have asked questions on previous occasions, and on that occasion I asked the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> a question and the response came from the <Affiliation DbId="147112" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation>. I asked why Dr. Porter is still a member of Privy Council, which is the highest level of trust within the government, an individual who is able to access all government secrets.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250813">At the time I did not realize there was more to this story than I knew on February 4. For instance, my question to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> included the question as to whether normal background checks were suspended. I asked how Dr. Porter was approved for these very sensitive positions. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250814">What I have learned since then, through a number of access to information requests, is that although the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act requires that all leaders of parties with more than 12 members in the House get to review appointments, my assumption was that leaders of other parties had not raised an objection. They, like the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, were unaware there was anything suspicious in Dr. Porter's background and that somehow the background checks fell apart.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3250815">What I was surprised to discover is that one of the leaders of one of the official parties in the House at the time, not once but twice, objected to Dr. Porter. The member objected, when in 2008 he was made a member of the Canadian Security Intelligence Review Committee, and in 2010 objected when Dr. Porter was named chairman of the very important Canadian Security Intelligence Review Committee.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3250816">How could this have happened? Who was that member? Now that he no longer sits in the House, I can use his proper name. It was the leader of the Bloc Québécois, Gilles Duceppe. Gilles Duceppe, in his first letter dated February 2, 2008, to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, which I am going to repeat in English, said “Regarding the appointment of Arthur T. Porter...I wish to draw the following to your attention...”. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250817">He proceeded to draw to the Prime Minister's attention the problems that occurred when Dr. Porter was at the Detroit Medical Center. Mr. Duceppe lists them as conflicts of interest, mismanagement, financial crises, threats of bankruptcy, and so forth, and refers the Prime Minister to an article in <I>Le Devoir</I>. He also mentioned that it had been reported that Dr. Porter regarded himself as a close friend of former U.S. president George Bush and former vice president Cheney. Mr. Duceppe thought that such a close relationship with foreign powers, previous leaders, would represent a conflict of interest in his loyalties to Canada by being in such a sensitive post. In 2010, when the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> sought to elevate Dr. Porter to chair of the committee, Monsieur Duceppe repeated his concerns.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3250818">Again, I remain baffled. In every answer from Conservative members of Parliament to questions about Dr. Porter, we are told only two things: he is now basically escaping prosecution for his transgressions by hiding out in the Caribbean, and that these allegations had nothing to do with the fact that he is a Privy Council officer nor that he was chairman of the Canadian Security Intelligence Review Committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250819">My questions are very simple. Is Dr. Porter still a Privy Council officer? Our information is that he is. Where were the background checks? More specifically, why did the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> choose to ignore very clear and specific warnings from the leader of the Bloc Québécois, Mr. Duceppe, who raised these very issues. We now see that Dr. Porter was a spectacularly poor choice to be in possession of this country's secrets.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="00">(1900)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Answer" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Bergen" id="7945963"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170861" Type="18">Ms. Candice Bergen (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Safety, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3250820">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170542" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation> for her interest in this. I want to assure the member that the allegations relating to Mr. Porter have absolutely nothing to do with the work he did as a member of the Security Intelligence Review Committee. There has been no suggestion whatsoever of any improper handling or disclosure of confidential information.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250821">Prior to his appointment, Mr. Porter was subject to a series of security background checks coordinated by officials from the Privy Council Office. These checks were robust and included police, security and financial records. The government consulted with both the leader of the New Democratic Party and the leader of the Liberal Party. As the member is aware, Mr. Porter offered his resignation in 2011 and the government accepted it.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250822">The allegations that Mr. Porter is currently facing do not have anything to do with his former responsibilities. The government has taken this opportunity, however, to strengthen the screening process as we feel that is important. Prospective Security Intelligence Review Committee members are now vetted in the same way as all other government officials who require access to highly-sensitive information through a clearance conducted by CSIS, in addition to a pre-appointment background check. This includes consideration of people with whom the prospective members are closely associated and connected with.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3250823">Importantly, CSIS does not assess individuals' qualifications to serve as members of the Security Intelligence Review Committee, also called SIRC, only their loyalty to Canada and their reliability. In addition, as part of new procedures, CSIS provides the results of its checks to the Privy Council Office, which, in consultation with the government, retains responsibility for deciding whether to appoint the individual. In this way, the independence of SIRC is preserved, which is incredibly important for all of us.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250824">As the hon. member may know, in June 2012 the government appointed Chuck Strahl to replace Mr. Porter as chair of the Security Intelligence Review Committee. Mr. Strahl was subject to these new security measures.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250825">We believe the steps we have taken in this matter have strengthened the screening process. They ensure the continued robustness and integrity of the process, as well as the protection of confidential government information.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I know it is fairly theoretical because he is not in Ottawa, where would he get access to our secrets, but it is certainly not appropriate for him to remain a Privy Council officer.</ParaText><ParaText id="3250829">My second question is this. Why was it that these very clear concerns put forward by Gilles Duceppe were ignored in the process that occurred in appointing Dr. Porter first as a member of SIRC and then as a chairperson of it? I think Canadians want to know. </ParaText><ParaText id="3250830">I am glad to see that Chuck Strahl has taken the reins. I do not think there is anyone I respect more than Chuck Strahl.
