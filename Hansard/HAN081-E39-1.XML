					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Ablonczy" id="1775836"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78945" Type="18">Ms. Diane Ablonczy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="267340">Mr. Speaker, today we are at third and final reading of Bill <Document DbId="2374081" Type="3">C-25</Document>. The bill is entitled Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act. The bill proposes amendments to the existing act against money laundering and terrorist financing. These amendments will toughen Canada's existing anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="267341">We are aware and we applaud the fact that we are more and more a global economy, that all countries interact together to do what they do best in the global marketplace, and that open borders provide these kinds of opportunities for Canadian businesses to thrive internationally.</ParaText><ParaText id="267342">However, every upside has certain downsides. This kind of openness in commerce, trade and financial transactions around the world also provides criminals with opportunities. Criminals use these opportunities to launder millions of dollars in illegal cash. The intention of criminal and terrorist elements, of course, is to make these proceeds look legitimate, so they can use them without attracting the unwelcome attention of law enforcement agencies. The funds are also increasingly used to fund terrorist activities. We want to put a stop to this.</ParaText><ParaText id="267343">Criminal activities, I do not have to remind the House, undermine the reputation and integrity of financial institutions. They distort the operation of financial markets and adequate measures must be put in place to deter this kind of activity.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267344">I want to remind all members, although we have spoken about this issue before, that the proposed legislation is extremely important to our country. I want to take a few minutes to explain briefly what money laundering and terrorist financing is, how it operates, and especially how it can affect our Canadian economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="267345">Money laundering is the process used by criminals to disguise the source of money and assets derived from criminal activity. This kind of criminal activity is very broad. It runs from drug trafficking, prostitution, smuggling, fraud, extortion, corruption, to criminal activity of all kinds. Most of this activity generates large quantities of cash, untraceable cash, but cash nevertheless, that can raise suspicions of law enforcement agencies. Criminals turn to money laundering and they have to use legitimate financial institutions and systems to do this. This can compromise the integrity of these institutions. It can also facilitate corruption in a country. It can destabilize economies. It is a serious threat to any country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267346">This kind of criminal activity is nothing new. It has been around for a long time in one form or another. However, there has been a change recently. Money laundering has become an increasingly global phenomenon. This is because of technological advances in e-commerce and the global diversification of financial markets. Because of this, criminals now use very sophisticated techniques to carry out these money laundering activities. These techniques can lead to further opportunities to launder illegal profit and obscure the money trail leading back to underlying crime.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp><ParaText id="267347">Methods for laundering funds vary considerably and are often highly sophisticated and intricate. However, there are generally three basic stages to the process. I mentioned this before to the House, but some members may not have heard it so I will just repeat it quickly. </ParaText><ParaText id="267348">First, there is the placement stage. This involves placing the proceeds of crime, usually in small amounts at a time, into the financial system. </ParaText><ParaText id="267349">Placement is followed by layering. At this second stage, the dirty money is converted into another form through complex layers of financial transactions that disguise the audit trail and disguise the source and ownership of funds. This, for example, can be by buying and selling stocks or by buying and selling commodities or properties. These are some common vehicles for layering.</ParaText><ParaText id="267350">Finally, there is the integration stage and in this stage the laundered proceeds are placed back into the economy, hidden under a veil of legitimate business activity.</ParaText><ParaText id="267351">Terrorist financing has an extra wrinkle to all of this because it can involve funds that have been raised from legitimate sources. Unlike organized crime, terrorists can raise funds through legitimate sources such as personal donations, profits from business, or through charitable organizations. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267352">Terrorist financing can also come from funds that have been through the money laundering process that I have just described, that is, it could come from criminal sources such as the drug trade, smuggling weapons and other goods, fraud, kidnapping, extortion, all of these criminal activities in addition to legitimate activities.</ParaText><ParaText id="267353">Terrorists, like criminal organizations, use sophisticated money laundering techniques to evade the attention of authorities. However, to make the money harder to follow, financial transactions associated with terrorist financing tend to be in smaller amounts than in the case with money laundering by criminal organizations. When terrorists raise funds from legitimate sources, members of the House can appreciate that the detection and tracking of those particular funds becomes very difficult.</ParaText><ParaText id="267354">To move their funds out of our country or another country, terrorists often use informal money transfer systems such as Hawalas. These exist and operate outside of, or parallel to, what we normally think of as traditional banking or financial channels. </ParaText><ParaText id="267355">In Canada, in an effort to conceal the final destination of laundered money, FINTRAC is finding that funds suspected of being used for financing terrorist activities are increasingly being moved out of the country through traditional banking centres to countries with major financial hubs.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267356">How big is this money laundering and terrorist financing problem? What are we dealing with? What do we need to be aware of? Because this is hidden activity, it is pretty hard to put an actual dollar figure on it. We do know that this activity involves significant amounts of money. The International Monetary Fund, through its expert sources, has estimated that worldwide the aggregate size of money laundering is between 2% and 5% of the entire global GDP. That is very significant by any standard.</ParaText><ParaText id="267357">What can we do about it? The bottom line is that criminal and terrorist activity requires money. One of the best ways to put these individuals out of business is to starve them of funds. That is why we are here today with Bill <Document DbId="2374081" Type="3">C-25</Document>. The bill would improve Canada's ability to act decisively and shut down these criminal operations when they are detected.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp><ParaText id="267358">We have already taken some steps in this direction. Members will recall that in the recent spring budget there was extra funding for key partners in combating this kind of activity of money laundering and terrorist financing. There is $64 million in additional funding over the next two years for the RCMP, the Department of Justice, the Canada Border Services Agency and FINTRAC. </ParaText><ParaText id="267359">Just a reminder for those who are wondering, FINTRAC is Canada's financial intelligence unit. It is an integral part of our country's commitment to fight money laundering and terrorist activity financing. FINTRAC gathers information about financial transactions, analyzes it and if it sees something suspicious alerts our security forces to take further action.</ParaText><ParaText id="267360">As the finance minister said when he introduced this bill that is before us today, “Canada's new Government will continue to be relentless in its battle against money laundering and terrorism financing”. </ParaText><ParaText id="267361">To build on the measures in the budget to increase funding for these kinds of security activities by the RCMP and CSIS, Bill <Document DbId="2374081" Type="3">C-25</Document> will help ensure that Canada continues to be a global leader in combating organized crime and terrorist financing.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267362">It will do that by making our financing regime consistent with new standards that were recently adopted by the financial action task force. Members will know that the FATF is an international standard setting body for developing and promoting national and international policies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.</ParaText><ParaText id="267363">We are proud of the fact that Canada was a founding member of this organization. I commend the previous government for the leadership that Canada took in this area. </ParaText><ParaText id="267364">Canada is committed to implementing the 40 new recommendations of the FATF on money laundering and nine special recommendations on terrorist financing. Canada's response to those revised recommendations have been put into law in the bill we are debating today. </ParaText><ParaText id="267365">The bill also responds to the Auditor General. In 2004 the Auditor General made some recommendations about how to strengthen our regime. We want to respond positively to her recommendations. In 2004 there was a Treasury Board evaluation of our regime. Treasury Board made some recommendations which we want to put into place as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="267366">Recently, the Auditor General appeared before the House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance. The Auditor General has confirmed to the committee, and I would like to let the House know, that this bill in the Auditor General's opinion appears to deal with the key findings in the report from the Auditor General's Office in November 2004.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267367">Not only that, we have recently received a report from the Senate Standing Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce. The Senate committee undertook an extensive study of this whole area of money laundering and terrorist financing. The report called for a number of tougher measures to deal with these activities. </ParaText><ParaText id="267368">Those of us in the House want to thank the Senate committee members for the insights that they have provided on this issue. They are satisfied and pleased I believe, although they will be examining this bill in some detail in the days to come, that their proposed recommendations have been enshrined in this legislation and in related regulations.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp><ParaText id="267369">The following are the key proposals in this legislation. First, there is something new in the area of information sharing. Right now, FINTRAC shares information with law enforcement and other domestic and international agencies. This bill would enhance that information sharing in ways that were recommended by the Auditor General and also requested by law enforcement agencies.</ParaText><ParaText id="267370">Specifically, this would enhance the information FINTRAC can disclose to law enforcement and security agencies on suspicious and money laundering terrorist financing. It is not much good for FINTRAC to have this information if it cannot alert those who could actually investigate it further and do something about it.</ParaText><ParaText id="267371">Second, the bill deals with the registration system. It proposes to create a system to register money service businesses and foreign exchange dealers. Previously, these entities were not registered and, because they also have been conduits for money laundering, they will now be brought into the system.</ParaText><ParaText id="267372">With a federal registration system in place for individuals and entities engaged in money service businesses of foreign exchange, FINTRAC would act as registrar and would maintain a public list of registered money service businesses and foreign exchange dealers.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267373">Third, the bill deals with enhanced client identification measures. It would include requirements for reporting entities, banks, insurance companies, securities dealers and money services businesses to undertake enhanced monitoring of high risk situations. In other words, we are heightening the level of vigilance in our country. This would include the monitoring of transactions of foreign nationals who hold prominent public positions.</ParaText><ParaText id="267374">The current legislation only allows for serious criminal penalties if the act is contravened. In order to take a more balanced and gradual approach to compliance, the bill would allow FINTRAC to levy fines to deal with lesser contraventions or inadvertent breaches of the act. It would also provide FINTRAC with the ability to create an administrative and monetary penalty system whereby fines can be applied for non-compliance. This would better help FINTRAC to do its work.</ParaText><ParaText id="267375">For those who have made inquiries about this, the regulations for this bill would also include other reporting entities, such as gemstone and precious metals dealers they deal with, and compliance measures that are appropriate to legal practitioners. Discussions are underway with the building industry.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267376">Not only the government but the entire House is very serious about winning the battle against money laundering and terrorist financing. I would like to commend all members of the House from all parties for their united determination to get behind these measures. There has been a very good level of cooperation from all parties in bringing the bill forward and that will benefit all Canadians. Canadians should commend all parties for this cooperation. As Mr. Speaker knows, that does not always happen in the House but, on important issues, members of Parliament can act in a united way.</ParaText><ParaText id="267377">For the first time ever, the House should know that Canada has assumed the presidency of the FATF. We are very pleased about the leadership role we will have in this area. Our presidency of the FATF is another example of our commitment to national and international security, to collaborative solutions to global threats and to meeting the need for international cooperation and international institutions to deal with this area.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp><ParaText id="267378">The bill would make Canada's overall regime consistent with international standards. It would continue to help us keep one step ahead of those who would abuse our system to fund criminal and international terrorist activities. </ParaText><ParaText id="267379">We appreciate the fact that we have all party support for this. I would tell Canadians that they can be reassured that the government, the House of Commons and Canada's Parliament are dealing with this important issue in an expeditious and effective manner.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

John McCallum (Markham—Unionville, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="267380">Mr. Speaker, given the gracious words of my colleague, the parliamentary secretary, not only commending the previous government for introducing FINTRAC but also for praising the unelected Senate for its positive role in this area, I hesitate to ask a question that could in any way be construed to be critical.</ParaText><ParaText id="267381">However, duty does require me to mention the issue of parliamentary oversight, which, as a consequence of Liberal amendments, supported by the other opposition parties, are now part of the bill, and yet the Conservatives opposed the principle of parliamentary oversight in committee. Once that principle had been passed, we worked together to ensure the appropriate form of parliamentary oversight.</ParaText><ParaText id="267382">I would like to ask the parliamentary secretary why the government opposed the principle of parliamentary oversight for FINTRAC.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Ms. Ablonczy" id="1775956"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78945" Type="18">Ms. Diane Ablonczy</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="267383">Mr. Speaker, the government did no such thing. I am sorry that partisanship must always rear its ugly head. All members of Parliament are very concerned about ensuring that the privacy of Canadians and the accountable operation of these kinds of activities are jealously protected.</ParaText><ParaText id="267384">There was a proposal for oversight that simply was not workable. It would have substantially changed the operations of some of the organizations that do important work on behalf of Canadians in protecting their security. However, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> put a proposal forward for oversight, through the office of the Information Commissioner, a proposal that had also been brought to my attention by the members of the Bloc Québécois. We were able to achieve consensus behind that area of oversight.</ParaText><ParaText id="267385">As I emphasized, all members of Parliament and certainly the government are very committed to oversight, which is why we introduced the federal accountability act, an act that would broaden, to an unprecedented degree, oversight of all operations of government. </ParaText><ParaText id="267386">We are very grateful that there has been consensus behind this important measure in Bill <Document DbId="2374081" Type="3">C-25</Document>.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

John McKay (Scarborough—Guildwood, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="267387">Mr. Speaker, I just want to question the parliamentary secretary one step further. </ParaText><ParaText id="267388">My recollection of the events was that the opposition introduced the motion and the motion was to the effect that there would be parliamentary oversight. The motion was passed. My hon. colleague asked why the government opposed having parliamentary oversight imposed on a bill that, and pretty well everyone in the chamber would agree, imposes a significant intrusion into the privacy of transactions and affairs of Canadians.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="30">(1030)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Ms. Ablonczy" id="1775966"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78945" Type="18">Ms. Diane Ablonczy</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="267389">Mr. Speaker, I am very puzzled by this line of questioning from the Liberals opposite. The motion, to which both of my friends in the Liberal Party referred, had nothing to do with parliamentary oversight. In fact, the motion would have made oversight by SIRC, which is not a parliamentary body. It is a body that was never intended to do this kind of work. It was intended to have very vigorous oversight over the invasive investigative capacity by entities like the RCMP and CSIS, not an information gathering body like FINTRAC. </ParaText><ParaText id="267390">The members are well aware that this would have been a serious disruption of SIRC's important work. It would have been inappropriate for SIRC to take on a completely different role in oversight for FINTRAC, which is why the finance minister put forward a more suitable and effective, I might say, method of oversight by Parliament through the Information Commissioner who reports directly to Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="267391"> I do not know why my friends over there are being mischievous but I hope the House realizes that any resistance by the government was not to oversight at all. We certainly want oversight and have put a very strong oversight regime in place with the help of all parties.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267392">What was not appropriate was to make SIRC responsible for that oversight and, at the end of the day, I think we would all agree.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

					<Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. McCallum (Markham—Unionville)" id="1775987"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78387" Type="2">Hon. John McCallum</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="267397">Mr. Speaker, whether the House has agreed because the members look forward to hearing my colleague or because they have less time to listen to me, either way they have accepted and I thank them all.</ParaText><ParaText id="267398">We on this side of the House certainly support the bill. Indeed, to a large degree, the bill is based on recommendations by the Department of Finance when we were in government, so we certainly agree with the bill as amended.</ParaText><ParaText id="267399">It is clear that money laundering and terrorist financing have economic and social costs against which we must remain forever vigilant. It is true that we have to seek out this activity in all corners of the world, because if there are corners that we neglect, that is where the criminals and the terrorist financing people will go.</ParaText><ParaText id="267400">It is clear as well that this kind of legislation has to be continuously reviewed and updated, because in a sense there is a technological race between the terrorists and the money launderers on the one hand and the government on the other. They, of course, are always trying to be one step ahead of the regulators in terms of the technologies and the techniques they use, so we must be involved in this never-ending racing to be ahead of them. I believe that on the whole the bill does make significant improvements and significant progress to this end, an end which I am sure all of us in this House would share.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267401">I would also like to point out, as the parliamentary secretary did, that we were influenced to a significant extent by the good work in the Senate, led by Senator Grafstein, and its report entitled, “Stemming the Flow of Illicit Money - A Priority for Canada”. It is nice to hear praise from the Conservative Party for the good work of the Senate, so I do thank those members for that, but it is also clear that this report made several excellent recommendations, some but not all of which were included in this bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="267402">One of the areas where the Senate made a good recommendation, which was not accepted, was that the report urged the government to have precious metal and jewellery dealers report large transactions to FINTRAC. This was not in the original bill. This is an open door. Criminals are not stupid. If the cash is covered but the jewellery or the diamonds are not, they can use diamonds instead of cash. I think this is one of the loopholes that this bill ought to have covered off, but it failed to do so.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267403">Nobody wants to put undue burdens on Canadian businesses, and yes, having to report these transactions to FINTRAC is another burden for the businesses involved, but if these types of businesses are identified by the criminal element as safe places to launder money, then that is where they may choose to go. I do think that this is a significant deficiency.</ParaText><ParaText id="267404"> Indeed, my colleague, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78624" Type="2">Saint-Léonard—Saint-Michel</Affiliation>, did propose amendments at committee that would have brought precious metal and jewellery dealers into the legislation. Unfortunately, these amendments were found to be out of order by the chair because they were said to be beyond the scope of the bill. When the bill is updated, I hope that this is one area that will be covered off in future amendments.</ParaText><ParaText id="267405">There is also the very important issue of privacy and parliamentary oversight. I believe the original bill provided a delicate balance between two good things. On the one hand, the bill has to be tough in its ability to go after money launderers and people involved in terrorist financing. On the other hand, the bill has to protect the privacy rights of Canadians. I believe the original bill had a delicate balance between these two sometimes competing objectives.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp><ParaText id="267406">The new bill correctly strengthens the enforcement side of this equation. We on this side of the House agreed with those measures, but we also think that in order to retain balance, if we strengthen the enforcement side we should also ask the question of whether the side of privacy or the protection of individual rights should also be strengthened. </ParaText><ParaText id="267407">That is why, right from the beginning, our party, and I believe the other opposition parties, sought to bring parliamentary oversight into the equation, parliamentary oversight being absent from the original bill and from the bill put forward by the government. Throughout the committee hearings, the government side did not display an interest in any form of parliamentary oversight. It was satisfied with the status quo.</ParaText><ParaText id="267408"> Then, at committee, the Liberal side brought in an amendment, based on the work of the Senate committee, to provide oversight by SIRC, but with annual reports to Parliament, and this is the point the parliamentary secretary neglected . This, for the first time, would have brought in the principle of annual parliamentary oversight, which was absent from the previous bill and absent from the government's bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="267409"> The record will show that four Conservative hands went up to vote against our amendment in terms of whether it was in order. It was only when the opposition together combined to bring forward this amendment that the government accepted the principle of parliamentary oversight.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267410">I repeat the point that I made in my question and comment. The government opposed the principle of parliamentary oversight of FINTRAC. Once we introduced our amendment, we had further discussions and agreed with the government side that its alternative form of parliamentary oversight through the Privacy Commissioner rather than SIRC was acceptable. </ParaText><ParaText id="267411">The main reason why I agreed that this was all right and an improvement was that I consulted Senator Grafstein, the person who originally had recommended parliamentary oversight through SIRC. He thought this was a reasonable proposal by the government, so we on this side accepted that proposal, as did the opposition parties.</ParaText><ParaText id="267412">That does not negate my central point that parliamentary oversight is important for FINTRAC. There is plenty of scope for individual privacy to be put in jeopardy. The government side had to be dragged kicking and screaming to accept this principle only after the three opposition parties combined to force the issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="267413">That having been said, I will say that this side of the House does support the bill. We are certainly the creators of this institution. We believe it is necessary. We believe that it has to be updated continuously. My principal reservations are on the diamonds and the jewellery, which is work still to be done in the future, and the parliamentary oversight that the government was forced to accept is also an important part of this amended bill.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Unfortunately, rules prohibit me from showing members this chart, Mr. Speaker, but you would find it incredibly complex and incredibly detailed, following money from one bank account in Kingston. I am sure there are no terrorist or other kinds of suspicious activities going on in Kingston, but it was just a theoretical possibility that there might be. It follows the money from there to other countries, coming back into our country, going off into a country like the United States, then going off to another country, and then ultimately being used for terrorist-like or terrorist activities. Just following the chart was incredibly complex. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267417">The Senate did a very able report on this legislation and, as I have said, made particular recommendations with respect to the legal profession, which was a bit of a gap in the previous legislation. I think that members on both sides of the House are somewhat satisfied that, with negotiations with the law societies of Canada, we have addressed that gap.</ParaText><ParaText id="267418">I would like to read for members from the views expressed by the senators:</ParaText><ParaText id="267419"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">--in their view, solicitors should be subject to the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act. The Department of Finance told us that it “understands(s) (that the absence of coverage of the legal profession) is a serious gap in (Canada's) regime...Certainly the Auditor General has identified it and reinforced that point.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="267420">I want to commend the government for working on this issue. I know that in our government we were continuing to work on this particular issue, because it does pit this against a fundamental right of Canadians to assume that when they consult with their solicitor, their barrister or their legal representative they have a confidentiality that cannot be breached.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267421">The Department of Justice told the committee that this was a great difficulty and that the imposition on lawyers would “fundamentally violate the right to counsel, solicitor-client privilege or even fundamental justice”. The RCMP commented that “the exclusion of the legal profession poses a significant gap in Canada's regime”. The Canadian General Accountants Association said “the biggest mistake made was...when the lawyers were not included”.</ParaText><ParaText id="267422">All members of the committee and all sides of the House actually agreed with those observations, I think, and in some measure the government has actually addressed that issue in the bill. What does concern me is taking it from 35,000 feet down to the average lawyer's office, so to speak. I will use my own community in Scarborough as an example.</ParaText><ParaText id="267423"> As members know, particularly in real estate offices, lawyers flush a lot of money through their trust accounts over the course of a day, particularly over a heavy closing day. There is still some lingering concern. I hope that as this bill gains experience, so to speak, or some precedents, there will be some fleshing out with respect to what constitutes a suspicious transaction.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="45">(1045)</Timestamp><ParaText id="267424">I do not recollect whether you practised law, Mr. Speaker, but I did. There were times when people would ask me do a particular transaction for them. Frequently, I did not know them, but they could produce identification. </ParaText><ParaText id="267425">The newspapers have recently reported stories about solicitors who have been taken in by fraudulent mortgage transactions, and it is a relatively easy thing to do. Let me use Mr. Jones as an example.</ParaText><ParaText id="267426"> Mr. Jones gets a commitment from a bank. His lawyer innocently does what the bank has requested him to do. The lawyer prepares the documents, searches the title, gets the insurance in order, checks the taxes, et cetera. Mr. Jones then signs the documents and the lawyer advances the funds to him. A few months later Mrs. Smith, who is the real owner of the house, finds out that Mr. Jones has put a mortgage on her property and she now owes a huge amount of money to the bank. This is a relatively easy fraud to perpetrate upon the real estate system. The solicitor is just as much a victim as Mrs. Smith. There really is no way the solicitor can know who Mr. Jones really is.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267427">The regime for the FINTRAC legislation contemplates that the lawyer knows his or her client. Having practised law for 20 years, that in theory sounds pretty good. At 35,000 feet that sounds pretty good. However, for a solicitor, that will be somewhat more difficult. The way I read the legislation, the lawyer will have a liability for the kind of transaction I just described to the House, which is fraud. It is a very important fraud to the person who owns the property, but there is no necessary connection to terrorist activities or money laundering or things of that nature. The Ontario government has had to move against these kinds of transactions.</ParaText><ParaText id="267428"> I am a bit from Missouri with respect to so-called suspicious transactions. Suspicious transactions will be in the eye of the beholder. Does a law office get into things like profiling? For example, because a person is from a certain area of the world the lawyer should be more suspicious of the transaction that he or she asks the lawyer to do. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267429">Are we going to get into other kinds of client identification? If an individual cannot produce a birth certificate showing he or she was born in Canada but can produce a resident visa or something of that nature, does this constitute a suspicious issue? Will lawyers be required to know their clients even better? Once the cheque is written by the solicitor pursuant to the completion of the transaction, how will he or she know that money will not be used for terrorist activities? How will a lawyer determine that a transaction is suspicious and needs to be reported?</ParaText><ParaText id="267430">At 35,000 feet, the legislation sounds like a good idea. Our party, the government and the other opposition parties support it. However, I am a little skeptical about how a solicitor in Scarborough, for example, can sufficiently protect himself or herself against the implications of this kind of transaction. How will the lawyer determine whether an individual or a transaction is suspicious? How will the lawyer determine whether the individual has provided real identification that will enable the lawyer to do a proper reporting?</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp><ParaText id="267431">I work on the assumption that if people are admitted to the bar, they are officers of the court and they have a fiduciary duty to not only their clients but a larger duty to society as well. I also work on the presumption that lawyers are not complicit in these kinds of transactions.</ParaText><ParaText id="267432">Members of the Liberal Party support the legislation. We look forward to the review of it by our Senate colleagues. We thank them for their work, under the chairmanship of Senator Jerry Grafstein, and appreciate any insights they may have with respect to any parts of the bill.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The Bloc Québécois will support this bill, as it has indicated and as it has always supported sound bills.</ParaText><ParaText id="267434">The Bloc Québécois has a history of fighting against crime. Hon. members will recall the work done in 1993 by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78381" Type="2">Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot</Affiliation> with regard to people who were growing marijuana in fields in Saint-Hyacinthe and farmers throughout Quebec. It was a tough battle, which the member for <Affiliation DbId="78381" Type="2">Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot</Affiliation> led very energetically.</ParaText><ParaText id="267435">We have also talked about the reversal of the burden of proof with respect to proceeds of crime. This is a great victory by the Bloc Québécois. The Bloc Québécois has also helped toughen anti-gang legislation, making it easier for police to fight organized crime gangs. Our commitment to fighting crime extends to money laundering and international terrorism. That is why the Bloc will support this bill.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267436">When I spoke for the first time about this bill in this House, I said that I would be taking a close look at privacy issues. I am fairly happy with what this bill does. We had discussions earlier in this House, and we also had discussions in committee about how we can fight effectively against crime and terrorist financing and yet protect people's privacy. I want to personally make sure that the bill does not have any loopholes. I am very happy that all the parties have reached agreement on this.</ParaText><ParaText id="267437"> I would like to explain how FINTRAC works. This agency collects financial data on transactions in Canada and abroad and will continue to do so. Under this bill, more data will be collected and more companies will be required to disclose information to FINTRAC so that it can do its job properly.</ParaText><ParaText id="267438">To understand how this works, hon. members need to know that FINTRAC does not conduct investigations. It is not an investigating body, but an agency that gathers and analyzes information and passes it on to the proper authorities. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267439">With respect to collecting information, the legislation provides that banks and insurance companies, as well as other financial institutions and organizations, must report a certain number of transactions to FINTRAC. Obviously, we are talking about large transactions that involve a lot of money. Any transaction that appears odd or suspicious must be reported and added to the FINTRAC database. </ParaText><ParaText id="267440">Then the information is analyzed. Analysts look for connections that suggest some kind of fraud has been committed. They use two techniques to do this. The first is searching the data for patterns in the volume of financial transactions, which makes it possible to spot activities typical of people attempting to launder money or finance terrorist activities. Clearly, it makes sense to centralize this information.<I></I></ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="55">(1055)</Timestamp><ParaText id="267441">It makes sense because a single transaction might appear quite ordinary, but finding connections among series of transactions can alert analysts to suspect illegal activity. </ParaText><ParaText id="267442">The first way to detect illegal activity is to analyze the data collected in order to identify typical patterns.</ParaText><ParaText id="267443">The second is voluntary disclosure by entities, police forces or security forces that suspect illegal activity.

The reality is that none of the data collected by FINTRAC can be accessed directly by police, the intelligence service, the secret service or other agencies. </ParaText><ParaText id="267738">These agencies may, however, voluntarily disclose information. For example, someone might say they are with the RCMP and that they are investigating so and so, who is suspected of laundering money in one financial institution or another, and so on, and submit this information to FINTRAC. This centre then checks the information received against its own to determine if it has any additional information worth disclosing to the agency that made the voluntary disclosure. The procedure is pretty tight, with committees ensuring that this additional information is disclosed only if it is deemed necessary for the purposes of the investigation in question.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267739">It is somewhat like a black box mechanism—really quite ingenious—that prevents the organizations from directly consulting the vast data base and the incredible amount of information it contains but that, at the same time, enables this information to be useful to an investigation.</ParaText><ParaText id="267740">Once FINTRAC has established that the information is pertinent, it is disclosed to the organization in question. However, FINTRAC will not undertake the investigation or legal proceedings. That is not its role.</ParaText><ParaText id="267741">Earlier this morning, we spoke of the committee's work. I was somewhat surprised and rather amused to see Liberals and Conservatives trying to capitalize on or score political points with the work of our committee.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267742">I believe that the committee's work was useful. An amendment proposed by the Liberals was that an organization report to the committee annually. This organization did not seem to be the most appropriate one because it was under the authority of the intelligence service, with which FINTRAC is not really aligned. We supported the amendment in order to continue debate on this matter. It proved to be a good approach because the Conservatives put forward a proposal which, in my opinion, is much more interesting than the original one. It has two components. Initially, the Privacy Commissioner of Canada will be asked to report every two years on the privacy aspect of the bill. I was very pleased with this because I had placed a great deal of emphasis on this issue. We must carefully examine the privacy aspect. </ParaText><ParaText id="267743">Under the law, the Privacy Commissioner already has the authority to investigate if she receives a complaint. I did not believe that was sufficient because having the right to conduct a systematic investigation every two years and having the duty to do so are not the same thing.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267744">Indeed, in order to receive a privacy-related complaint, the individual whose rights were violated must be aware of it. Of course, if someone had illegal access to your private files, chances are you will not know about it. Thus, it becomes difficult to file a complaint. </ParaText><ParaText id="267745">I believe that some work was accomplished by everyone, and the committee was able to achieve a significant result.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp><ParaText id="267746">The committee also discussed a Liberal amendment to allow the Canada revenue agency to directly consult FINTRAC's files, in order to be more effective. I strongly opposed that amendment, because I felt it would create a major breach in privacy protection, as I explained earlier.</ParaText><ParaText id="267747">Why, for efficiency's sake, would we allow an organization to directly consult these files, considering that the Canada revenue agency can, like any other government agency, submit a voluntary disclosure to FINTRAC and eventually receive relevant information, if any, from FINTRAC's database? The committee agreed with me that we should not open that breach, and I was very pleased about that.</ParaText><ParaText id="267748">I think this is a good bill. It has been improved by the committee, and it definitely deserves to be supported by the House. The next logical step for the government would be to work on the issue of tax havens. Tax havens are places where a lot of money laundering is going on. These countries have tax and financial rules that are much more lax than ours. This is why terrorists use them to fund their activities, or simply for money laundering purposes.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267749">By signing agreements with tax havens, we are opening a door and making the work of those people easier. The second reason to work on the tax havens issue is obviously the fiscal inequity. Major companies invest in Barbados, Bermuda or other tax havens of this kind and do not pay taxes in Canada thanks to these little manoeuvres. This makes for a lot of lost revenue for Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="267750">By addressing tax havens, we would be killing two birds with one stone: we would be fighting money laundering and terrorist activity financing, and we would be broadening the tax base, and that would create greater fiscal equity among corporations. I believe that the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> has opened the door on this matter a few times. He has done so in this House. When I spoke to him about it, he said he would review the issue. Yesterday, in committee, following a question from my Bloc Québécois colleague, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78635" Type="2">Joliette</Affiliation>, he also showed interest in this issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="267751">I am very pleased to see this openness. All that I hope for is that this openness will translate into concrete action in the short term. We have to take action in this matter. In my opinion it would be a natural extension of the bill before us today.</ParaText>

I note many of the thoughtful comments made by our justice critic, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78397" Type="2">Windsor—Tecumseh</Affiliation> and our finance critic, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78332" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation>, who analyzed the bill and added some helpful comments that I will try and summarize here.</ParaText><ParaText id="267761">I should note by way of introduction that the bill comes to us as one of a flurry of bills dealing with justice issues. There has been an entire suite of legislation in recent months, some of it good and some not so good. In the NDP's point of view, we believe that some of the bills go too far and some not far enough. I hope I will have time to develop this somewhat. </ParaText><ParaText id="267762">We believe that aspects of Bill <Document DbId="2374081" Type="3">C-25</Document> do not go far enough given the worthwhile goals and objectives stated in the bill. This is one of those situations where the government of the day could have exercised even more authority to solve some of these issues.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267763">Let me start with that one point that I have introduced to explain. Should the bill pass, this would be one of the few places in the Criminal Code where the reverse onus would be contemplated and allowed. This has been controversial in other aspects. For instance, we just finished debating Bill <Document DbId="2172003" Type="3">C-9</Document> yesterday that introduced an element of reverse onus. Should individuals be convicted for a third time of an offence from a list of serious offences, the reverse onus would be put on them to prove why they should not be designated as dangerous offenders and locked up for life.</ParaText><ParaText id="267764">There were howls of derision in the House because the NDP had the temerity to raise the caution that we should only venture into this notion of reverse onus with our eyes open and with due diligence. We think we were justified in that respect and we are taking political heat as a result of it. </ParaText><ParaText id="267765">It was not a pleasant sight yesterday when we were debating Bill <Document DbId="2172003" Type="3">C-9</Document>. I was not proud at all of the tone of the debate that took place just because the NDP had the temerity to question the idea of “three strikes and you're out” and the idea of putting the reverse onus on individuals who are convicted to prove they are not dangerous offenders. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267766">Bill <Document DbId="2374081" Type="3">C-25</Document>, the bill we are addressing today, deals with a reverse onus as well. This is one case where I think the Conservative government has gone soft on crime. I cannot understand why it did not go farther. Even though those members hurled abuse at the NDP for being soft on crime yesterday because we raised a question, in a more respectful way I ask them why they could not have gone tougher on crime in this bill. I will explain what I mean.</ParaText><ParaText id="267767"> In the context of this flurry of crime and justice bills that we are dealing with, we have to establish the notion that crime does not pay. I would hope this would be one way to deter criminals from activities that we are trying to discourage. The prevailing wisdom and the common knowledge out there is that crime does pay. </ParaText><ParaText id="267768">An awful lot of bad people are getting away with an awful lot of things and living a very good life right under the noses of our police officers and law enforcement officers whose hands are tied. They may have darn good reason to believe that somebody is enjoying these luxury goods from ill-gotten gains from the proceeds of crime, but because the burden of proof is so onerous on our police officers and on our criminal justice system, it is rare that the proceeds of crime are actually seized.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp><ParaText id="267769">Bill <Document DbId="2374081" Type="3">C-25</Document> does suggest that in the event of money laundering and fundraising for terrorist activities or belonging to an illegal organization, the government can in fact seize bank accounts and cash assets from individuals and apply the reverse onus. I think that is laudable.</ParaText><ParaText id="267770">I would point out, though, that we could have expanded this notion to include more things than just the bank accounts. In the province of Manitoba we introduced legislation. It was defeated narrowly by the two Liberal members of the Manitoba legislature who would not allow it to pass, but we introduced legislation that was very broad and very sweeping. If a person was a member of a criminal organization and was convicted of a crime, the crown prosecutor could go to a judge who could then assess the material possessions of the criminal.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267771">Let us say the person was a member of an illegal organization like the Hell's Angels and the guy was living in a $750,000 mansion with a tricked out Escalade in the driveway, two boats and a Sea-Doo, and all the tools and jewellery et cetera, the trappings of ill-gotten gains and crime. If that individual could not prove to the judge that the toys were purchased by earnings or by some legally obtained wealth, then we in fact could seize the property. The assets would be liquidated and the proceeds would in fact be dedicated directly to law enforcement, so that we can go out and bust more criminals. I thought that was a great bill and I thought that in the bill before us we could have explored some of those notions.</ParaText><ParaText id="267772">I note that the private member's bill from the Bloc Québécois in the last Parliament proceeded quite a way down the road before Parliament ended and the bill died on the order paper. I think Richard Marceau was the name of the Bloc member who is no longer a member so I can use his name and give him credit. That garnered a lot of support in the House. We thought it was a good idea.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267773">This notion of reverse onus is not foreign to the NDP nor do we oppose it out of hand, but there was derision heaped on us yesterday for raising the idea that we did not believe reverse onus should be used in Bill <Document DbId="2397807" Type="3">C-27</Document>, the “three strikes and you're out” bill. We opposed it yesterday, but that does not mean that we oppose it all the time.</ParaText><ParaText id="267774">Some of the legitimate concerns about Bill <Document DbId="2374081" Type="3">C-25</Document> that were raised above and beyond that observation from my own point of view were that it would put a burden on financial institutions to monitor, track, and take note of suspicious transactions or even overt exchanges of money that may indicate illegal activity. I think this is a necessary aspect of the bill. We have to rely on the cooperation of the financial institutions to alert us when these suspicious transactions take place.</ParaText><ParaText id="267775">However, the burden on smaller financial institutions may be quite onerous. I have an email from the director of the largest credit union on Vancouver Island, Mr. Bob Smits. Mr. Smits noticed that we were raising issues about the bill in the House of Commons and was monitoring it carefully.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267776">He raised a concern that in a smaller financial institution like his, the current regulations, even as they exist today regarding tracking, the FINTRAC legislation, and the financial transactions and report analysis legislation have required his small credit union to hire an enforcement officer. He estimates that the cost of compliance with the current law to be over $100,000 a year.</ParaText><ParaText id="267777">If we compound that burden even further and make the obligation more onerous, we have to accommodate somehow these smaller institutions who want to comply with the law, but who have served notice that they are legitimately concerned that the burden will be passed on to them. They are asking that the government pay attention to the submission made by the credit unions at committee.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp><ParaText id="267778">I am not sure how the submission was received in committee but I did not notice any substantial amendment in that regard. The only amendment I could find in my research for my speech today was a committee stage amendment put forward by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78387" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation>. The amendment stated that SIRC, the Security Intelligence Review Committee, established by section 31, “...shall undertake a review of the operations of the centre in each financial year and shall, within three months after the end of each financial year, submit the annual report to Parliament on those operations”. </ParaText><ParaText id="267779">That is just a mandatory review process, which is not unusual when we are introducing a bill of this nature. I am not sure we took into consideration the legitimate concerns of the Credit Union Central of Canada in its submission to the bill. I want to recognize today that the NDP did take note of CUCC's concerns and we tried to represent its concerns at every stage of the debate on the bill. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267780">One of the points I highlighted in its submission is where CUCC states that “in the absence of compelling evidence of need, Credit Union Central is concerned that the proposed legislation is largely driven by the perceived need to make Canada's AML-ATF regime formally consistent with the new international financial action task force standards, rather than in response to any substantive threat arising from loopholes in Canada's current AML-ATF regime”.</ParaText><ParaText id="267781">I suppose CUCC is questioning whether better enforcement in support of the existing regime may have been adequate to plug the loopholes. These are the practitioners in the field who do not want us to pass legislation unnecessarily unless we can have a demonstrated need proven to them. They also point out, and we should take note of this, that they do not necessarily accept that the need is commensurate with the level of activity contemplated in the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="267782">The one thing that I do take note of and support in the bill is that the bill does include the foreign currency exchange shops. I think this is a logical extension in terms of financial institutions. </ParaText><ParaText id="267783">I would also note that a lot of questionable activity can be shielded in the completely unregulated financial sector of the payday loan companies, many of which, in fact, offer this foreign exchange and foreign delivery of currency.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267784"> As we know, a lot of money leaves Canada every year, expatriated by people who are working in Canada and sending money to other countries. When the completely unregulated payday loan sector started to explode into our communities and started sprouting up like mushrooms on every street corner, we were very concerned. However, one of the things we have not given too much thought to is that one of the services offered by these payday loan outfits is, quite often, wiring money to other countries. </ParaText><ParaText id="267785">The wiring of money was normally done in a fairly regulated setting until these shops started popping up in every strip mall across the country, sometimes three, four and five of them in the same strip mall. I think we will need to pay better attention to the activity involved in that because questionable people have entered into that industry sector. When people can get 1,000% rate of return on their money, a lot of people are taking note and it is no wonder these little shops are sprouting up. </ParaText><ParaText id="267786">In one sting case done by the crown prosecutor for the province of Manitoba, they found that 10,000% interest was being charged by one of these outfits. I believe that is a better rate of return than a person can get selling cocaine. There is no other activity in the country where we can get 10,000% return on an investment, other than these payday loan shops, so it is attracting all the wrong kinds of people. I would suggest that might be one place that officials may want to really look for money laundering, illegal transactions, and bring these payday lenders under tight scrutiny and tight regulation. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp><ParaText id="267787"> I do acknowledge that payday loan legislation is pending in this 39th Parliament, and I welcome that.</ParaText><ParaText id="267788">This bill deals with the legislation governing money laundering as it exists today and tries to strengthen and improve the performance of the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre, or FINTRAC as it is known to the practitioners in the field. </ParaText><ParaText id="267789">FINTRAC, being an independent agency, does report to the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4"> Minister of Finance</Affiliation>. It places obligations on certain individuals and entities to keep records, to identify their clients and to report certain financial transactions.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267790">The second concern brought to our attention by the Credit Union Central of Canada is the obligation to report activity. First, the onerous burden that may be compounded by this legislation to track activity looking for suspect transactions, but also the obligation to turn in the names of member clients, otherwise seemingly innocent transactions may cross some line where a red flag pops up on a file, the institution would have no choice other than to report that individual. It could be someone who has been a member of that credit union for 20 years. We all know that credit unions are a lot more community driven than are some of the bigger banking institutions. It could put the manager of a credit union, who is a member of the community and who might be the coach of the local hockey team, in the difficult situation of having to turn in one of the parents of the children on that hockey team because of a transaction that was possibly innocent but set off a little red flag.</ParaText><ParaText id="267791">There are the privacy elements here that we must take into consideration and there is the awkwardness associated with that.</ParaText><ParaText id="267792">Bill <Document DbId="2374081" Type="3">C-25</Document> seeks to improve and strengthen the performance of the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre.

Second reading</ProceduralText><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Reid" id="1776602"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78620" Type="2">Mr. Scott Reid (Lanark—Frontenac—Lennox and Addington, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="267811">Mr. Speaker, one of the key principles of democracy is that the vote of every citizen should hold exactly the same weight as the vote of every other citizen. This principle which was encapsulated in George Brown's famous slogan, “Representation by population”, was a foundation stone of the Confederation deal of 1867. Today we should do all that we can to prevent this principle from being watered down. </ParaText><ParaText id="267812">Bill <Document DbId="2162132" Type="4">C-290</Document> directly undermines representation by population. The bill would entrench one value for votes cast by Ontarians living north of Lake Nipissing and another value, about 20% lower, for votes cast in the rest of the province. The bill would cause this inequity to expand over time. Bill C-290 would do this by amending the Canada Elections Act so that northern Ontario would never be represented in the House of Commons by fewer than 10 MPs. Before explaining the implications of the bill, I will describe Ontario's electoral status quo. </ParaText><ParaText id="267813">Northern Ontario's current population is 838,000 and it has 10 seats. The rest of the province has a population of 10,572,000 and it has 96 seats. If the principle of representation by population had been followed, the division would have been eight seats for the north and 98 seats for everyone else, but two seats that should have been allocated south of Lake Nipissing were instead placed north of the lake. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267814">It is mathematically impossible to overrepresent one group of voters in a province without partially disenfranchising every other voter in that province. Effectively therefore, the current distribution of Ontario ridings takes away some of the value of each voter's franchise south of Lake Nipissing and gives it to the voters to the north.</ParaText><ParaText id="267815">Specifically, the current seat distribution has the following consequences. One, the average population of the 10 ridings north of the lake is 83,800. Two, the population of the average riding in the rest of the province is 110,000. This is 2.2% higher than it would have been if those two extra seats had not been awarded to the north. Three, as a consequence of this, the vote of every elector living south of Lake Nipissing is worth 24% less than the vote of a northern Ontarian.</ParaText><ParaText id="267816">That is the status quo. By making this arrangement permanent, Bill <Document DbId="2162132" Type="4">C-290</Document> would be almost certain to make the situation even more inequitable. If, as the bill's sponsor seems to assume, the population growth in areas south of the lake continues to outstrip growth in northern Ontario at the current rate, Bill <Document DbId="2162132" Type="4">C-290</Document> would have the practical impact every 10 years of stripping away another 1% from the value of every vote in every riding south of Lake Nipissing, since with each redistribution, the rest of Ontario would be deprived of an additional riding which under the terms of the bill would be reserved for the north.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267817">I suppose one could argue that systematically underweighting votes by 2% or even 3% or 4% as contemplated by the bill is a trivial matter. Perhaps it is trivial for anyone of us in so far as our vote goes, but there are 10.5 million Canadians living south of Lake Nipissing and when so many voters are even partly disenfranchised, it is simply undemocratic and it is wrong.</ParaText><ParaText id="267818">Mr. Speaker, if you are planning on overturning one of the foundation stones of democracy, it behooves you to have powerful reasons. I confess that I do not find the arguments presented thus far in defence of Bill <Document DbId="2162132" Type="4">C-290</Document> to be particularly compelling. As far as I can tell, Bill <Document DbId="2162132" Type="4">C-290</Document> appears to be based on three premises. I will list each of them in turn, pointing out my reservations as I go.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267819">The first premise behind the bill seems to be that the primary function of a member of Parliament is to be a local service provider and solver of constituency problems with the logical consequence that voting in the House of Commons on behalf of constituents is a secondary role. After all, if the primary role of MPs is to provide equitable representation for the people of Canada in this place, it becomes impossible to justify such anomalies as the existence since the last redistribution of one Ontario riding, <Affiliation DbId="78989" Type="2">Kenora</Affiliation>, which in order to compensate for its very large geographical size, has been assigned boundaries that give it a population 40% smaller than the provincial average.</ParaText><ParaText id="267820">In the first hour of debate the member for <Affiliation DbId="78989" Type="2">Kenora</Affiliation> was one of the most eloquent defenders of Bill <Document DbId="2162132" Type="4">C-290</Document>. A glance at <I>Hansard</I> reveals that he and the bill's sponsor spoke at length about the challenges of geography but not a word about the merits of having all votes within Ontario be of equal value.</ParaText><ParaText id="267821">I take very seriously my own role as a service provider in my riding, but it is my view that if it were possible to provide a better level of service to my own constituents at the cost of imposing permanent partial disenfranchisement on the voters of the rest of Ontario, this would not be a justifiable trade-off.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267822">It goes without saying that I do not support the first premise behind Bill <Document DbId="2162132" Type="4">C-290</Document>. Even if I did, the bill would still not be intellectually defensible unless I were also to subscribe to a second premise. </ParaText><ParaText id="267823">This premise holds that in very sparsely populated regions where ridings are necessarily very large, a substantially better level of MP service to constituents can be provided when the population of the riding is reduced by 20% or 30%. After all, if the problems of service provision are not resolved by putting a few extra MPs on the ground in northern Ontario, there is no value in giving extra ridings to the region.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp><ParaText id="267824">I do not agree with this premise any more than I did with the first one, but I will take a moment to review some of the words presented in favour of this premise during the first hour of debate before stating my objections. </ParaText><ParaText id="267825">The member for <Affiliation DbId="78989" Type="2">Kenora</Affiliation> was quite explicit that this was his reason for endorsing the bill. He said that northern Ontario is “a massive chunk of land and deserves to have MPs serving it. It has 10 right now and it needs to remain at that”. The member then went on to point out that Kenora is not only the largest riding in Ontario, it is also the eighth largest in the country. </ParaText><ParaText id="267826">He described some of the practical difficulties involved in servicing the more remote parts of his riding. He pointed out that the communities are far apart and in particular that 21 of them can be reached only by air. I would like to focus on this particular point for a moment because I believe that it reveals what is wrong with the premise that more MPs would lead to better service. I will start by quoting the member verbatim. He said:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267827"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">[Kenora has] 21 fly-in communities.... [T]here are rules in the House of Parliament where we can only travel for four days in our ridings. For me to go to those communities, it takes 21 days straight. I have to go home continually because I have to start the four day cycle again. If we took the population ratio that we try to use now [for the rest of the province], I would probably have 50 or 60 [fly-in communities]. How could anyone possibly service that?</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="267828">The member raised a good point. It may be the case that rules that forbid an MP to travel for more than four days in his riding and charge the expense to the member's office budget should be re-examined. However, the member's assertion that he would have 50 fly-in communities if the population of the riding of <Affiliation DbId="78989" Type="2">Kenora</Affiliation> were increased is simply incorrect. </ParaText><ParaText id="267829">Prior to the last redistribution, the predecessor riding to Kenora was considerably more populous because it included the Rainy River district. But in relative terms, this area was heavily populated so it added only 5% to the area of the riding and had no fly-in communities. This perhaps is why Bob Nault, the MP for the old riding of Kenora--Rainy River, so strenuously opposed the creation of the smaller new riding that now exists. He told a committee of the House of Commons:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267830"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">[The argument is made that Kenora--Rainy River] is too large for the Member of Parliament to service it. I take exception to that, of course. I've been its member for 15 years, and I think we do a pretty good job of managing our way around the riding.... [Red Lake is] basically the end of the road, and from here on up are totally isolated first nation communities. The only way you can get there is by air and/or winter road. So [the southern part] is basically the part I drive to in the summertime--</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="267831">From Mr. Nault's comments we learn that the successful servicing of a large riding requires good management skills. He made reference to the winter roads that let him get to some of the less remote fly-in communities. He indicated that he serviced the non-remote parts of his riding by driving around in the same manner as any other MP.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267832">I know from personal experience that it really is difficult to service a widely spread riding. It takes over two hours to drive from one end of my riding to the other. Here is how we handle things and any MP can do the same thing: One, we rented two offices at two ends of the riding; two, one of my office managers, John Campsall, holds regular mobile constituency offices at community halls in more remote areas; and three, we set up a 1-800 number so that constituents can call us from anywhere without paying long distance fees. </ParaText><ParaText id="267833">I mention all of this to make the point that all of the problems that are represented as being unique to northern Ontario are in fact endemic to all large ridings and in some cases, are worse in genuinely rural ridings with no large centres than in large wilderness ridings with one or two large centres. The largest centre of population in my riding has a population of less than 10,000. By contrast, in Kenora the largest centre has a population of 16,000.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267834">The solution to this problem and to the unique problem of remote communities which is a problem in northern Ontario is not to guarantee a minimum number of MPs to any region, but rather to examine whether the supplemental budget provided by the House of Commons for MPs with large ridings is too small. Currently this amount sits at $35,000 for Kenora and about $250,000 for all of northern Ontario.</ParaText><ParaText id="267835">The upshot of this is I do not think that premise one or premise two hold water, but even if we subscribed to both, that would only provide justification for a bill for making large rural ridings less populous than geographically compact urban ridings. It would not provide justification for the present bill which seeks to make all northern ridings, including that of the bill's sponsor, the riding of <Affiliation DbId="78383" Type="2">Sudbury</Affiliation>, which is one-tenth the size of my riding, less populous.</ParaText><ParaText id="267836">If we want to get involved in making rural ridings larger, frankly I do not think it is justifiable, but that would involve a different bill and the defeat of this bill. As I have said before, I do not believe that it is appropriate to sacrifice one of the cornerstones of democracy on the altar of better constituent services. That can be dealt with by other means, as I have outlined in my remarks.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

This is unacceptable to us.</ParaText><ParaText id="267839">As I said previously, the principle is one person, one vote. I think that the member who introduced this bill, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78383" Type="2">Sudbury</Affiliation>, has a problem in her region, and we understand that. We also have a problem in Quebec. When the commission did its work, we lost two ridings for the 2004 election, one in Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean and the other on the North Shore, because of population migration to larger centres. We no longer had four, but three ridings in Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean.</ParaText><ParaText id="267840">This causes problems, obviously. We went through it, and we are living with the consequences on the parliamentary and human levels, because we lost a member and this is causing a problem in those areas. Obviously, everyone would like to be re-elected, but that is the situation we are faced with.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267841">There is another issue I would like to talk about, because it is important and my colleague did not mention it earlier. We have a mechanism that works and is fairly flexible. It is a system of representation that provides for reviewing the process and readjusting electoral boundaries every 10 years.</ParaText><ParaText id="267842">I have been in Parliament for 13 years, but every 10 years a census takes place and the electoral boundaries are readjusted. A commission is formed for each province, a judge is appointed and commissioners tour all the ridings to hear what the people and the members think should happen.</ParaText><ParaText id="267843">There are criteria to be met with regard to population density and the area of the riding. In my own case, I had a riding known as Laurentides, which I think was one of the largest ridings in Canada. It included about 80 municipalities, and I represented it for 10 years. Major changes had to be made because of population growth in the southern part of my riding. It was therefore divided up.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267844">In some regions, ridings were removed, while in others, like mine—the Laurentians, Laval and Lanaudière—population growth has led to the creation of new ridings, such as Rivière-du-Nord. Rivière-du-Nord, which covers one RCM, covers a lot less territory than Laurentides, but a new riding was created, so there is now a new member for that riding.</ParaText><ParaText id="267845">When the commissioner visited our region, I had the opportunity to make representations. In fact, anyone who wanted to submit a brief could do so. We had 30 days to meet with the commissioners and provide feedback. I felt it made sense to redraw the boundaries. The riding had so many people that it was difficult to represent given the population density. So we broke it into two ridings, which made it much easier to get the work done. And we got a new member of Parliament for the region.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267846">Obviously, other regions have problems too. Some populations are growing and others are shrinking, which means that in some areas, there are geographically huge ridings. One of our colleagues from the North Shore is dealing with just such a situation. Nevertheless, the criteria for making representations to the commission are fairly flexible. The commission has offices in every province. I would therefore invite my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78383" Type="2">Sudbury</Affiliation> to make representations.</ParaText><ParaText id="267847">This also enables us to make representations about how to name our ridings. It is important for names to represent the ridings, so we had the right to change the riding names if necessary.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp><ParaText id="267848">I personally did so. Rivière-du-Nord is the full name of the RCM. The name was quite appropriate especially since Rivière du Nord flows through my entire riding.</ParaText><ParaText id="267849">Representations may be made to the commission. There is that flexibility. In some regions, important representations have led to significant changes. These representations were made by MPs or by means of submissions.</ParaText><ParaText id="267850">The redistributions do not always follow the lay of the land. They are made by public servants. I am not saying that they are not doing a good job, but they have to take into account all the ridings. In our ridings, there are a certain ways of looking at things and we know very well that it will not work to put such and such a municipality with another one and that it makes no sense to make certain changes.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267851">So we can make our representations, and then the commission makes a decision. We have an important role to play when commissioners visit our regions, and I think they listen to us. At least, they did in our case. Even among colleagues, we had problems. Some of our colleagues wanted to keep some municipalities in their ridings, but in the end, we reached an agreement.</ParaText><ParaText id="267852">I think the member for <Affiliation DbId="78383" Type="2">Sudbury</Affiliation> is having the same problems we had in Quebec, because we, too, lost ridings. She will have an opportunity to make representations in a few years the next time the commission convenes. I am sure she, too, will see major changes in her riding. There is bound to be growth and decline. In my riding, the population grew so fast that decisions had to be made. </ParaText><ParaText id="267853">I would therefore invite my colleague to make representations to the commission, which will convene during the next census, rather than try to change electoral boundaries here with this bill. </ParaText><ParaText id="267854">I should add that this would be unfair to the other provinces and Quebec because we would be solving problems in Ontario, but not in other provinces, such as Quebec and, I imagine, British Columbia and Alberta.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267855">The process has to be fair for everyone, and I am not seeing that in this bill. My colleague had a good idea, but she knows perfectly well that our system is already pretty flexible, and that we have the right to make important representations to bring about necessary changes during electoral boundary redistributions.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Arbitrary lines were drawn on the map which divided up rural regions that had long been a homogenous whole and a patchwork of ridings were created instead. This was done with no input from the people in the north. I am very aware of the sense of disenfranchisement that exists among people in the north.</ParaText><ParaText id="267858">What disturbs me when we discuss this issue is to hear members of other parties stand up and say all votes should be equal and everything should be fair. The reality is that all votes are not equal and have never been equal. In ridings in northern Ontario the average population is about 85,000 to 90,000 people. The average population of a riding in Saskatchewan is 69,000 people. We need to apply the same standard to northern Ontario as that applied to Saskatchewan. Let us apply that to Yukon where there are 35,000 people per seat. Why is it that Prince Edward Island has four seats? Is that 25,000 people per seat? These were guaranteed seats and I do not object to that. My colleague from the Bloc is of course opposing this bill as I expected she would. I am surprised in some ways because Quebec has also been guaranteed a certain number of seats.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267859">The problem in Ontario is the major dislocation between the needs of the rural north and the needs of the urban north. One of the fundamental principles of democracy is the availability of a member of Parliament to his or her constituents. I lived in Toronto for awhile. I could walk 15 minutes one way to an MP's office and 15 minutes the other way to another MP's office. The riding of <Affiliation DbId="78395" Type="2">Timmins--James Bay</Affiliation> is larger than the United Kingdom. I have gone into parts of my riding that no other member of Parliament has gone into before. </ParaText><ParaText id="267860">Talking about disenfranchisement, we just need to look at the James Bay coast where upward of 30% of the population does not have birth certificates. They do not have SIN numbers. They are not even on the map. They live in terrible conditions. I am talking about places like Kashechewan, Attawapiskat and Fort Albany. Health Canada has never provided proper health services to these communities. It just has a MASH unit available. </ParaText><ParaText id="267861">If a child gets sick and has to be flown out and that child does not have a birth certificate, the cost is charged to the regional health authority. The regional health authority in James Bay is swimming in debt because the federal government will not accept the fact that so many people who live on that land even exist. A major deficit has occurred in terms of health and education dollars. </ParaText>

Their officials never go there. Our office is there all the time. We are the ones filling out the birth certificates and the other forms. A member said we should get a little more organized and do what is done in southern Ontario. We run five offices out of our region and our staff are on the road all the time. </ParaText><ParaText id="267863"> This is not just about constituency service. This is about political service as well. I sit in the House and listen to members talking about how unfair it is that Saskatchewan does not get to keep 100% of its non-renewable resources. I hear about the need for Newfoundland to maintain rights to its non-renewable resources. Northern Ontario is entirely dependent on non-renewable resources and none of that money has ever gone back to the region. </ParaText><ParaText id="267864">Kirkland Lake is a struggling gold mine community. In the 1930s right up until the 1960s, Kirkland Lake was keeping the economy of Ontario alive. None of that money went back to the community. Across the border in Rouyn-Noranda and Val-d'Or there are communities that created one-quarter of the wealth that northern Ontario created and they have proper cities with proper infrastructure. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267865">There have been years of neglect in the resource-based communities of northern Ontario. We need to ensure that a fair system is in place similar to southern Ontario. We need to ensure that when these other communities expand and prosper that their prosperity is not at the expense of communities in northern Ontario that are stretched out over a vast area. These communities face major infrastructure problems, major economic problems, and have massive youth out-migration.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp><ParaText id="267866">We need to maintain a strong political voice for those people. It is only fair. That is what we have in other parts of Canada. We are not asking to go down to 68,000 or 69,000 population size type seats that we see in Nova Scotia. No, we will live with our 85,000 plus that we have in northern Ontario. </ParaText><ParaText id="267867">The city of Sudbury, which has a bigger population base than Prince Edward Island, has the same amount of political representation as P.E.I. We recognize that we will do without, but I find it absolutely astounding that members from southern Ontario stand in the House and say that by allowing the people of northern Ontario to have the same fair voice as rural regions and the rest of the country, it is somehow disenfranchising 905 and is somehow ripping off people in Markham by preventing them from having their elected representative in the House. It just does not make sense.</ParaText><ParaText id="267868">It does not make sense when there is a need to have voices articulating the issues of rural based people, people living in forest and mining economies who understand the issues of northern Ontario. We have a right to be heard in the House the same way that people in Yukon, Prince Edward Island and Quebec have a right to representation, and the same way the rural regions and the rest of the country are given that clear exemption.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267869">We are not asking to go down to their levels of 69,000, 35,000 or 25,000 persons per constituency.

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Szabo" id="1776625"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78477" Type="2">Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="267870">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill <Document DbId="2162132" Type="4">C-290</Document>. I had an opportunity to review the argument given during the first hour of debate. I have listened today to the representations of the other three parties. I am not sure whether there is a consensus in the House as to what the intent of the bill is, what the basic principle is.</ParaText><ParaText id="267871">I think the bill calls out and says that as our population redistributes province by province, every region in the country, and that the per cent of population in our remote regions continues to remain flat or go down, whereas we have a higher concentration in urban centres. This means that not only the geographic size of a particular constituency or riding continues to grow, but there are consequences to the quality of representation that the people who live within the constituency can get as it continues to grow.</ParaText><ParaText id="267872">There are ridings in Canada that take five hours to fly across. There are constituencies that have 25 or 30 different communities of distinct interest. There are constituencies that have never seen a member of Parliament.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267873">Canada is a very diverse country. In fact, some people out there do not think they are even Canadians any more. No one is talking about their issues. Rural and remote regions of Canada, ostensibly represent the resource industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="267874">When we think of rural versus urban issues, they are becoming more and more of concern to Canadians. Rural and resource areas, the remote regions of Canada, are getting less attention on the agenda of Parliament, less attention in the laws of Canada and less attention in the investment in their infrastructure and in the services. I think in northern Ontario there is only one passport office. Someone may have to travel a hundred kilometres to the nearest spot to get a passport.</ParaText><ParaText id="267875">When we think about the growing size of the geography of a riding, where there is a dispersion of population, all Canadians equal to representation and access are not getting it. In fact, the accessibility to services is not there, whether it be health care, social services, education or other needs that all Canadians wish to share with each other. They are not equally accessible.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267876">When those services are not readily available through infrastructure that the Government of Canada has put in all of these communities, people use the member of Parliament as the only person who can help them with their issues, which normally would go through a Government of Canada office. It means the member of Parliament in a rural or remote area of Canada is doing the job that urban members of Parliament, such as myself, take for granted and are done by these other agencies that are available. </ParaText><ParaText id="267877">Communities in our country are still on party lines. They do not have dedicated phone lines. They do not have access to Internet. They do not have cell networks. Most of our work in urban Canada utilizes those new technologies. Those are not available. Are those people who live in these areas, and not only northern Ontario, but any rural or remote area of Canada, not entitled to the same accessibility for services to which Canadians in urban centres are entitled? How do we get the equity here?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267878">I understand the representations that have been made about representation by population. Because of the constitutional guarantees for provinces, and I will not mention a province because I do not want to pit province against province. nine out of ten provinces are guaranteed a minimum number of seats. Only Ontario does not have a minimum number of seats for representation in Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="267879">In fact, the province of Ontario in 2005 passed legislation to guarantee, I believe, 11 seats for northern Ontario. It has legislation in place because it recognizes the importance of having a voice at the table, not necessarily proportionate to the number of people in that region, representing the interests of that region. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp><ParaText id="267880">Representation by population is an important aspect. It is not, however, the current situation in Canada. It is not, in fact, reflective of the current democracy in Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="267881"> I appeal to the government and I appeal to the Bloc Québécois as well to let us look at this bill, not solely from the perspective of northern Ontario but from the perspective of representative democracy, both at election time and in terms of the accessibility of the services that all Canadians should enjoy.</ParaText><ParaText id="267882">I think we should consider that the principle of this bill is not that it is a northern Ontario bill. It is a Canada bill. It is a Canada bill on behalf of every rural and remote area of Canada, to make sure that as we move down the line, as we get this distribution of population into urban and suburban centres and the percentage of population in rural and remote areas continues to go down, the issues and the contributions that population makes are not diminished in some way simply because there are not that many people.</ParaText><ParaText id="267883">As a matter of fact, as the technology changes, the numbers of people in agriculture and in natural resource development and delivery are going to go down because we are going to be able to do it more efficiently and meet our needs with less people. Towns are going to disappear.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="267884">I do not know how long that is going to take, but we need to keep Canadians connected. The only way to keep Canadians connected is basically through the services that are provided. If, because of population, those services are not being provided by the Government of Canada through offices within reasonable areas, that representation can only be provided by a member of Parliament. That is why we need to have some careful consideration of whether or not the representation of people of Canada in rural and remote areas is equitable. Their voices have to be heard.</ParaText><ParaText id="267885"> I believe that this bill gives us an opportunity to discuss it. I do not think it matters whether the bill passes in terms of becoming legislation in Canada. What does matter, however, is that the points that have been made are important points that should be taken to committee, so that the committee can determine whether or not we are facing a problem or whether there are some remedial steps that can be taken to make absolutely sure that the true representation of all Canadians is respected.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Diane Marleau (Sudbury, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="267886">Mr. Speaker, I must say that I have listened carefully. The argument of representation by population is one that I have heard many times, but the reality is that we do not have absolute representation by population now. The quotient is determined by the number of ridings and the population in the province. Ontario's quotient is 107,000 and something. The average quotient for all other provinces is about 60,000. What I am saying is that there is no absolute representation by population.</ParaText><ParaText id="267887">At what point do we allow the regions of the country to deteriorate in such a manner so that they have no voice?

If there is no need for 10 ridings in the north, let us talk about it. Following the last redistribution, a committee recommended that a study be conducted. So, let us conduct a study before cutting ridings in northern Ontario, or let us at least talk about it. It does not take anything away from anyone.</ParaText><ParaText id="267890">I am asking for the hon. members' support so that the bill can be referred to committee.
