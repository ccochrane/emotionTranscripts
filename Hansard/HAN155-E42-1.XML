              <ParaText id="4809883"> According to <I>Maclean's</I>, Quebec is a pathologically alienated and deficient society compared to the rest of Canada. Basically, it lacks social solidarity. We are becoming accustomed to being scorned by Canada, and increasingly outraged. Quebec-bashing has become socially acceptable in Canada. No other community could ever be humiliated this way without the House of Commons reacting with shock and outrage. If the author had written that Catholics, the Greek community, or homosexuals, for example, are pathologically alienated, the House would have rightly reacted vigorously and unanimously in the face of such an abuse. However, when Quebec is the victim, it does not matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4809884">Yesterday the member for <Affiliation DbId="214282" Type="2">La Pointe-de-l'Île</Affiliation> moved a motion to condemn <I>Maclean's</I>, but the House rejected it. That move speaks volumes about the respect that federal parliamentarians have for Quebec.</ParaText>

I would humbly submit to the House that we have had to witness this exchange even though we cannot sit on the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs or any other committee.

However, what made that flood more damaging to the community was the actions of the RCMP after the flood, where it allegedly illegally entered more than 4,600 homes in the community. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810167">The petitioners ask the government to look into and determine if any of these were unwarranted entries that violated the privacy rights and property rights of High River residents; determine if these entries were contrary to any provisions of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms; and debate and vote on a motion calling on the government to rebuild trust within the RCMP among High River residents by holding an independent judicial inquiry into the legal justification from the RCMP entering 4,600 homes in High River. </ParaText>

That is less than the price of a chocolate bar. From this, it is making huge profits from our water.</ParaText>

There are historical and procedural reasons why all members of Parliament are given equal access to this sensitive information, but there is also a very important economic reason, and that is, any individual having advance access to this sensitive information could potentially profit from it. We do recall that roughly a decade ago, an RCMP investigation was launched into a previous budget measure because certain individuals were given an advance view of a decision with respect to income trusts. That RCMP investigation led to charges.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810218">We have no evidence at this point that anything of that nature has occurred here. However, Mr. Speaker, I would ask you to broaden the investigation that the hon. member has asked you to carry out to ensure that none of the sensitive information contained in the budget was shared by members of the government who had advance access to it, prior to its public and parliamentary release. </ParaText>

That optimism and that confidence helped define us as a country. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810251">Sharing those beliefs with others made Canada a beacon of diversity, openness, and generosity around the world, yet over the last few decades, the middle class and those working hard to join it have fallen behind. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4810260">In Mian's case, with three children aged 11, 9, and 10 months, the Canada child benefit means that he and his wife receive about $300 more each month than they did a year ago. That is an extra $3,600 tax-free every year, money that can be put toward groceries, school supplies, and new clothes for going back to school.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4810297">We know, for example, that while Canadian companies are getting better when it comes to hiring more women, they are still less effective at promoting women to senior roles, and we know that fewer women join or stay in the workforce than men.

              <ParaText id="4810326">Without a shadow of a doubt, we have come to understand one thing today: the Liberal government has completely lost control of public finances. I would remind members that barely two years ago, those people were elected by promising a small $10 billion deficit and a balanced budget in 2019. In 2019, Canadians will have a deficit of $27.9 billion. That is completely unacceptable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810327">This government has no regard for Canadians because it has completely lost control of government spending. Over the next six years, this government is going to run up a deficit of $113 billion. Barely six months ago, it gave us an economic update and today we see that it was off by $13 billion. Those people do not know how to count.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810328">Even worse, as of midnight, Canadians are going to pay new taxes on tobacco, on alcohol, and, soon, on Uber. This government is making up taxes. On top of that, even though this government constantly lectures everyone about the environment, it is going to abolish the tax credit for people who use public transit. </ParaText>

They have been told that they are going to have to wait a little longer. Basically, they will have to wait until the next federal election, which is when the floodgates will open and investment dollars will flow into our communities.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4810336">The Liberal Party has often told the House that it would close the gap between indigenous children and non-indigenous children, which is what the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal called for. However, there is nothing in this budget about keeping that promise. Instead, the government has kept a tax loophole open so that CEOs and the wealthiest members of society can get tax breaks for stock options. The government is giving the richest 1% a tax break that is worth six times more, but it is turning its back on indigenous children and the Canadian federation. </ParaText>
