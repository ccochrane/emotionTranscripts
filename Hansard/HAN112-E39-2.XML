Third reading</ProceduralText><ParaText id="1160027"> 
The House resumed from June 12 consideration of the motion that Bill <Document DbId="3120196" Type="3">C-29, An Act to amend the Canada Elections Act (accountability with respect to loans)</Document>, be read the third time and passed.
</ParaText><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Lee" id="2532757"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough—Rouge River, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1160028">Mr. Speaker, we are continuing debate on Bill <Document DbId="3120196" Type="3">C-29</Document>, which is a bill that the government has put forward to regulate loans made in political campaigns: elections, leadership contests and nominations.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160029">It is an area that is probably not well understood by most people who do not participate in the political process. It is perhaps sometimes a little more complicated now than I think it needs to be, but nonetheless it is an area that does need some regulation. Federal laws have attempted to do that over the last few years.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160030"> I want to start by saying that a loan is actually integral to many campaigns. It is facilitatory to a campaign. It enables many campaigns to get up and running when there may not be sufficient funds at the beginning of the campaign.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160031">The dynamic of a campaign varies in regard to candidate, place and circumstance, but in most campaigns there are a lot of expenses. I am talking first about campaigns for elections to the House of Commons. There are a lot of expenses at the front end of a campaign. I guess that is so in the business world too. </ParaText><ParaText id="1160032">At the front end of a campaign, there are expenses. Perhaps one has to secure premises for a campaign office or pay cash for election signs and brochures. Deposits are required on telephones or other equipment such as computers and also on leases. At the front end of the campaign, there actually is a fair bit of uploading of the expenses.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160033">Of course, the fundraising for a campaign can happen before the campaign, during the campaign and after the campaign, but the cash need is right at the beginning. Thus, there is the need for such a loan for most campaigns.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160034">A lot of campaigns will have already fundraised and will have enough money to get going. Some members around here are fortunate enough to have raised enough money before the campaign even starts, keeping in mind that when we seek election to the House of Commons, there are election spending limits.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160035"> We all know pretty much what the spending limit is. For most of us, it is in the range of $70,000 or $80,000 per campaign. If a candidate has raised that at the beginning, he or she is ready to go, but what about those who have not?</ParaText><ParaText id="1160036"> For example, a member of Parliament is supposed to know roughly when an election is coming, and he or she can raise money. On the other hand, a candidate who is not an incumbent will often come in as a nominated candidate for a party that is not holding the riding. Often that person has not had a run-up of one, two, three or four years in raising money. </ParaText><ParaText id="1160037">There is a conspicuous need in that case. A person who wants to run for Parliament for a party that has not held a riding may have a significant cash need at the beginning of a campaign. The only way to bridge that cash need is to borrow the money.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160038">Over the past century, that money has come from friends or the father-in-law, or banks or other financial institutions, and we have managed to make do. However, recently there have been suggestions that there have been occasions when these loans have been given or granted and then, at some point after the event, they have been forgiven, so that the candidate who borrowed the money never actually had to pay the money back.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1160039">In our electoral system, that might be seen as unfair. I have a very extreme example, one that will probably never happen. Let us say that an individual says he or she is going to run for party A. Party A tells that individual not to worry, that the party will lend him or her the money to get going, and that Mr. X will lend the individual $50,000. They go through the campaign. When it is over, let us say that the candidate is unsuccessful and Mr. X says that is okay, it was his obligation to the party and he is forgiving the loan. </ParaText><ParaText id="1160040">Let us contrast that situation with another individual who has raised $100 here and there and has worked hard and operated within the rules. It may be seen as quite unfair that a candidate or party has a rich friend who basically underwrites the whole thing and seems to circumvent what we now have, which is election contribution limits. For an individual, the limit is about $1,100 per person. A $50,000 loan lent and forgiven obviously circumvents the intent of the election contribution limits that we already have in law.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160041">For some reason, though, notwithstanding that we have made some corrections in the past, the government party here still thinks that these loans are a big problem. It has come back with this legislation that knocks them down and almost squeezes them out of existence.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160042">I have to say that most businesses need these types of loans. They are a part of how our economy operates. A campaign is no different. Many people have mortgages on their homes, car loans and lines of credit. Why would a campaign for the House of Commons or for a leadership not have the same kinds of financial needs? I think they do. </ParaText><ParaText id="1160043">Under our Constitution, people who run for office ought not to be prejudiced or handicapped any more than an ordinary citizen out there doing other things, with reasonable constraints. I agree that any legislation which prevents forgiveness of a huge loan that would circumvent the election contribution limits should be established. That would be justifiable, in my view.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160044">In this legislation, for some reason, the government, and I believe it is supported by one or two of the other opposition parties, sees a need to micromanage the loan situation, in my view overly, to the point where I think it may have crossed the line. I will explain this in my remarks a little later. Having started with the premise that we have to in some ways restrict the loan arrangements, I am suggesting that the provisions in this bill go way too far.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160045">The amendments in this bill restrict the amount of a loan that an individual can make. I am not sure why that has to be. I can see why there is an election contribution limit, but if a loan has to be made and there has to be transparency and disclosure of it and it has to be repaid, I do not understand why it is necessary to restrict the amount that an individual can actually lend. It enforces a repayment regime. I question whether it is necessary to impose an actual time limited regime. In this case, the bill does that.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160046">It does something else that in my view is quite insidious and unfair. The legislation says that if a loan is not repaid in a particular campaign, then the political party under which that person ran must assume that debt.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1160047">For the average citizen that may sound almost all right and what is the big deal, but if we go down to the riding level, where we have three, four or five parties running, not each of these parties running candidates at the local level are smooth-oiled machines. These are regular Canadians, some of them for the first time embarking on a run for office. </ParaText><ParaText id="1160048">It is possible that a particular candidate may on his or her own volition, wittingly or unwittingly, borrow a ton of money. The main party may not know about it and the central campaign may not know about it. However, at the end of the time period, and it would be a sad comment on the individual, the individual could say, “To heck with it. I'm walking. I'm declaring bankruptcy”, and the main party would be stuck with that debt. That would create a huge liability contingency for all the political parties. </ParaText><ParaText id="1160049">The large political parties, the Liberal Party of Canada, the Conservative Party of Canada, and I think the other parties represented in the House have fairly decent financial means. However, there are other political parties out on the street. Our Elections Act provides for that. </ParaText><ParaText id="1160050">Those parties are being forced, under this legislation, to play by those same rules. I have a sense that it is unfair to impose that kind of a rule on a new or young political party. It could seriously damage it financially in a circumstance where the main party itself does not have control over what its candidates are spending and borrowing. There is no provision in our law that would allow that to happen. I could not conceive of one. </ParaText><ParaText id="1160051">Therefore, this is a serious problem and I absolutely do not support that. I am going to do everything I can inside the House and outside, and later, to make sure this provision is not applied.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160052">The next area I want to touch on has to do with the relationship between what this bill tries to do and our constitutional freedom. I am of the view that some of these provisions do not pass constitutional muster. I think they are vulnerable under our Constitution. </ParaText><ParaText id="1160053">It is not clear to me that anyone has measured and assessed the constitutional implications of some of the measures in this bill. Certain parts of this legislation impose these loan restrictions. One in particular states that a candidate for nomination, or a candidate for office, or a candidate for leadership can only borrow from a financial institution. I think we have a problem. </ParaText><ParaText id="1160054">As I said earlier, it is not clear to me why we have to restrict loans, coming only from financial institutions. It seems kind of reasonable, like we would just want to buy beer from a beer store or buy liquor from a liquor store. However, in terms of loans, this is a much different thing.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160055">I have to say there is the perspective of the borrower, that is the candidate, which is pretty much the perspective that the government has imposed on this bill and which the other two opposition parties appear to be supporting. However, there is another perspective and that is the perspective of the lender. Of course, the lenders include everybody else in this country. We sometimes around this place focus a little too much on who we are as MPs and I am as guilty of that sometimes as others. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1160056">However, when we are talking about lending money to campaigns, it is everybody else in the country. It is all of the businesses, all of the financial institutions, all of the fathers-in-law that might lend money, or wherever we might borrow money. It is all of our citizens.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160057">They have the right to all of our freedoms and the right to be unrestricted in what they do. I ask, why should an individual be restricted in lending money to a political campaign when a financial institution is not? What the heck are we doing? We curtail what a citizen can do, when we do not curtail what a financial institution can do. That is wrong. That is turning the whole thing on its head. In the government's rush to nail this area down with rules so restrictive, we will have to hire another army of accountants to police it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160058">The Conservatives have actually managed to abridge the rights and freedoms of Canadian citizens, and the only ones they wanted to leave out are the financial institutions. God love the financial institutions. We love them. We are indebted to them. We are in hock to them.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160059">However, I have to say that the government and Parliament cannot abridge the freedoms of our citizens unless they do it properly under our Constitution. They can only abridge those freedoms, unless they do it, if they do it, for reasons that are demonstrably justifiable in a free and democratic society.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160060">Who, on the government side, has articulated the demonstrably justifiable reasons for abridging the freedom of Canadians to participate in political campaigns, for example, by lending money, which has to be repaid, to a candidate? </ParaText><ParaText id="1160061">There are many other types of lending institutions in society. They can lend money to buy cars. They can lend money to buy houses. They can lend money to take a bus trip, but they cannot lend money to one of the most vital institutions of our democracy, which is an election campaign.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160062">I do not think I have heard this come up earlier, but it is a real issue for me and it has to be dealt with. The bill is at third reading. It is very tough to fix a bill at third reading, in fact we cannot.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160063">I am inviting the other place, when it sees the bill, to review it with this perspective in mind. If the government cannot come up with reasons to abridge the rights and freedoms of Canadians out there in the way I just described it, that are demonstrably justifiable, then this provision that prohibits individuals from lending to political campaigns is not constitutionally enforceable, and it will go down. I will help to bring it down if I can. I am sure I will be able to help somewhere. </ParaText><ParaText id="1160064">I ask the other place, when and if it has a chance to look at this bill, which I am sure it will if we pass it at third reading, to look at it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160065">There is a second side of the coin in insisting that only financial institutions can lend the money and it is this. We are forcing financial institutions to become partners on the street with political campaigns, and this our banks have never wanted to do. It is very difficult for them to do it. I do not know how we can force a bank manager in a particular riding to start picking and choosing between the Liberal Party, the Conservative Party, the New Democratic Party, the Bloc Québécois, and all of the other political parties. If they lend to one, do they have to lend to the others?</ParaText><ParaText id="1160066">There is more than one bank, but this forces the banks, in a sense, to either politicize themselves or to be seen to be politicizing themselves, and this is not right either. This is a problem and I do not think that has been adequately articulated.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160067">The bill should have had some fixes. The committee tried to fix the bill and I thought the bill had been fixed, but when we got it back to the House, the government party, in league with other parties, decided it would remove those amendments.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1160068">I am very concerned about the constitutionality of this and its impact on the street. I think we are making a mistake and for that reason I am not going to support the bill.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Lukiwski" id="2532799"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78960" Type="18">Mr. Tom Lukiwski (Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons and Minister for Democratic Reform, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1160069">Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask a question, based on not today's presentation but on a comment that the hon. member made yesterday. I had spoken yesterday in questions and comments at great length about the fact that several of the Liberal leadership candidates, from their previous leadership campaign, had missed a deadline, the 18 month repayment deadline, and were seeking extensions or some other form of repayment options with Elections Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160070">The member, in response to my comments, stood in this place and went on at great length, I would suggest, to suggest my comments were in error, that there was really no 18 month repayment required. I would point out to the member that according to Elections Canada, it states so quite clearly. It says that contestants are required, not may or perhaps, to pay any outstanding debts within 18 months of the end of the contest. Of course, the end of that contest, the 18 month period, in the case of the Liberal leadership campaign, came in early June of this year.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160071">There are some other recourses if they fail to repay at the end of the 18 month period, but the fact is there is an 18 month repayment requirement. I wonder if my hon. colleague would care to retract his comments from yesterday.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Lee" id="2532802"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Mr. Derek Lee</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1160072">Mr. Speaker, it is my view that the hon. member is still misleading the House and the public. He has used the term “debt”. The word used in the statute is a “claim”. It is claims that must be repaid within 18 months and there is an explicit exception for loans, where the loan has been turned into a written agreement.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160073">I am sick and tired of hearing the government twist reality into its propaganda, the twisting of reality. If it were an 18 month deadline, may I ask anyone around here to tell me the implication of that. There was no implication when the 18 months came and went. The reason is that loans to campaigns are not claims until the person who makes the loan makes it a claim and the legislation explicitly states that if there is a loan, and it is in a written agreement for repayment, then it is accepted from the definition of the claim.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160074">I cannot say that too many times, but let that please be the end of this misleading hokey foisted upon this House and the public by the government.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160075"><B>An hon. member:</B> You should be in Hollywood.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="30">(1030)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Lee" id="2532865"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Mr. Derek Lee</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1160076">Well, I am prepared to go anywhere and say this, and I am prepared to actually have a chat with Elections Canada and the lawyers at Elections Canada. Let us get this nailed down because everyone knows here that if there is a written agreement to repay a loan, it runs out beyond the 18 months, and that is exactly what has happened.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160077">Of the $12 million borrowed for the Liberal leadership campaigns, approximately $10 million has been repaid and there is still $1.5 million or $2 million to go and that will run over for the next year or so. But, relax.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Martin (Winnipeg Centre)" id="2532805"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78531" Type="2">Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1160078">Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation> that the whole principle behind the bill is to take big money out of politics so there is no unfair competitive advantage to any person running for politics because of who he or she knows. </ParaText><ParaText id="1160079"> I want to challenge my colleague on this idea and ask him to elaborate on it. Where does he get the idea that it would be better to have the loan loophole come from individuals rather than from financial institutions? The whole premise of that clause in the bill is to avoid the “good ol' boy” connections as well as the connections with business and unions, where they are not allowed to donate a single penny to an election campaign. </ParaText><ParaText id="1160080">Under the current loophole, my union, the carpenters union, could loan me $100,000 and not push me to pay it back. That would be fundamentally wrong. It would give me an inside competitive advantage over other people running in the same election campaign who may not have connections with a union, or a business, or a rich uncle or an individual lending it to themselves. For example, it is fundamentally wrong for a guy who owns a car dealership to have his dealership loan him $250,000. However, it is perfectly legitimate for that same individual to get a $30,000 or $50,000 start-up loan from a bank or a credit union. In fact, it is necessary if we are to give equal access to the electoral system to all people who want to seek office.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160081">My colleague has a convoluted, pretzel logic. He is a complicated man and an intellectual, but this reasoning is so convoluted that it does not hold water.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Lee" id="2532807"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Mr. Derek Lee</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1160082">Mr. Speaker, the hon. member says that the objective is to squeeze big money out of political campaigns, but this legislation would not squeeze big money out. It allows banks to lend the big money. If he thinks the “good ol' boy” network does not include bank managers, then he is deluding himself there as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160083">In terms of logic, if it is okay for a bank to lend $20,000 to get a campaign up and running then, why is it not okay for a citizen to lend $20,000 to get a campaign up and running, on the assumption that the money has to be paid back and that it is disclosed as part of the campaign? This is how we do it now.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160084">I do not understand why the hon. member is so happy foisting upon the banks the sole responsibility for providing the interim cash flow, the line of credit, or the loan, for a political campaign. All citizens should have that right, provided there is disclosure and the amount is repaid.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Lukiwski" id="2532818"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78960" Type="18">Mr. Tom Lukiwski (Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons and Minister for Democratic Reform, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1160085">Mr. Speaker, much to the chagrin, I am sure, of my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation>, I will return to the fact, and I emphasize the word “fact”, that any unpaid debts at the end of 18 months of a leadership campaign must be repaid. That is quite clear in the elections act.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160086">My hon. colleague has said that he is sick and tired of hearing this and that these words are being twisted because they are not debts but claims. I point out for the hon. member that the act currently includes loans as claims. Therefore, any unpaid loan is an unpaid claim. </ParaText><ParaText id="1160087">I will give the member this opportunity to retract his earlier comments.

Bob Rae (Toronto Centre, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1160094">Mr. Speaker, I participate in this debate with some considerable interest.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160095"> I do not want to bore members, but I have been elected nine times, federally and provincially, under either federal or provincial statutes. I have run for two leadership contests in two different political parties in two different political jurisdictions, once successfully and once unsuccessfully, but both thoroughly enjoyable experiences.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160096">I have had quite a considerable amount of experience, since first being elected to this place in 1978 and in the province of Ontario in 1982, in looking at the question of election financing. Therefore, I would like to put the debate on this set of amendments in a context.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160097">For a long time, in most provinces, there were very few limits on contributions and very little transparency in the system with respect to who could spend what, whatever limits there might be, and what had to be declared of did not have to be declared. Companies, unions and individuals were allowed to give. Looking around the world, this is what pertains in a great many jurisdictions. </ParaText><ParaText id="1160098">I think there is a very widespread feeling, and certainly one that I share, that this is not a very desirable circumstance in which our democracy should operate and that our democracy should operate under the rule of law, under a rule of transparency and of accountability and under the principle that one does not have to be rich to run for political office and that political office should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their circumstances.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160099">Speaking very personally, the first time I ran for Parliament in 1978, I ran for a nomination in which I would have spent somewhere in the order of $500. The money was raised from a group of friends of mine from law school, who all contributed money so I could run for the nomination. The spending limit at the time I was elected would have been something in the order of $25,000 to $30,000. Contributions came in large and small amounts. It was, by any stretch of the imagination, in discussing with my American or British friends how that system compared with others, a very democratic and open system.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160100">In the early 1970s in the province of Ontario, the premier of the day, Mr. Davis, asked Dalton Camp to chair an inquiry into election financing in the province because there had been a great deal of concern about the principles, which I have outlined: the principle of transparency, the principle of accountability and the principle that the system should be seen to be fair and should be seen to be operating in a fair manner.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160101">Mr. Camp was a Progressive Conservative of some note and he wrote what I think many people would regard as a very fine report. He was assisted in that regard by Mr. Doug Fisher, who is well known to many of us as a public figure and commentator, a former member in this place, and by the former leader of the Liberal Party in Ontario, Mr. Farquhar Oliver as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160102">They produced a report that set out some of these principles, but it also did something else, which is worth noting. The way Mr. Davis approached it was to go to the other political parties and say, “We have a problem”, not “I have a problem”, or not “I want to manipulate the system to my temporary advantage”, but “We have a general problem and as much as possible, we should try to regulate the question of election financing by consensus”.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160103"> As much as possible, the participants in politics, the political parties, should try to create institutions and methods of operation and establish a broad basis of consensus and stability that would allow us to proceed in a way that no one would be able to suggest that somehow, for reasons of temporary advantage of one kind or another, we would make a change, a change that would be seen to be benefiting one political party as opposed to another.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1160104">We all know that nothing could be more subversive of our democratic process than to have a party in government suddenly decide that it would change the rules, so it would completely undermine the position, the credibility and the ability of other parties to operate in that system.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160105">I make no secret of my friendship with Mr. Davis and of my great admiration for him. He and I have since had occasion to work together on many different tasks and projects, including most recently the report that we wrote on improving higher education in the province of Ontario. </ParaText><ParaText id="1160106">I know Mr. Davis continues to regard me as philosophically misguided, as he would put it, but nevertheless our friendship remains very strong. I have great admiration for his sense of occasion and his sense of critical times in the life of the province. He was not simply going to exercise partisan advantage in order to achieve something. He was going to be doing something on behalf of all the people of the province. No issue reflected this more significantly than the question of election financing.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160107">I could tell a similar story about the changes in the federal law and the federal rules, the decision by Prime Minister Chrétien to make a very significant change, which was carried through. It is notable, for example, that the proclamation of the date of that change was delayed so it would not negatively impact a leadership contest then under way in the Conservative Party of Canada. That was, again, an example of someone saying, “Let's recognize that we're not going to take advantage of this to simply punish a party which is now undergoing a political battle”.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160108">I entered the contest for the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada under a certain set of rules. Those rules were not made by me. They were not written by me. They had nothing to do with me in a sense. They were passed by the Parliament of Canada. I assumed those rules would apply to the leadership contest, which I was entering, for the full time of that contest.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160109">I do not say this directly when I look at my friends, including my colleagues who are here from the Conservative Party and my friends from the New Democratic Party and the Bloc.</ParaText><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="1160110">I became a candidate under legislation approved by the Parliament of Canada and very clear rules. The rules said that there was a $5,400 limit on individual contributions and that the contributions could be made up to 18 months after the convention. The law was very clear, unequivocal and transparent, and it was passed by the Parliament of the day.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="45">(1045)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="1160111">To put it mildly, I and a number of other leadership candidates were shocked. It woke me up to how the new government plays the game of politics. In the middle of the period in which we were raising money for the leadership and engaged in the leadership race itself, the Conservatives changed the law in such a way that for the entire 18 month period after the convention we were no longer allowed to collect cheques of $5,400. We were only allowed to collect cheques of $1,100.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160112">I want to tell everyone in this chamber and anyone else who wants to listen that there is no other interpretation that one can give to that unilateral change, joined in by the Bloc and approved and egged on by the New Democratic Party. There is no other way to interpret the timing of that law and the fact that it was not grandfathered for those who were participating in the leadership contest. There is no other way to interpret that law but as a deliberate attempt to undermine the credibility and integrity of the Liberal Party of Canada and to cause personal difficulty and embarrassment for each person who ran for the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada. It was a deliberate and flagrant attack on our political process in which we had all entered in terms of that race. </ParaText><ParaText id="1160113">The member for <Affiliation DbId="78351" Type="2">Cambridge</Affiliation> is laughing. Let him laugh because for him to change the rules in the middle of the game is just a laughing matter.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160114"><B>Mr. Gary Goodyear:</B> You were taking money from kids, Bob.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160115"><B>Hon. Bob Rae:</B> I will say to the hon. member that if we are on the other side, I hope we will not do what they have done to us. To change the contribution limits, when people ran campaigns on the assumption that financing would be possible, and then to change those rules and those limits in the middle of the game when we had all taken the personal risk that we take when we go into a leadership race, is simply disgraceful. I must confess that it has affected, for all time, my view of what the party opposite is really all about. I think I now understand what it is all about, what it is trying to do to us and what it is trying to do to the democratic process.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160116">The Conservatives can shout down, heckle and comment any way they want but I will not be cowed nor bullied by them into not stating what I know to be the truth. The government opposite interfered in this process because it had a political agenda. That is what it is all about. There is no way that anyone in his or her right mind would support the government in any effort it makes with respect to the project that is now under way with Bill <Document DbId="3120196" Type="3">C-29</Document> and the statements it is making about the current law with respect to Elections Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="1160117">The member opposite is not sitting in his chair and I am not sure he is allowed to heckle from anywhere in the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160118"><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!</ParaText><ParaText id="1160119"><B>Hon.

					<Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Rae" id="2532831"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="120535" Type="2">Hon. Bob Rae</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1160121">Mr. Speaker, I want to deal with a couple of arguments that have been made.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160122">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78531" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> just made a comment about the importance of using banks rather than individuals to make loans. I have no particular problem with that amendment to the act. It does not affect things one way or the other.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160123">However, the one comment he made, which he needs to think about, is when he said that it would take big money out of politics, which means that anybody could gain access to the same amount of money. The hon. member needs to think realistically about what security banks will be asking for with respect to getting a loan and what that really means.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160124">If the member is saying that this would take big money out, I would say that it does not. However, if the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78531" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> wants to take the money factor out of a leadership race entirely, the one way in which it can be done is to apply the philosophy in the Elections Act to leadership races, which is to say that there should be, as there is in the United States, public contributions for leadership races just as there are public contributions for our own campaigns at the national level.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160125">Speaking, I hope, in a less partisan fashion at this moment, if I were to make a practical suggestion to the House, having gone through this race, and I do not say this with any sense of pride, having managed to get through a very extensive process of begging and pleading with friends and people who used to be friends and getting them to make contributions, there is one flaw in the legislation. When my friends in the Conservative Party, the New Democratic Party or the Bloc Québécois have a leadership race they will all have the same experience we did. </ParaText><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="1160126">They will have to deal with the same circumstances and challenges as us. They will see that if a party wants to conduct a nation-wide campaign, if that party wants its campaign to reach every riding in this great land, that costs money. If the funds do not come from our families, from personal sources, and from contributors, and if they want a democratic campaign, then I believe there has to be more public funding for leadership races, just like there is for political parties.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160127">With all due respect, I wanted to focus on two points about this change. The first is that it is not fair to change the rules in the middle of the game. That is not fair. They can do it, and they have even done it twice now, but it is not fair, and I have to say that. This is an example of injustice toward a political party. If they want to punish a political party, they can. But if they start playing that kind of game, it could have some negative consequences.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160128">The second point I really want to make is about an important reform that has not been proposed in this bill: public funding. I am not talking about full funding, but a contribution from the public for leadership campaigns. I hope that will be in place before the next Bloc Québécois, NDP or Conservative Party leadership race because I think it is important for the Canadian democratic process.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160129">That is all I have to say, and I appreciate the opportunity to take part in this debate.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Reid" id="2532860"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78620" Type="2">Mr. Scott Reid (Lanark—Frontenac—Lennox and Addington, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1160130">Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="120535" Type="2">Toronto Centre</Affiliation> for a very informative speech. It is the kind of speech I myself would have given if I were looking forward to contesting a leadership race in the next year or so and was going to rely upon a large amount of donated cash. </ParaText><ParaText id="1160131">I want to talk about a couple of things. One is the idea that Jean Chrétien was being fair and thoughtful when he put forward this finance legislation. We should be clear about what was going on. The legislation that was put forward would have gone into effect, although the Chief Electoral Officer had some discretion on it, on December 31, 2003. Any race that might be underway could be declared to go before or after. The Chief Electoral Officer chose to cause the old financing rules with unlimited donations and unlimited spending to apply.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160132">That was not done out of fairness. That was done to ensure the member for <Affiliation DbId="78625" Type="2">Newmarket—Aurora</Affiliation>, who at that point was running for the leadership of the Conservative Party, would have a huge advantage over the current <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in that leadership race. It was a complete abuse of process and no one should misunderstand what was going on on that occasion.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160133">With regard to the fairness of the underlying system, there was nothing fair about the process that Jean Chrétien proposed of providing public financing on a sliding scale based on how many votes one got in the previous election, thereby locking in the advantage of the governing party; $1.75 per year to each party per vote it received in the previous election. Regardless of how voters might feel in the future, there is nothing fair about that. It locks in an incumbent's advantage. The longer the next Parliament lasts, the bigger the advantage adds up to be and the larger the number of votes a party has the bigger the advantage.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160134">What was fair about that as compared to what Ed Broadbent proposed where one would have the ability to indicate where one's particular subsidy would go based upon one's ongoing preferences? That was a much fairer suggestion which was shot down by the Liberals at that time.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160135">Similarly, the rebate of 60% of expenses to candidates, rewards those who are able to spend more. What is fair about that? What about this does not have the effect of benefiting those who have the most to spend and the most ability to borrow?</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="55">(1055)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Lee" id="2532862"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Mr. Derek Lee</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1160136">Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

That is the first one was with respect to using the last election as the basis upon which to document the public contributions because it is an objective basis. It is a basis of what the support was in an election, a democratic contest in which people have expressed themselves. That is just the reality. Would there be another way of doing it? Yes, I suppose there would be but that is one objective criterion.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160141">If we look at other countries in terms of how public funding is allocated, it is the same principle applied, which is that the level of public funding depends upon the level achieved in a democratic process. The same is true with respect to the contributions. None of these things are fixed for all time.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160142"> If the member opposite is saying that the government would like to look at those contributions and at the legislation overall, I would invite the government, instead of bringing in these little amendments here and there, which are designed to appeal to one party on the other side or not and give a temporary advantage, to put the subject matter of election financing in front of an all party committee and let us have an agreement that we will not see this as a partisan issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160143">I really do not see this as a partisan issue nor do I see it as a personal issue. I have done my bit and I have no personal issues. I am not here out of any personal gripe. I am here because I think what has animated the government is a desire for temporary political advantage.</ParaText><ParaText id="1160144">I do not know whether that has animated other governments in the past or not. I only know what I see and I think that is a very unhealthy feature. It is a perfect example of how not to reform the election financing process. The election financing process should be something in which all political parties can be seen to be participating and there is no particular advantage to one party or another. That is an approach that I would strongly advocate for now and certainly advocate for the future.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="00">(1100)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Tonks" id="2532867"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78347" Type="2">Mr. Alan Tonks</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1162666">Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

We would have liked to make certain amendments, but they were not approved. I will mention them in my speech.</ParaText><ParaText id="1162966">It is important to keep in mind that, ever since it arrived in this House, the Bloc Québécois has been fighting to put an end to corporate funding and limit individual contributions, as Quebec did 30 years ago.</ParaText><ParaText id="1162967">Earlier, I listened as the Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="120535" Type="2">Toronto Centre</Affiliation> talked about his leadership race, the difficulty of getting funding, and so on. Quebec has had legislation in place for 30 years. In Quebec, political parties successfully hold leadership races, raise funds and run election campaigns, all without corporate funding or huge contributions from individuals </ParaText><ParaText id="1162968">That is where the problem lies. With Bill <Document DbId="2158135" Type="3">C-2, An Act providing for conflict of interest rules, restrictions on election financing and measures respecting administrative transparency, oversight and accountability</Document>, the Conservative Party tried to correct the situation. The Conservatives were in a hurry. They had just been elected and had promised transparency and accountability legislation. We remember this bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="1162969">We warned them at the time about their Bill <Document DbId="2158135" Type="3">C-2</Document>. And we were not alone. Democracy Watch, an organization made up of democracy experts, also pointed to problems in the bill. Obviously, among the problems are the famous loans. Even if individual contributions are limited to $1,100 a year, this is not an improvement if individuals can make loans to get around the law. That is very worrisome.</ParaText><ParaText id="1162970">I will say it again. Earlier, I was listening to the speech by the Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="120535" Type="2">Toronto Centre</Affiliation>, a candidate in his party's leadership race, who told us it was unfair. Before it was reduced to $1,100 per individual, the contribution limit stood at $5,400 per individual and corporations were allowed a separate amount. He finds the bill to be unfair. However, he is one of the members who received a loan from an individual. His brother, among others, lent him $400,000. This is just as unfair as individuals being able to contribute $5,400 or $1,100 to a leadership or other campaign and getting around the limit by saying that the limit does not apply if the money is given as a loan.</ParaText><ParaText id="1162971">That is what Bill <Document DbId="3120196" Type="3">C-29</Document> seeks to remedy. In law, there is a principle that ignorance of the law is no excuse. However, there is also a principle that you cannot do indirectly what cannot be done directly. That is an argument we raised with the Conservative government with respect to its Bill <Document DbId="2158135" Type="3">C-2</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1162972">It is a good thing to adopt a limit of $1,100 for individuals and to prohibit corporations from contributing to election campaigns. That is perfect. It is similar to Quebec's law. However, we should not allow loans that would permit individuals to do indirectly what cannot be done directly. If the contribution limit is $1,100 per individual, tomorrow morning we cannot say to an individual that the limit does not apply, that he can lend hundreds of thousand of dollars and that it is not a problem if he makes it a loan. He could declare that it is a loan and that the means will be found to repay it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1162973">Today, it is understandable that the <Affiliation DbId="105459" Type="96">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>—the member for <Affiliation DbId="78331" Type="2">Saint-Laurent—Cartierville</Affiliation>—and the member for <Affiliation DbId="120535" Type="2">Toronto Centre</Affiliation> have not been able to repay the debts incurred to participate in the leadership race. Nor should Canadians be fooled. I know that the Chief Electoral Officer did not make public the agreement he had with the leadership candidates; however they have not yet repaid their debts.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1162974">I repeat, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="120535" Type="2">Toronto Centre</Affiliation> said earlier that he has run in several provincial election campaigns and that he was a party leader in Ontario. He also said that anyone who runs in a leadership race will have funding problems. </ParaText><ParaText id="1162975">Perhaps he had a problem. He was in the NDP and became a Liberal. I understand why many Liberal supporters might not have wanted to contribute to his election campaign. Perhaps he chose the wrong party. Only time will tell, but, during a leadership race and an election, the individuals involved must be reliable and obey the law. In other words, candidates must be able to raise enough money from enough supporters to campaign responsibly in an election, and the same goes for a leadership race.</ParaText><ParaText id="1162976">It forces the people who want to become party leaders to expand their circle of supporters. If they are unable to bring in more supporters, they might as well stay at home. It is not complicated. It is as simple as that. If a leadership candidate estimates that it will cost $500,000, he or she needs 500 people to contribute $1,000 each. And any candidate who cannot do so does not deserve to run in the leadership race. That is it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1162977">In my view, it only makes sense and shows respect for individuals, and it prevents one individual or group of individuals from being able to control a candidate in a leadership race or an election. It is only logical, simple and honest, and it also means that anyone can hope to enter politics one day. They must understand that, in order to run an election campaign, candidates must have people who trust them and they must be able to raise between $80,000 and $100,000. Thus, one must be able to raise funds, like I do and like all Bloc members do.</ParaText><ParaText id="1162978">Indeed, we use public financing—spaghetti dinners and suppers, sugar shacks and so on—and some 100, 200 or 300 people come out and generously give us $20. That is how, over the years, we are able to raise funds. That is why Bloc Québécois members, like the Conservatives, are probably among those with the best backing. We also probably receive the most money from individual contributors, men and women who are thrilled to come to a Bloc Québécois fundraising activity and give $20, knowing that $7 or $8 will go towards funding, depending on the cost of the meal.</ParaText><ParaText id="1162979">With these small amounts of money, we can raise funds for an election campaign. It is simple. I can understand that the Liberals and Conservatives are not used to that, since for them, it is clearly the “establishment”, only a few individuals, that has run the party. These people were able to make some very large contributions. </ParaText><ParaText id="1162980">So I am not surprised. What surprises me most, is that the member for <Affiliation DbId="120535" Type="2">Toronto Centre</Affiliation>, a former member of the Ontario NDP, was also collecting money from some individuals. He was not used to grassroots fundraising, which surprises me about a former NDP member.</ParaText><ParaText id="1162981">In this House, surprises are not uncommon. Every day, the Conservatives bring us revelation after revelation. It is clear that the way the Conservatives wanted to govern is looking more and more like the way the Liberals were running things. I can see that the NDP had a way of running things that is similar to the Liberals' and the Conservatives' way. Regardless, that is the problem of the federalist parties in this House. It is not the problem of the Bloc Québécois, which is used to grassroots financing. </ParaText><ParaText id="1162982">The members of the Bloc Québécois worked very hard to get Bill <Document DbId="3120196" Type="3">C-29</Document> passed. Why? Because in Quebec, for 30 years, grassroots fundraising has dominated, since René Lévesque, the leader of the Parti Québécois, implemented election legislation that prevents lobbyists from controlling politics. This legislation completely changed politics in Quebec. It ensures that politics must be supported by fundraising among the public. </ParaText><ParaText id="1162983">If an individual is not able to get funding to run a campaign from the largest possible number of individual men and women, he or she does not deserve to be in power. That is what I would tell the Liberals, in particular the member for <Affiliation DbId="120535" Type="2">Toronto Centre</Affiliation>, who was offended that the amount for individual contributions was reduced in the middle of the race. Except that, thanks to the $400,000 loan he received from his brother, he did not need funding.</ParaText><ParaText id="1162984">He needs it now, because he had 18 months to repay his debt. He was counting on the $5,400 per person that he was allowed to collect. But along the way, the $5,400 became $1,100.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1162985">I can understand that it is hard for him to find Liberal supporters to pay off his campaign debt, because he is not a real Liberal.</ParaText><ParaText id="1162986">In some ways, it is disappointing that not everyone in this House realizes that politics should be open to every man and woman, to every citizen. It is not a matter of money, friends or anything like that. It takes someone who is able to express their ideas and defend them, someone that many people around them or in their party are able to trust.</ParaText><ParaText id="1162987">That is how we should run elections and that is how the Bloc Québécois does it. We convince hundreds and thousands of people to become members of our organization and to make donations to enable us to run election campaigns based on defending the values and interests of Quebec. That is why, once again, as in election to election since 1993, our party has the most representatives from Quebec in this House. It is precisely because we are always in contact with the public, with the people we represent. We call on them for financing and it takes a great number of supporters, people who can trust us, to build up the money for our election campaigns.</ParaText><ParaText id="1162988">The other parties will probably have to follow our example. Quebec is often a model of innovation for the rest of Canada, as hon. members know. One such innovation came from René Lévesque and was included in the electoral legislation that he was responsible for over 30 years ago. It bans corporate donations and limits individual donations.</ParaText><ParaText id="1162989">This bill is the logical next step to what we sovereignists in Quebec defend. In politics, we have to be able to convince as many people as possible. The best way to do so is to limit individual contributions. We cannot allow a dozen or so people to give us $10,000 each to enable us to run an election campaign. We have to broaden our network.</ParaText><ParaText id="1162990">When the Conservatives passed Bill <Document DbId="2158135" Type="3">C-2</Document>, we told them that, if individuals may not invest more than $1,100 in an election campaign annually, we absolutely cannot allow them to do so indirectly by handing out loans. That is why the Conservatives have amended that in Bill <Document DbId="3120196" Type="3">C-29</Document>. We cannot prohibit people from making donations greater than $1,100, while allowing them to lend as much money as they want and saying this is just fine. This bill corrects that.</ParaText><ParaText id="1162991">We demanded—and we obtained this amendment at second reading of Bill <Document DbId="3120196" Type="3">C-29</Document>—that political parties not be liable for their candidates' debts. Obviously, be it an election campaign, a leadership race or a personal election campaign, it is not right that a political party be held responsible for debts that a candidate may have contracted with banks or otherwise and not from individuals.</ParaText><ParaText id="1162992">The Conservatives decided to reverse course, with the NDP's support. That is why I find it difficult to understand the NDP. It sees itself as a grassroots party but has, I believe, a hard time fundraising. This party now has the Conservatives' support to withdraw the amendment that we presented. That means that henceforth a political party would be responsible for its candidates' debts to financial institutions, if ever they were not paid back.</ParaText><ParaText id="1162993">Once again, when people run as candidates, they must be able to prove that they can find sufficient support. Therefore, it is normal that if a candidate borrows from a financial institution to fund an election campaign, that candidate is responsible because it is their election campaign. Under this bill, parties would be required to cover any unpaid debts.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1162994">This means that the people who run as candidates might not necessarily be the best. They would not need popular support. They would not need to fundraise to reimburse their debts. Inevitably, they would only have to run as candidates, knowing full well that if they do not raise enough money, the party will pay off their debt.</ParaText><ParaText id="1162995">I will say it again: the Bloc Québécois was against this position. That is why we proposed amendments. It is difficult to understand why the Conservatives did not agree to them. Perhaps they also have trouble with grassroots fundraising in individual ridings. They are better at collecting money as the party in power. We see it with the Couillard affair in Quebec, the Kevlar situation concerning land in Quebec City that Ms. Couillard apparently pushed for. Basically, we can understand that much of the money going into the coffers comes from the way in which the Conservatives engage in politics, which means that they probably have difficulty with grassroots fundraising.</ParaText><ParaText id="1162996">Of course, that is not the Bloc Québécois' case. We are proud to say that every day, we rise in this House to defend the interests and values of Quebeckers. We do not need to be in power to do that. Citizens are the ones who give us real power. The only power we should be able to accept is the power entrusted to us by the people. The people can take it away whenever they want because it does not belong to us. The people lend us power, and we are here every day to stand up for the people.</ParaText><ParaText id="1162997">I have a hard time every time I see a Quebec Conservative rise and say something that is not in line with the interests and values of Quebeckers. That is what has been happening with the EDC file. The <Affiliation DbId="79001" Type="96">Minister of Labour and Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec</Affiliation>, the minister responsible for the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean region, typically takes a stance that opposes what was passed unanimously. It gets even worse. Quebec's minister of regional development, Mr. Bachand, is engaged in an open war with the Minister of Labour because at some point, the latter decided that he no longer respected the Quebec consensus on economic development.</ParaText><ParaText id="1162998">Quebec's non-profit organizations are our way of diversifying our economy and giving certain responsibilities to non-political organizations that exist not to engage in politics, but to work on community development, to make decisions about what kinds of businesses and economic interventions are needed in each region. The <Affiliation DbId="79001" Type="96">Minister of Labour and Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec</Affiliation> decided that the government would no longer fund these organizations, would no longer help them. He decided that he would make direct payments instead.</ParaText><ParaText id="1162999">That is very hard to accept. I can see how he might have trouble getting grassroots funding from the people after taking such a position in the House. All of the other Conservative members from Quebec support him. This kind of policy is contrary to the values and interests of Quebeckers. I can see that they are getting more and more out of touch. Raising funds is getting harder and harder for them. Nevertheless, the law must not permit impunity.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163000">Once again, we had hoped that the Conservatives would understand that it is not up to the party to repay a debt incurred by a candidate. Especially since the party now receives $2 per voter, which means that the candidate's debt will be paid by our citizens because that $2 contribution to the political party comes from the government. It would be taxpayers' money repaying candidates' debts.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163001">The Bloc Québécois would never have accepted such a situation. We would never have allowed taxpayers' money to repay an election debt. That is what the Conservative Party has done with the help of the NDP. I have a great deal of difficulty with this, especially coming from the NDP, which calls itself the champion of the people and of the people's interests.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163002">I have a great deal of difficulty with the idea of allowing taxes—through a $2 per taxpayer contribution to political parties—to be used to repay a candidate's debt. The candidate would no longer have to fundraise because he or she would think, “If I ever go into debt, then the party will automatically pay it back out of the money provided by the government.” I have a great deal of difficulty understanding that. But, once again, it is typical of the NDP to signal that they are turning left and then turn right. They always do that. I see that they decided to turn right with the Conservatives. They will have to suffer the consequences and live with that decision in the next election.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1163003">Obviously, we will support Bill <Document DbId="3120196" Type="3">C-29</Document>. We wanted our amendment—that would not permit a candidate's debt to be repaid by the party, given that the contribution of $2 per voter is paid by the government—to be adopted. We would have liked that amendment to pass. However, once again, the Conservatives and the NDP decided to oppose it. As for the Bloc Québécois, we will always respect the interests of Quebeckers.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Wrzesnewskyj" id="2533311"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78467" Type="2">Mr. Borys Wrzesnewskyj (Etobicoke Centre, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1163004">Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak to Bill <Document DbId="3120196" Type="3">C-29, An Act to amend the Canada Elections Act (accountability with respect to loans)</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163005"> Over the last number of years since 2003, we have seen a series of pieces of legislation and amendments to legislation dealing with the whole issue of election funding and financing. These pieces of legislation have attempted to provide transparency in our electoral process and prevent undue influence. Those are the two component parts.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163006">Both parts are extremely important. Not only should the democratic process be transparent, but it also has to be a process that does not allow undue influence.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163007">I wish to clarify where the differentiation is between those two elements. For instance, we have been watching the presidential electoral process in the United States. We have heard that this process is going to be the first billion dollar presidential election.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163008">There are many pieces of legislation and many regulations that deal with the issue of transparency, but when the people of the United States, along with many people in other countries who look to the democracies with hope, see a system that appears to be almost a “dollarocracy”, it is worrisome.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163009">Thus, it is quite important that these pieces of legislation which we have been enacting address both of those issues so that they in fact strengthen our Canadian democracy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163010">Are undue influence and lack of transparency an issue, or have they been an issue, here in Canada? I would have liked to believe that these sorts of things would not happen in Canada, but in fact just this past winter and spring we saw the spectacle of the unfortunate Schreiber-Mulroney relationship.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163011"> One of the aspects that perhaps was not given enough attention was a former leadership convention, which provided Mr. Schreiber, because of a lack of transparency, with the opportunity to influence an historic outcome for this country. Offshore moneys were used to influence the outcome of a leadership campaign in one of Canada's major parties.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163012">Quite clearly, that one example demonstrates that we need to have a transparent process. In fact, we could use another example that is a little closer in time, because at this point neither Mr. Clark nor Mr. Mulroney are in this House. They no longer occupy the political positions of power that they have in the past. However, in 2002, the current <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> underwent a leadership process that was not transparent.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163013">I would like to believe that there was no undue influence. I believe that all of us want to assume and believe that, but now, with the example of Mulroney and Schreiber, as I have said, we see that these things have happened in the past. </ParaText><ParaText id="1163014">It begs the question of why the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> would not want to address that particular issue. I know he is not required to by law, but there is the very fact that he does not wish to come clean. </ParaText><ParaText id="1163015">There is a higher standard that we expect of our elected officials. To have responsible government, we must have confidence in our ministers and especially in our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, our first minister. Quite clearly, it is necessary to have laws that provide this sort of transparency.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163016">Then there is the whole issue of undue influence. As we know, electoral processes culminate with election day when collectively we as a people gather, travel to the vote locations and cast our ballots. At the end of the day and the end of the process, the people have decided.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1163017">People decide, based upon a campaign during which they have had the opportunity to listen and to examine party platforms, whether a party leader inspires with a vision for the future and whether locally the candidates speak to the hopes, dreams and principles upon which the local communities are built and believe in.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163018">However, we know that to communicate one's vision is not an inexpensive process. There is a cost to communicating with the public and if we are unable to communicate with the public then we undermine the democratic process.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163019">We need the money and the resources to get out there, to meet with people and to give people a sense of who we are, where we stand as a party and where the leader wishes to take the country. </ParaText><ParaText id="1163020">It would be tremendously unfortunate if single individuals or corporations had the ability, through donations or loans, to influence potential candidates or parties because of their ability to provide large sums of money for their campaigns. Therefore, I think there is a clear case of why we need this sort of legislation, and Canada seems to be at the forefront. It is encouraging that we have been working on this process.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163021">However, we now need to ask whether this most recent legislation addresses those issues. Have we perhaps gone a step too far, to the point where it acts as a brake on our democratic processes, prevents individuals from putting themselves forward as candidates or as leadership candidates or prevents people who perhaps have a point of view that better fits with one of the smaller parties, such as the Green Party or other parties that are out there?</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1163022">Does the legislation act in a way that is conducive to the democratic process or are we at the point where, inadvertently, or perhaps, as some would say cynically, advertently, we have begun undermining the very process?</ParaText><ParaText id="1163023">Let us take a look at what, in this legislation, are some of the unintended consequences may be.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163024"> We are in an era right now of minority governments and, although politics are unpredictable, we can assume that over the next period of time we may be in a situation of minority governments. </ParaText><ParaText id="1163025">When it comes to actual fundraising, we do not necessarily face a campaign every four years, providing enough time to raise, whether it is locally, the $70,000 approximately that is required for a campaign, we have a series of sequential elections in much shorter timeframes. </ParaText><ParaText id="1163026">With a limit of $1,100 per donation, it has made it incredibly difficult for many people to step forward as candidates. For many people it has now become a barrier that prevents them from putting themselves forward. There is the question of whether $1,100 is the barrier that we should put in place or should it be $2,500, especially when it comes to leadership campaigns. It is difficult to make the argument that $1,100 is the perfect amount.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163027">We are in a world of minority governments. We have set the barrier very high with this very low limit of $1,100, so we have forced candidates into the situation of having to go out and look for loans. This legislation proposes to put limits on where and how one could go about doing this. Unfortunately, it has a series of unintended consequences that are corrosive to the democratic process. </ParaText><ParaText id="1163028">Each one of us here have a group of volunteers in our riding associations, tremendous people who believe in their candidates, their parties, their platforms and want to be part of the process. This legislation would entail a requirement that they provide loan guarantees to banks for loans that are necessary for election campaigns.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163029">Many of these volunteers are not people of modest means. They are people of conviction. It would be a terrible situation if we limited the ability, not just of candidates, but the ability of people to engage in a formal manner in political parties unless they were people of modest means and willing to take on this sort of guarantee risk with financial institutions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163030">Probably some of the most wonderful volunteers over the years with whom I have dealt were not people of modest means but they were people of principle and character. These are the people this type of legislation would now prevent from taking part in the process. We have almost come full circle. </ParaText><ParaText id="1163031">By wanting to ensure that big money would not have undue influence so the average Canadian, a person of conviction, could take part in the process, we are now preventing those individuals from taking part in the process. We then take the unfortunate step of saying that it is only big money, the banks, that can provide the financial loans for electoral campaigns. That is truly an undesirable consequence.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1163032">I heard my NDP colleague from Winnipeg Centre state that, from a position of principle, he supports this because it would prevent unions from providing loans, just as it would prevent corporations. It is to be lauded that he approaches this with that mind frame. However, the legislation would prevent unions and most corporations from providing loans but not banks. I am sure many members in this House have over the years been lobbied by unions. As he stated, it is an uncomfortable situation because if a union has provided members with a loan then, at some point, as legislators they would need to sit through a union presentation on particular issues of interest. </ParaText><ParaText id="1163033">Why would we want to provide banks, which lobby in very sophisticated ways and sometimes not very transparent ways, with that additional clout?</ParaText><ParaText id="1163034">I can imagine how difficult it might be in certain ridings where there are not a lot of bank branches, especially some of our northern ridings where perhaps someone lives in one small particular community how it would feel for a candidate to have to go to the local bank branch manager and talk about a loan. If we truly intended to address the issue of undue influence of those who would provide loans, we would have spent a little more time, instead of trying to rush this legislation, thinking it through. Perhaps we need an arm's length body whose sole purpose would be to provide loans to campaigns and not not lobby members of Parliament. It would prevent undue influence.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163035">I have just thrown that idea out and it is something we should perhaps look at in the future. However, as I have just referenced, this seems to have moved very quickly and not truly been thought through in a collective manner where all the parties sat down, discussed it and tried to go about this in a way in which we truly could have addressed the issues of transparency and undue influence. </ParaText><ParaText id="1163036">Unfortunately, besides the inadvertent consequences, perhaps there were some cynical reasons for this legislation. It does not inspire confidence when we see some of the past tactics that have been used by the Conservative government when it comes to this whole issue of finance. I reference the disappointing situation of not being provided with open books on the 2002 leadership campaign of the current <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. It would be tremendous if he set an example but, unfortunately, that is not forthcoming. Therefore, we take it with a grain of salt when there is such tremendous interest to pass this legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163037">We also note that the Conservative Party truly is the party of big money now because its coffers are overflowing. We should note that the parties have the ability to provide loans to their various candidates. We often talk about democratic deficit in this House and how members of Parliament have been diminished in their role because of the strength of the central party apparatus, the so-called party backroom boys, and this has just provided another lever to ensuring there is limited independence of thought. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1163038">What we note here is that there are parties which virtually do not have an ability to provide that sort of financing. I mentioned the Green Party earlier. It does not have the same sort of resources and there are other parties, other points of view. I can imagine how difficult it would be for those particular candidates, from those parties, when it came time to get their executive together, to walk over to the local bank branch manager and to convince him or her that at some point in time they would have the ability to repay the loans required to run a $70,000 campaign.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163039">There appears to be even more cynicism in this because we see and have heard on tape the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> reference how two high-powered backroom operators within the Conservative Party approached a potential candidate with financial considerations. It does not inspire confidence in this particular piece of legislation brought forward by a government whose party's head office potentially engages in those sorts of activities and a Prime Minister who is not willing to come forward with his own leadership campaign details.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163040">Many have insinuated that big oil and gas perhaps provided financing for that particular campaign. I just cannot imagine why the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> would not want to put to rest those sorts of insinuations, a Prime Minister who talks about accountability so often would want to be transparent to set an example.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163041">People say that was in the past and that these cannot be done retroactively. Of course, but he could also set an example, show true leadership, especially on these issues and especially in this era when we have heard of things that we could never have imagined half a year ago. Once again, I would like to reference how Mr. Mulroney's relationship with Mr. Schreiber and the leadership convention undermined our electoral processes here in the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163042">In conclusion, there are tremendously negative and corrosive inadvertent consequences to this particular piece of legislation and it does the exact opposite of its stated intention.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Maloney" id="2533336"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78608" Type="2">Mr. John Maloney (Welland, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1163043">Mr. Speaker, the hon. member referenced the current <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s leadership campaign expenses.

It would straitjacket. And it would not just straitjacket and prohibit individuals but, as the member pointed out, parties. </ParaText><ParaText id="1163055">We would now have a limited spectrum of political debate in this country.

The candidates, potentially, and they would not want to do that I am sure, could walk away from these outstanding loans.

It should not have been rushed through. It should have been thought through. I hate to have to say this, but it appears that this particular legislation is a cynical attempt to freeze in a particular advantage of one particular party at this point in time. It is a tremendous disservice to anyone who believes in a democratic process. </ParaText><ParaText id="1163061">As has been stated over and over, the Liberal Party is against this piece of legislation. We will stand up for the small people in this country.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. McGuinty" id="2533350"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78527" Type="2">Mr. David McGuinty (Ottawa South, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1163062">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to debate Bill <Document DbId="3120196" Type="3">C-29, An Act to amend the Canada Elections Act (accountability with respect to loans)</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163063">There are aspects of the bill which I support. In fact, when it returned from committee, the bill had been amended in such a fashion that I might have been unable to support it at third reading. Unfortunately, the government, with the help of the NDP, undid three very sensible amendments which would have improved the bill. It remains a mystery to us why the NDP members would want to sidle up with the Reform Conservative movement in Canada today. I still think that they have to justify to their supporters and Canadians at large why they might undermine this progressive piece of legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163064">As a result of those amendments and the NDP support of the government, and for many reasons, I will not be able to give Bill <Document DbId="3120196" Type="3">C-29</Document> my support on the vote at third reading.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163065">The majority of the bill comes from recommendations in a report from the Chief Electoral Officer to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. That, by the way, would be the same Chief Electoral Officer, a highly accomplished lifetime public servant whom the government derided because of its own legislation dealing with veiled voting. However, we will leave that for another debate.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163066">In that report the Chief Electoral Officers found that when loans are given to a political candidate by a person who is not regularly in the business of lending money, it can be perceived by some as a means to influence the political process with money. The report made a series of recommendations to end this perception. All of us, I think, want to see that perception eliminated in Canadian society. We want to drive up trust in our democratic institutions and processes, not drive it down.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163067">One such recommendation was to ensure that all loans granted to a candidate were signed at the going commercial lending rate. A second was to establish a limit on loans made by individuals that would be equal to their annual political contribution amount. If we look at the year 2007, for example, that amount was $1,100. These measures are contained in Bill <Document DbId="3120196" Type="3">C-29</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163068">The bill will also ensure that corporations and unions are prevented from making loans to political candidates and parties, just as they have been prevented from making campaign contributions, a theme I will come back to in a moment.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163069">Bill <Document DbId="3120196" Type="3">C-29</Document> will ensure if an individual lends and donates money to any candidate that the sum total of his or her contributions and loans will count toward his or her maximum. For instance, a person will not be able to make a $1,000 loan and a $1,000 donation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163070">Yet another important recommendation made by the Chief Electoral Officer was that the information surrounding any loans be made public. Why? In order to mitigate the chances of a perceived conflict of interest, something that all of us as parliamentarians must fight against, again with the higher public interest in mind, that is, to drive up trust in democratic institutions and the democratic processes that bring us here.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163071">According to the report, the information to be disclosed should include the identity of the lender, the interest rate, and a repayment schedule for the loan, over what period of time, how much, with a beginning, a middle and an end to the schedule. The reason it is important to disclose this type of information throughout a campaign is that after a vote, while the information may be telling, it comes too late to help a voter make an informed decision about which candidate he or she may choose to support or not.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163072">I can support this measure in Bill <Document DbId="3120196" Type="3">C-29</Document>. It is the right thing to do. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1163073">In fact, for Canadians watching or reading <I>Hansard</I> at some point, let me take a moment to remind them it is the Liberal Party of Canada that was well ahead of the curve on this issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163074">During the last Liberal leadership race, our leadership candidates went way above and beyond the call of duty to disclose this type of information. It is an excellent idea. I strongly believe that the other parties in the House should be brought under the same type and level of scrutiny that the Liberal Party of Canada has voluntarily adopted.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163075">We have heard from numerous speakers this afternoon and throughout this debate specifically about the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. It is revealing. It is more than interesting. It is not somewhat passing that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has not yet revealed the names of the people and organizations that contributed to his leadership campaign in 2002. Why? Why would a leadership candidate not want to reveal the people and organizations supporting, in this case, his leadership bid? This kind of secrecy is exactly what leads many Canadians to become distrustful of the political process. </ParaText><ParaText id="1163076">Who exactly, they might ask, put the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> at the helm of the Conservative Party? Who? Who wrote the cheques? Which Conservative members? Was it the big oil companies? An objective Canadian might ask, is this why the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> continues to deny the existence of climate change? When faced with one of the greatest ecological threats of our time, in the wake of the loss of 2,500 of the highest paying jobs in the manufacturing sector in Canada, how does the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> respond? How does he respond to the climate change crisis facing the planet? With a talking oil stain that tells Canadians there is no point in trying to curb our greenhouse gas emissions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163077">It is actually encouraging. I encourage the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his party to pursue exactly those kinds of tactics. I encourage him to run those advertisements at every gas pump in every service station in the country. Why? Because Canadians would then see that the response to the climate change crisis by the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is a cartoon character. I ask him to please go forward in that regard and continue to proliferate those kinds of race to the bottom tactics.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163078">Was he funded, for example, by groups like Charles McVety's at the Canada Christian College, who was recently in Ottawa to help the government push through Bill <Document DbId="3085457" Type="3">C-10</Document>? That bill would give the Conservative government the right to censor Canadian films based on whatever they seem to find offensive. </ParaText><ParaText id="1163079">Or is it the same Charles McVety who actually cybersquatted on over 40 MPs websites, including my own? Having seized it, he was confronted by me, and was shamed into actually transferring mine back to me and the others back to the other members from all sides of the House, all parties? Dr. McVety, whatever his doctorate might be in, was opposed to the notion of same sex civil marriage and he used cyber theft and cybersquatting as his modus operandi to achieve his objectives. Is this the group that funded the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s leadership bid?</ParaText><ParaText id="1163080">We should know those things. If either of these are the case, I believe that Canadians deserve an answer. They have a right to know. I encourage my colleagues on the Conservative side of the House to urge their leader to disclose those contributions as quickly as possible. </ParaText><ParaText id="1163081">While they are at it, why do they not ask the <Affiliation DbId="111558" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> which sole contributor paid off up to half a million dollars of his leadership debt. One cheque, one donor, the amount has never been disclosed. The Minister of National Defence has never come clean with Canadians. </ParaText><ParaText id="1163082">It is no surprise that some of the measures we find in this bill are supported by the Conservatives.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1163083">Those are two examples and there may be more. That is exactly the kind of transparency the House should be seeking to increase, not decrease, to drive up trust in the democratic institutions and the processes that brought us here.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163084">I understand that members in the Conservative Party are not allowed to question their leader or even to express their own ideas, failing which we see the kind of despicable content which has emerged in the last 48 hours from the <Affiliation DbId="78964" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation>. On that note, we know the apology is not enough. It is not enough because it is not the first time.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163085">This is about restoring the faith of Canadians in the democratic process. Over the past five years the Liberal Party has done tremendous work, I believe, to help restore faith. It was in 2003 that the previous Liberal government introduced the very first annual limits on individual contributions to a political party and to our candidates. In that same bill we also banned contributions from corporations and unions to political parties. That is progressive. Those changes stand today as the most significant ones that have been made to political financing at the federal level in decades. We went further. </ParaText><ParaText id="1163086">In 2006 the maximum contribution amounts were lowered even further. They are now tied to the rate of inflation and in theory should rise slightly each year. I say “in theory” because we have yet to see if Canada's <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> will be able to steer the economy well enough to meet targeted inflation rates. Given his past behaviour at Queen's Park and his performance in the Ontario government, Canadians are of course deeply suspicious of an individual who increases provincial debt by $28 billion and leaves a $5.6 billion deficit in Canada's largest province.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163087">Nevertheless, we did support lowering those maximums, which brings me to the part of my speech where I have to raise my concerns about this bill. There is a danger that sometimes we, as legislators, in our zeal to make things better, often make things worse through a variety of unintended consequences.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163088">This bill, unfortunately, finds itself well across the line of what is needed in order to make things better. To their credit, the members from all sides of the House who studied the bill at committee stage tried to make the bill better. At least in this case it was not one of the six standing committees that have been filibustered, blocked, toyed with and brought into disrepute by the conduct of Conservative members, most recently of course in a number of standing committees with respect to their cheap and dishonest talk about carbon pricing.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163089">The members who studied the bill did try to make the bill better. There were, however, three amendments made at committee which the government did not agree with and which were eliminated at report stage, again with the help of the NDP. It is a shame because it was widely recognized that these amendments would have improved the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163090">One such amendment has to do with who is liable for loans that go unpaid. The Bloc and the Liberal members of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs were concerned that the original wording of the bill could have made political parties responsible for loans that their candidates took without even knowing that their candidates had taken those loans. Let me give an example. </ParaText><ParaText id="1163091">The local candidate takes out a $30,000 loan to finance his campaign. He does not inform the central Conservative Party that he is doing this. The central party, however, is now responsible for that loan should the candidate not win and declare bankruptcy. That is right; a political party would not have authorized the loan, would have had no knowledge of the loan, yet it would be required to assume liability for the loan if the candidate declared bankruptcy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163092">I do not think this is right. I actually do not even think it is legal, particularly when we consider that there are parties not represented in this House and for whom a $30,000 debt is an extremely high sum of money to be stuck with through no fault of their own. In short, this is not good for democracy. It does not give rise to the possibility of new political parties, for example.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1163093">That brings me to my last point. It is about who will be disenfranchised by Bill <Document DbId="3120196" Type="3">C-29</Document>. Every single politician cuts his or her teeth in politics by taking a chance and running for office. From a local councillor to a federal cabinet minister, we all start that way; everyone except, of course, for the Minister of Public Works, whom the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> appointed to the Senate and who, in his own words, did not feel like running for office.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163094">I will admit that in mounting a campaign for office some people will have advantages. They might have a recognizable name or face because of their past activities. There is nothing wrong with that, but it does give them an early advantage in getting the early stage donations that are so crucial to a candidacy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163095"> Others come to politics with a good amount of money in their bank accounts. That is neither a good thing nor a bad thing. Any political bodies should be represented by a broad spectrum of the citizens who vote them there. The advantage that these types of candidates will have, however, is that it will be far easier for them to secure loans from a financial institution to get their candidacy up and running. If they have a big house or other assets to use as collateral against a loan, the banks will be all too willing to give them that loan.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163096">Banks and financial institutions, of course, are the only places where federal political candidates will be allowed to secure loans for over $1,100 if Bill <Document DbId="3120196" Type="3">C-29</Document> passes. That would be for a nomination campaign, a leadership campaign or an election campaign.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163097">Then there is a third type of politician, one who runs for office without a lot of face recognition and without the benefit of having much wealth tucked away. These politicians run because they want to make a difference. They believe their ideas can help to shape the national debate. </ParaText><ParaText id="1163098">These are the candidates who would be disenfranchised by the bill. They do not have the face recognition needed to get a lot of early stage donations. They might not have the assets for a bank to give them a starter loan. In the case of a nomination battle for a riding, this could easily be the difference between launching a winning campaign and losing one.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163099">What about family and friends? Why can family and friends not support early funding start-up for nomination battles? This is exactly what has happened, for example, in our IT sector, where so much of our IT success has come from individuals with robust ideas who have drawn from family, friends, contacts and neighbours to help start up with a positive idea. I draw a parallel here between both.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163100"><B>An hon. member:</B> Keep Mulroney out of this.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163101"><B>Mr. David McGuinty: </B> Essentially what this bill does--</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

His long time adviser and confidant, Tom Flanagan, said as much in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> just two weeks ago. Let me quote from the editorial:</ParaText><ParaText id="1163106"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">--there would be fewer candidates. Only well-known candidates would be able to get start-up capital from banks....</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1163107">Therefore, the aim of the bill, which the NDP supports--and which I find outrageous--is to ensure that only well known candidates can run for federal office. Let us look at who will find it much harder to run for office should this bill pass. </ParaText><ParaText id="1163108">Many groups have said that women looking to run in a nomination contest would find it harder. A single mother who works to provide her kids with a decent apartment and a hopeful future will not be a prime candidate to secure a bank loan. She does not own her home or even a fancy car with which to back the loan.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163109"> She has a desire to run for office to make a difference for her kids and for millions of other Canadian children like hers. Maybe she would not be able to win. Who knows? Getting elected is not easy.

When is a loan not a loan? I will help him with the answer. A loan is not loan if it never gets repaid. It ceases to be a loan and becomes a donation, and it is an illegal donation if it is larger than $1,100.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163118">We are seeking to rub that out.

I would also like to congratulate my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78515" Type="2">Don Valley West</Affiliation>, who is the sponsoring member of the bill, for his dedication. It has been a pleasure working with him to advance Bill <Document DbId="3075383" Type="4">C-474</Document>. I would like to take this occasion to wish him well as he will soon embark on a new chapter in his life, a new career. Congratulations to him, through you, Mr. Speaker.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163158">I am pleased that all parties in the House were able to work together to show goodwill and a common commitment to environmental sustainability. Bill <Document DbId="3075383" Type="4">C-474</Document> will help to increase transparency and accountability and to improve federal sustainable development planning and reporting. </ParaText><ParaText id="1163159">The bill before us today would enable the government to better articulate its environmental sustainability priorities and to align the work of departments to support them. For the first time since the departmental sustainable development strategies were introduced in 1995, there will be an overarching federal sustainable development strategy to set the direction for the supporting departmental strategies. Federal departments will all be rowing in the same direction, together. </ParaText><ParaText id="1163160">The forthcoming federal strategy will contain federal goals and targets for sustainable development, along with implementation strategies for each department. This approach will ensure government transparency and accountability for progress to advance sustainable development.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163161">Indeed, the development of a federal sustainable development strategy is long overdue. There have been a number of commitments over the years to develop one. The first commitment was at the earth summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1995. This commitment was reiterated at the 2002 world summit on sustainable development in Johannesburg, South Africa. The government is very pleased to meet this international commitment through this legislation and to have been able to work with all the political parties for its development.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163162">The bill would also respond to numerous calls by the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development to develop a federal strategy. The commissioner has often likened the existing approach to sustainable development planning in Canada to trying to assemble a large jigsaw puzzle without the picture on the box. The legislation would finally provide that overarching picture.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163163">In addition to the development and implementation of a federal sustainable development strategy, the bill includes a number of important elements that would serve to advance sustainable development here in Canada. For example, the bill calls for the establishment of a new office within Environment Canada to develop and monitor progress on the federal sustainable development strategy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163164">The bill would also establish a sustainable development advisory council with a broad membership that would include provincial and territorial, aboriginal and non-government representatives, as well as representatives from business and labour communities.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1163165">Bill <Document DbId="3075383" Type="4">C-474</Document> outlines an important oversight role for cabinet in the development and implementation of the federal strategy. This again will increase accountability for progress on sustainable development to the highest political levels and will ensure that environment sustainability is kept at the forefront of government decision making. </ParaText><ParaText id="1163166">The bill also outlines an important audit and assessment role for the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development largely through consequential amendments to the Auditor General Act, which outlines more broadly the roles and duties of the commissioner. Through these proposed amendments, the commissioner will be required to review a draft of the federal strategy before it is finalized to ensure that the targets and their implementation strategies will be capable of being assessed. The commissioner will also report on the extent to which departments and agencies have contributed to meeting the targets set out in the federal sustainable development strategy and assess the fairness of the information contained in the progress report to be prepared by Environment Canada. Again, these are important steps toward increasing transparency and accountability to all Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163167"> The bill is in keeping with good pieces of work brought forward by the government, all in an effort to improve environmental protection in Canada. This includes initiatives such as the national vehicle scrappage program, introduced by the <Affiliation DbId="105835" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> on June 4, and many other initiatives through the government's comprehensive plan to combat climate change and improve air quality through our government's “Turning the Corner” action plan.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163168">The bill represents an important step in Canada toward living up to both domestic and international calls for the development of an overarching sustainable development strategy.

The bill reflects, to a large degree, the work of the David Suzuki Foundation with input from the Natural Step Canada group. It was developed and amended through extensive consultation with the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163174">The person who has worked harder on this bill than anyone, who has negotiated with all the parties and legislative council and environmental groups, is one of our own parliamentary interns, Delaney Greig, for whom I predict a great future. She was ably assisted by my legislative assistant, Bo Romaguer.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163175">The original reason I chose to put forward Bill <Document DbId="3075383" Type="4">C-474</Document> was a universal dissatisfaction with the existing departmental sustainable development strategies process. The system of departmental reports has received criticism from both Conservative and Liberal ministers of the environment, from former commissioners of the environment and sustainable development and from the green ribbon panel that was established last year to review sustainable development strategies process.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163176">Specifically, there has been broad recognition of the need for greater accountability in the sustainable development strategy process and for a coherent, overarching federal strategy developed at the heart of the government.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163177">These are exactly the changes made under the federal sustainable development bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163178"> Bill <Document DbId="3075383" Type="4">C-474</Document> calls for the development of a federal sustainable development strategy containing goals and targets developed by the <Affiliation DbId="105835" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> with cabinet oversight. The federal strategy will be examined by Parliament, an advisory council and the commissioner prior to its coming into force. A progress review will occur every three years through a report to Parliament and a corresponding assessment report from the commissioner. Further, departmental sustainable development strategies will be required to comply with and contribute to the federal strategy and will also be assessed.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163179">Moving through committee, a number of amendments have been made to Bill <Document DbId="3075383" Type="4">C-474</Document> to eliminate the need for a royal recommendation, as the Speaker has earlier recognized, and to draw in features that reflect the interests of all the parties represented here today.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163180">As the government was contemplating changes to the sustainable development strategy process, it considered the route laid out in Bill <Document DbId="3075383" Type="4">C-474</Document>. Bringing together our thinking and theirs, we have amended Bill <Document DbId="3075383" Type="4">C-474</Document> to satisfy all four parties.

This bill calls for the following: the development and implementation of a national sustainable development strategy; the reporting of progress against a standard set of environmental indicators; and the appointment of an independent commissioner of the environment and sustainable development accountable to Parliament. This bill sets specific goals with respect to sustainable development in Canada and makes consequential amendments to another Act. </ParaText><ParaText id="1163195"> Clearly, the purpose of Bill <Document DbId="3075383" Type="4">C-474</Document>, introduced by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78515" Type="2">Don Valley West</Affiliation>, is to develop a sustainable development strategy based on the precautionary principle and to create a position of commissioner of the environment and sustainable development that would be independent of the Office of the Auditor General. In any case, that was the original idea, to create an independent commissioner position. We will see this later. As the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78515" Type="2">Don Valley West</Affiliation> said earlier, everyone has made some compromises, including the Bloc Québécois. It was not, and is still not, our first choice, far from it, but we agree with the bill on the whole.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163196">The bill also provides for the creation of an advisory council on sustainable development tasked with advising the federal government on the national sustainable development strategy that will be developed.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163197">Although the Bloc Québécois supported Bill <Document DbId="3075383" Type="4">C-474</Document> in principle, it still felt that the bill needed a number of improvements. Indeed, in its first incarnation, the bill had some serious flaws in terms of respect for Quebec's exclusive jurisdiction.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163198">In fact, as originally drafted, the bill enabled the federal government to unilaterally set Canada-wide targets in many areas for which the Government of Quebec has responsibility, including the rate of recycling, use of agricultural land and urban development. These provisions were unacceptable to Quebec, and the Bloc Québécois said as much. The Bloc Québécois always defends the interests of Quebec and the Government of Quebec, so we obviously had to oppose these amendments.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163199">That did not prevent us from supporting the principle of a federal sustainable development strategy. However, from the outset, that strategy should have applied only to areas of federal jurisdiction and the actions of federal institutions. Consequently, as usual, the Bloc Québécois worked constructively to correct the deficiencies in Bill <Document DbId="3075383" Type="4">C-474</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163200">We proposed an approach based on cooperation between the federal government, Quebec and the provinces, whereby all the governments could adjust their policies so as not to interfere with each other. Most importantly, we proposed that the federal government absolutely respect Quebec's jurisdictions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163201">Too often, the federal government interferes in Quebec's jurisdictions. It constantly creates federal initiatives that not only duplicate what Quebec is already doing, but sometimes negate the effectiveness of Quebec's own initiatives. The bill reflected this “Ottawa knows best” attitude.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163202">Fortunately, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78515" Type="2">Don Valley West</Affiliation> had an open mind and very early on adopted a cooperative attitude that led to improvements to the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163203">Still, it would be wrong to say that the bill is perfect. The Bloc Québécois feels that it could have been improved further, especially as regards the actions of the departments.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163204">Specifically, the Bloc Québécois feels that the strategies developed by the various departments should have included a requirement to conduct an environmental assessment of policy, plan and program proposals. Currently, only the cabinet directive on the environmental assessment of policy, plan and program proposals requires that departments conduct such assessments, and this requirement is too often ignored.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163205">Moreover, this was among the findings in the report the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development tabled in March 2008. I had prepared some lengthy quotes, but suffice it to say that the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development confirmed both that there is a lack of political will and that the directive is unevenly applied.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1163206">The Bloc Québécois wished to create a mandatory legal obligation to fix the problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163207">As for the other problems with the bill in its original form, the vast majority of them have been corrected. The bill now applies only to the federal government, its departments and institutions. As well, it is more precise and respectful in its terminology, speaking of aboriginal peoples instead of restricting consultations to first nations alone.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163208">Unfortunately, the bill was gutted in committee: the Commissioner of the Environment, who was supposed to be independent and subject to the same conditions as the Auditor General, who is appointed under the Auditor General Act, will not be. He will remain part of the Auditor General's Office. </ParaText><ParaText id="1163209">The Bloc Québécois is disappointed with this outcome. We argued strongly in favour of the independence of the Commissioner of the Environment, both from the government as well as from the Office of the Auditor General, to which he now reports. </ParaText><ParaText id="1163210">Again, this position is much too important not to be granted the same status as the position of Auditor General. The Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development must be able to carry out audits, conduct reviews and make recommendations objectively, in the same way as the Commissioner of Official Languages, and cannot simply examine the department's financial statements and look at whether it is following procedures. The commissioner must be able to require real action to protect the environment.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163211">The Bloc Québécois supports Bill <Document DbId="3075383" Type="4">C-474</Document>. The federal government must adopt a sustainable development strategy in order to limit its actions and the actions of its departments and agencies. The Bloc Québécois realizes, however, that a lot remains to be done to ensure that the environment is truly respected. This includes making the position of the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development truly independent.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163212"> The national sustainable development strategy must include some standards. It should also include implementation strategies for meeting all of the targets. These include caps on emissions, by sector and region, that are consistent with the targets; economic instruments; and an emission trading system with a declining cap. </ParaText><ParaText id="1163213">The strategy has a number of goals, including the one in clause 5(2)(<I>d</I>), which says, “Canada should become globally renowned for its leadership in conserving, protecting and restoring the natural beauty of the nation and the health and diversity of its ecosystems, parks and wilderness areas.” </ParaText><ParaText id="1163214">The Forest Stewardship Council is an organization that certifies forest management. If I may, I would like to say a few words about how we need to consider whether, in addition to the measures in clauses 8 through 11 of the bill, this national development strategy should call on the government to set an example by using only FSC-certified paper.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163215">As I just said, the FSC is an organization that certifies forest management. FSC certification recognizes that forest owners are managing the resource responsibly. They do not clearcut; they reforest and they respect biodiversity within the forest. Certification shows that FSC members have conducted a detailed evaluation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163216">FSC-certified paper is paper made from fibre from a certified forest. That is the kind of paper we in Parliament, in government, should commit to using, thereby providing a concrete example of sustainable development.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163217">In closing, I would like to congratulate the sponsor of the bill, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78515" Type="2">Don Valley West</Affiliation>, and wish him a happy retirement.

It is great that he is able to leave the House of Commons on this note, where there is all party agreement to support this important piece of legislation. It is a good way to end his career in the House of Commons.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163220">I want to make it clear that New Democrats support this legislation. We supported the decision only minutes ago to ensure that the bill gets to the Senate after the finish of the debate today. It is very important to move this bill forward.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163221">When we talk about sustainable development, I cannot hear that term without thinking of a friend and colleague, a former member of the B.C. legislative assembly, the former member for Burnaby-Willingdon and the former B.C. environment minister, Joan Sawicki. </ParaText><ParaText id="1163222">Joan Sawicki is someone who has a clear vision of sustainable development for Canada. She has worked tirelessly and continually to educate Canadians and political leaders on the importance of inventing the principles of sustainable development and environmental protection in all we do as governments and as a society. I want to thank Joan Sawicki for raising my consciousness on this issue and for helping get this kind of commitment on the political agenda here in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163223">I also want to note that the bill before us today is very similar to Bill <Document DbId="3073347" Type="4">C-437</Document>, which was tabled by my NDP colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78654" Type="2">Burnaby—New Westminster</Affiliation> back on May 1, 2007. It seems that one way or another this legislation was going to be before the House. That shows the importance of it and the dedication from all corners of the House to see this dealt with.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163224">The member for <Affiliation DbId="78654" Type="2">Burnaby—New Westminster</Affiliation> acted quickly on the suggestions of the Suzuki Foundation when they were originally put forward. He also engaged a process of community consultation with the people of Burnaby and New Westminster before tabling his version of the bill. I know that he had looked forward to the opportunity to have that legislation discussed in the House, but as I said, we are pleased that the member for <Affiliation DbId="78515" Type="2">Don Valley West</Affiliation>, who had a higher priority on the private members' list, was able to get it before the House and through the process and before us today.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163225">At the time that my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78654" Type="2">Burnaby—New Westminster</Affiliation> tabled his legislation, which is very similar to this bill, he noted that Canada was 28th of 30 countries in terms of environmental performance and that we were the eighth largest producer of carbon dioxide. That was a record that needed to be addressed. This legislation will go some way to dealing with some of those issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163226">The legislation before us was developed by the Suzuki Foundation as part of its report, “Sustainability within a Generation”. In that report it noted that the countries that are ranked highest in the OECD in terms of progress on environmental issues have sustainable development strategies in place. Canada was one of the countries that did not have such a strategy in place, along with Belgium, Spain and the United States.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163227">Canada has committed to such a strategy at many international forums, including the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, the 1997 Earth Summit+5 in New York, and the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development. Finally, we are debating legislation that would ensure that this issue remains planted firmly on the agenda of our government here in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163228">Sadly, over the years, Canada missed the mark on some of the key best practices with regard to sustainable development, best practices such as comprehensive goals and targets. Canada was often criticized for having fragmented goals across many sectors. On the other hand, Sweden had 16 legislated environmental quality objectives and 71 measurable targets with short, medium and long term timelines. It is a very different way of looking at the idea of comprehensive goals and targets.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163229">Another key best practice is progressive monitoring and reporting. Canada has some monitoring, but it is not linked to targets specifically. There is no benchmarking of Canada's performance relative to that of other countries. The United Kingdom, on the other hand, monitors 68 environmental indicators and assesses them against quantifiable goals. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="00">(1400)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1163230">Another best practice was environmental governance and leadership. Before the legislation came forward, Canada had no single integrated strategy and no overall government leadership and coordination on the environment.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163231">Other countries, like Germany, Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom all have central agencies and high level prime minister's office and cabinet committees that coordinate environmental development and implementation of environmental policy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163232">It is clear that there was lots of room for improvement, lots of room for Canada to catch up with countries to which we often look for ideas, for commitments and to whose standards we hold ourselves, so this legislation is very important in that regard. </ParaText><ParaText id="1163233">In this corner of the House, New Democrats believe that a sustainable development strategy is a complex of important measures. It is like a three-legged stool that needs a number of measures to be successful.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163234"> We believe that a cap and trade system is very important to a sustainable development strategy. We believe that institutional changes to implement cap and trade and to promote and enforce the culture of sustainable development in government is also a key component</ParaText><ParaText id="1163235">We also believe that selective green fiscal measures that would cover specific measures is also very important. That is why we are pleased that today we are dealing with one aspect of that which is a crucial piece of an overall sustainable development strategy and will lead us in the right direction.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163236">It is very clear that we must integrate a commitment to sustainable development into all the work of government. It is hard to believe that anyone who reflects on the current situation of our planet would deny the importance of taking this step. I am glad that there is unanimity here in the House on this issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163237">My colleague for <Affiliation DbId="78654" Type="2">Burnaby—New Westminster</Affiliation> put it this way when he tabled his version of this bill. He said:</ParaText><ParaText id="1163238"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">It is time that sustainable development be a front-running issue for every ministry and become a part of our political culture. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1163239">We believe Bill <Document DbId="3075383" Type="4">C-474</Document> would do just that.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163240">We also believe that Bill <Document DbId="3075383" Type="4">C-474</Document> complements, in a very positive way, Bill <Document DbId="3073285" Type="4">C-377</Document>, the <Document DbId="3073285" Type="4">Climate Change Accountability Act</Document> put forward by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78385" Type="2">Toronto—Danforth</Affiliation> and the leader of the New Democratic Party. </ParaText><ParaText id="1163241">That bill provides scientifically based medium and long term targets for Canada to avoid dangerous levels of climate change. It identifies specifically the necessary steps to avoid the 2° threshold for catastrophic climate change. The destination of 80% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2050 and regular benchmarks are identified in the bill of the member for <Affiliation DbId="78385" Type="2">Toronto—Danforth</Affiliation>, which has passed the House and hopefully will be considered by the Senate in short order.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163242">This bill, we believe, complements that well because it provides a legal framework for preparing and implementing a national sustainable development strategy that aims at integrating through institutional changes, through comprehensive sustainability goals and measurable targets to achieve sustainable development here in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163243">We believe this is a very important measure to be taking to complement other measures already taken by the House and passed here in this place.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163244"> This is a very important achievement of Parliament. I again thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="78515" Type="2">Don Valley West</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="78654" Type="2">Burnaby—New Westminster</Affiliation> who have shown great leadership in taking the work of the Suzuki Foundation and ensuring it reached the floor of the House of Commons. </ParaText><ParaText id="1163245">It is important to note that all parties have ensured the passage of this legislation today. Taking this step toward establishing in law a national sustainable development strategy for Canada is crucial and important and is work that we can all be proud of here today.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="05">(1405)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Galipeau" id="2533408"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="114224" Type="92">The Acting Speaker (Mr. Royal Galipeau)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1163246">Resuming debate.</ParaText><ParaText id="1163247">Pursuant to order adopted earlier today, Motions Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 are deemed adopted, Bill <Document DbId="3075383" Type="4">C-474</Document>, as amended, is deemed concurred in at report stage with further amendments and deemed read a third time and passed.</ParaText><ProceduralText TocType="TCC" id="14">(Motions Nos. 1 to 4 agreed to, bill, as amended, concurred in at report stage with further amendments, read the third time and passed) </ProceduralText><ParaText id="1163248"><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Royal Galipeau):</B> It being 2:07 p.m., this House stands adjourned until next Monday at <?bk?>11 a.m.<?ek?> pursuant to Standing Order <?bk?>24(1).<?ek?></ParaText><ParaText id="1163249">(The House adjourned at 2:07 p.m.)</ParaText></Content></Intervention></SubjectOfBusinessContent></SubjectOfBusiness></OrderOfBusiness></HansardBody><MemberLists><MemberListsLabel>APPENDIX</MemberListsLabel><MemberListsTitle><Line>Alphabetical List of Members with their</Line><Line>Constituencies, Province of Constituency</Line><Line>and Political Affiliations;</Line><Line>Committees of the House,</Line><Line>the Ministry and Parliamentary Secretary</Line></MemberListsTitle><MemberList MemberListType="ChairOccupants"><title>Chair Occupants</title><Affiliation><Role>The Speaker</Role><Name>Hon.
