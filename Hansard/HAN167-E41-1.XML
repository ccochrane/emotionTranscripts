Electronics are ubiquitous in our lives today. Computers, tablets, smart phones and countless other devices help to connect us with each other and participate in the 21st century economy.

They submitted this idea as part of my 2012 Create Your Canada contest. I congratulate them for their initiative and work to help build a better nation. They and young people all across Canada know we must act now to ensure the health and wellbeing of future generations. </ParaText><ParaText id="3012856">I hope all members will join me in supporting this important bill and their wonderful idea.</ParaText>

Therefore, it is about time that we provide the same type of tax breaks to the distillery industry, so that spirits can be manufactured, jobs created and more agriculture products bought from our farmers. Corn, wheat, barley and of course rye are major components of our whisky.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3012863">Therefore, it is important that we provide this tax incentive by reducing it by $1 per litre of alcohol.

Much more needs to be done to bring the military justice system more in line with the civilian justice system. We on this side of the House want a comprehensive bill that adequately addresses the problem. No justice system is perfect, but that should not stop us from trying to improve our system as much as possible.</ParaText><ParaText id="3012903">Many elements have been left out of Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>: reforming the summary trial system, reforming the grievance system and strengthening the Military Police Complaints Commission.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3012904">The fact that the NDP included these three elements in amendments of the previous version of the bill and that those amendments are now absent cannot be a coincidence. As I said, the NDP is not opposed to the spirit of this bill. We want to work with the Conservatives to get it right in order to ensure that the bill is relevant and that it has a broad enough scope.</ParaText><ParaText id="3012905">I do not understand why the government did not include these elements in the bill. They are important in a consistent military justice reform.</ParaText><ParaText id="3012906">Let us look specifically at the grievance system. We must understand it in order to appreciate the importance of the improvements proposed by the NDP.</ParaText><ParaText id="3012907">I would like to quote the directive on military grievances, which is found on the Department of National Defence website. It indicates:</ParaText><ParaText id="3012908"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The DND and the CF shall manage all grievances through the Canadian Forces Grievance System...and ensure that:</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3012909"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentRest="2" IndentFirst="2">all grievances are processed as efficiently and expeditiously as possible;</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3012910"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">a CF member is not penalized for submitting a grievance; and</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3012911"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">assistance is made available to a CF member in the preparation of a grievance.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3012912">The last point is important: the Canadian Forces has the responsibility to help its members because they do not have a union-type association to defend them. This lack of counter-balance is another reason why it is important to ensure that we have an effective and impartial system.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3012913">The NDP proposed two improvements. First, we proposed that at least 60% of grievance board members must be civilians who have never been an officer or a member of the Canadian Forces and, second, that the Chief of Defence Staff be given more authority to resolve the financial aspects of grievances.</ParaText><ParaText id="3012914">The first improvement, namely, that the grievance board strike a balance between military and civilian membership, is important to ensure that this process is perceived as being external and independent. When it comes to the military, perception is very important for Canadians. Everyone in the country should be able to see that the system is independent and fair. Members of the military have a great deal of experience in managing such situations, so it is rather important that they are truly involved in the process. However, the presence of civilians is also important to dispel the idea that members of the military are subject to a different kind of justice than ordinary Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3012915">I would like to once again quote a Canadian Forces document. This time, I will be quoting an excerpt from chapter 34 of the “Military Administrative Law Manual” to demonstrate how this process, which may generally seem strange to Canadians, works. Point no. 24 of the section on the CF grievance board states:</ParaText>

The NDP believes that a significant civilian presence on this board would help maintain this perception. When we look at how to strengthen the Military Police Complaints Commission, the merits of this idea and our position are quite obvious.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3012926">Police officers, as agents of social control, have a key role to play in our society, which is based on the rule of law. They are effective not only because they have the manpower and equipment, of course, but also because of their perceived legitimacy by the public. The military police is no exception. For a police force to operate properly, whether it is military or civilian, it must have the approval of those under its authority. A police force gains legitimacy through its perceived integrity. This perception is built on the actions of the police force and the perception of fairness and justice in its operations.</ParaText><ParaText id="3012927">There is no better way to prove the integrity of a police force than by having a strong monitoring body. A Military Police Complaints Commission that is legitimate and reports to Parliament is the best way to ensure fairness in the actions of military police and, just as importantly, the perception of fairness and justice by Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3012928">The second improvement is that the Chief of Defence Staff should have more authority to resolve financial aspects related to grievances. This is a simple requirement to ensure that the grievance system is consistent. If the Chief of Defence Staff does not have the ability to resolve financial aspects, it calls into question the relevance of the grievance process. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3012929">I should point out that Canada is not the only country to be reviewing its military justice system. Australia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Ireland have recently done the same. We are in an excellent position to pass a comprehensive and effective bill while taking into account what has been done in other countries. Unfortunately, that is not the case with the bill as it stands. As I already said, the NDP proposed amendments to the bill in its previous form. But those amendments are no longer part of the current bill. We would like to see something constructive if and when the bill goes to committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="3012930">In conclusion, although I focused mainly on the grievance system, it is important to note that this is just one thing missing from this bill. The NDP will continue to work to include the essential measures that it had passed in the former version of this bill. There is no reason for the Conservatives not to admit the relevance of these measures. Their hiding of this fact reeks of partisanship.</ParaText>

This whole process is supposed to be a result of the 80 recommendations brought forward by the Lamer report. The government cherry-picked them down to 28.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3012950">This bill is also a follow-up to <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">Bill C-41</Document>, from the previous Parliament.

Yet the government, in the present Parliament, has taken those amendments passed by a parliamentary committee and thrown them out the window.</ParaText><ParaText id="3012951">That is highly problematic. If we look at some of the amendments the government walked away from, they had to do with the authority of the Chief of the Defence Staff in the grievance process, which was amended under clause 6 in <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">Bill C-41</Document>, responding directly to Justice Lamer's recommendation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3012952">There is also the issue of changes in the composition of the grievance committee to include 60% civilian membership, which was amended in clause 11 in <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">Bill C-41</Document>.

							<ParaText id="3012953">What we are talking about is basic justice and basic fairness for those who put themselves in harm's way.</ParaText><ParaText id="3012954">The 80 recommendations from the Lamer report remind me of the 80 recommendations that came down after the Kashechewan prison fire, where Ricardo Wesley and Jamie Goodwin burned to death in a makeshift police cell in 2006, in a federal facility, under Nishnawbe-Aski police.</ParaText><ParaText id="3012955">I was at the funeral for those young men. There was trauma within the community and within the police force among the men and women who were hired to represent Canada and protect communities in the far north. The Nishnawbe-Aski police, like the military, sometimes face extreme circumstances. All they ask for is fairness.</ParaText><ParaText id="3012956">Unfortunately, what I see in the far north in our policing services, which are funded 52% by the federal government and 48% by the provincial government, is that they are often facing combat conditions and third-world conditions. </ParaText><ParaText id="3012957">In Kashechewan, one of our police officers had to live in a tent. The jail cells did not have a basic water sprinkler system. On any given day we have maybe 30 officers out of 150 off on stress leave. We have suicides. We have an incidence of post-traumatic stress among our front-line officers at the level of combat casualties.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3012958">These are officers who dedicate themselves to ensuring the health and safety of communities. </ParaText><ParaText id="3012959">The government ignored almost all of the recommendations in that report, in the same way that they are ignoring the Lamer report.</ParaText><ParaText id="3012960"> I think that is unfortunate, because once again, it is about our obligation as legislators. The most serious job we do in this House is make a decision on whether to put someone's life on the line, whether we send them into combat or on peacekeeping missions or whether we send them to represent justice and the protection of civilian life in the far north.</ParaText><ParaText id="3012961">When those officers, those men and women, find themselves in trouble, they should have a system in place that ensures a level of fairness. I was thinking about the various opinions we have heard on this bill . Once again, people want to see the military justice system improve, but they are concerned that the government is clearly walking away from key provisions that will ensure fairness and the right to due process.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3012962">Colonel Michel Drapeau, military law expert, said that the issue of summary trials must be addressed, because “[t]here is currently nothing more important for Parliament to focus on than fixing a broken system that affects the legal rights of a significant number of Canadian citizens every year”. He continued that “I find it very odd that those who put their lives at risk to protect the rights of Canadians are themselves deprived of those charter rights when facing a summary trial. If Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland have seen fit to change the summary trial system, it begs the question: why is Canada lagging behind?” </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3012963">Why indeed? As I was preparing for the discussion this morning, I was thinking about the situation of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board, and Harold Leduc, who was drummed out of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board for making waves. The waves he was making were in defence of the needs of soldiers who are coming before the appeals board. He was ruffling feathers within the bureaucracy and the government. The story of his being drummed out as a representative of the armed forces is very disturbing, because we are talking about allegations of harassment and corruption at the board. Mr. Leduc was targeted. His privacy was violated. The issue of post-traumatic stress was used against him, which he took to the Human Rights Commission. He won. It found that he was facing harassment for speaking up for the men and women who put their lives on the line and are only asking for fairness.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3012964">When the government decided to remove Mr. Leduc from the Veterans Review and Appeal Board, he said that he was not surprised. He said, “To me, it speaks to the overall corruption I've witnessed”. </ParaText><ParaText id="3012965">That is a pretty disturbing allegation against the board whose job is protecting the needs of those who serve. Just as we see in the far north with the Nishnawbe-Aski police, who have a right to ensure that if they put themselves at risk or they get injured or have post-traumatic stress there will be services for them, so too should the soldiers who come back from Afghanistan or from other duties have a right to the Veterans Review and Appeal Board. Yet we see the government shutting down the veterans' spokesmen, the people who are defending those in need. </ParaText><ParaText id="3012966">We see the same system in the criminal justice system the soldiers face, where they do not have proper counsel or civilian intervention. They have to go sometimes before what essentially could be seen as an old boys' club. This is not fair. The need to reform this has been spoken about. Yet the government has once again decided, for whatever purpose or whatever reason, to ignore the key recommendations on transformation, key recommendations that would actually ensure some fairness. It will go with this bill that is quite simply insufficient for the purposes at hand.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3012967">We want to work on reforming military justice in this country. We will not be supporting a bill that so clearly ignores the key recommendations.</ParaText><ParaText id="3012968"> The issue of summary trials is key. </ParaText><ParaText id="3012969">There is the issue of having civilian involvement in the review process. The Lamer report talked of the need for 60%. There is a need for the grievance committee to have an external review process. It is presently staffed by retired officers, some only recently retired. If the Canadian Forces Grievance Board is to be perceived as an external and independent oversight civilian body, as it was destined to be, then the appointments process needs to reflect that reality. Once again, we are saying that it cannot be just internal. It has to have outside voices so that we do not see the same kind of harassment of veterans as at the Veterans Review and Appeal Board, with the shutting down of the people who are actually there to stand up and speak for veterans. We need to have some sort of system of external fairness.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3012970">Sometimes when soldiers are charged, they could face having a criminal record for something that in civilian court would be considered minor. If they leave the army with a criminal record, it would affect them for the rest of their lives.</ParaText><ParaText id="3012971"> Once again, those who are serving our country should be entitled to due process. That is a fundamental principle. We have seen reform happen in England and Ireland. The question is why the government is ignoring key recommendations of the Lamer report. Why is it not working with us to ensure that we have a system that ensures fairness for those men and women who put themselves at risk for our country?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We have some serious concerns with this legislation and will be opposing it at second reading. Committee stage has not been all that fruitful over the last year and a half of the majority Conservative government, but I suppose that if we did get some amendments that brought the legislation back to the state it was in the previous parliament, then we could get onside with that. Here we are debating this legislation in the House of Commons, recognizing that committees have not been doing their due diligence on many of the bills that have gone forward. The government has been using its majority in committees to block many useful amendments. That problem, we all recognize, has been changing our ability to provide good legislation for Canadians.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3012989">I want to talk about the summary trial system and the fact that a conviction of a service offence in a summary trial of a Canadian Forces member may result in a criminal record. I am concerned about the vast number of Canadians who may end up with a criminal record for offences that are relatively minor and the fact that we do this at a higher rate than many other civilized countries in the world.</ParaText><ParaText id="3012990">We have a system that puts a criminal record on the backs of Canadians for a variety of offences, including in some cases for very minor and victimless offences that really do not warrant the kind of long-term impediment to a convicted person's lifestyle that a criminal conviction entails. That impediment includes getting a job, getting a place to live or travelling to other countries. Having a criminal record in Canada seriously impedes the progress of someone's life, and we here in Parliament should take it seriously. A conviction becomes part of a citizen's history and affects his or her life going forward. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3012991">Now we have summary trials in the military tradition. The NDP worked hard on the previous bill to get an amendment that would strike off a great number of the offences under the National Defence Act that can result in criminal records. In the previous bill the government was going to remove five of those offences but we managed to get that number up to 27. I am not familiar with precisely which five offences still remain in this legislation. </ParaText><ParaText id="3012992">When I look at the offences under the National Defence Act, such as disobedience of a lawful command, for instance, should that carry forward in every instance in a summary trial? Remember that we are talking about a summary trial where there is no obligation on the part of those conducting the trial to provide legal counsel to the people standing in front of them. We are dealing with a hierarchical system where the complainant in the military tradition has the upper hand over the defendant.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3012993">Providing prompt but fair justice in respect to minor service offences contributes to the maintenance of military discipline and efficiency. However, given that our military personnel are under great stress and have to deal with being away from home for long periods of time under a very strict command and control structure, they are likely to offend in some way if, under the command system, they are identified as a problem. That is the nature of military service.</ParaText><ParaText id="3012994">We have to think about what we are doing with or creating for these people when they come out of the military into the general population. That is very important. It is a very serious situation for them if, from a summary trial, they have a criminal record for some minor service infraction. I think this goes on quite often In Canada. We give people a criminal record for a variety of small offences in the military, which I do not think is appropriate to do there or in the general justice system. We need to reform all of our justice systems so that we not too easily burden people with a criminal record designation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3012995">Under the National Defence Act we have offences such as abuse of subordinates, connivance at desertion, absence without leave, cruel or disgraceful conduct, insubordinate behaviour, quarrels and disturbances. These are all part of life. They are things that happen to one degree or another. How is something like a quarrel or disturbance designated? I hate to think that by quarrelling with the government here over the bill that I could be up on a summary offence by some trial in the House of Commons. However, that is what happens in the military.</ParaText><ParaText id="3012996">We must maintain military discipline and there are reasons to have summary trials, but the sentencing that goes along with that is what we are talking about here. That is at question. Should minor offences have a long-lasting impact on a person's life? This is why the NDP is taking a strong position here, because we do not want to see this happen. We did have good results in the last Parliament in getting 27 of these offences removed, and I think that would make the bill more palatable.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3012997">It is not every day that we discuss the nature of military justice. This is our last shot at it. Once the bill has gone through the process, it may not come before Parliament for another decade. There may be many instances where people end up with criminal records for relatively minor offences over the next decade, if the bill passes during the course of this session. </ParaText><ParaText id="3012998">We have important work to do here and want to see this done right. We want to ensure that the kinds of penalties given for offences in this regard are well thought out and are not punishing Canadians unduly for things that may occur under the conditions of military service. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> amends the National Defence Act to strengthen and alter military justice following the 2003 report of the former chief justice of the Supreme Court, the right hon.

The bill would clarify the responsibilities of the Canadian Forces provost marshal and, finally, it would make amendments to the delegation of the Chief of Defence Staff powers as the final authority in the grievance process.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013016">New Democrats believe that Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> is a step in the right direction to bring the military justice system more in line with the civilian justice system. However, it falls short on key issues when it comes to reforming a number of required aspects of the military justice system, including the summary trial system, the grievance system and the Military Police Complaints Commission.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013017">I will provide some background. In 2003, the right hon. Antonio Lamer, former chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, presented his report to the independent review of the National Defence Act. The Lamer report contained 88 recommendations pertaining to military justice, the Military Police Complaints Commission, the grievance process and the provost marshal. Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> is the legislative response to these recommendations, but thus far only 28 of those recommendations have been implemented in legislation, regulations or via changes in practice. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013018">This bill has appeared in earlier forms. First, Bills <Document DbId="2164205" Type="3">C-7</Document> and <Document DbId="3314337" Type="3">C-45</Document> died on the order paper due to prorogation by the Conservative government in 2007 and an election in 2008. In July 2008, Bill <Document DbId="3546541" Type="3">C-60</Document> came into force simplifying the structure of the court martial system and establishing a method, which was more closely aligned with the civilian system, for choosing the type of court martial. In 2009, the Senate committee consider Bill <Document DbId="3546541" Type="3">C-60</Document> and provided nine recommendations for amendments to the National Defence Act. In 2010, Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document> was introduced to respond to the 2003 Lamer report and the Senate committee report. It outlined provisions related to military justice, such as sentencing reform, military judges and committees, summary trials, court martial panels, the provost marshal and limited provisions related to the grievance process and the Military Police Complaints Commission. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013019">In essence, Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> is similar to the version of Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document> that came out of committee in the previous Parliament. There are a number of amendments that carry over, which include the court martial composition, military judges' security of tenure and provisions relating to the appointment process and the age of judges. However, other important amendments that passed at committee stage at the end of the last parliamentary session are not included in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>. These include the following, which were also presented by the New Democrats as amendments to that piece of legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013020">What is missing from this bill is the authority of the Chief of Defence Staff in the grievance process, which responds directly to Justice Lamer's recommendation; changes to the composition of the grievance committee to include a 60% civilian membership; and finally, a provision to ensure that a person who is convicted of an offence during the summary trial is not unfairly subjected to a criminal record. It is this last point that causes particular concern to all Canadians who care about the justice system in this country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013021">There are many important reforms in this bill and the NDP supports the long overdue update to the military justice system. Members of the Canadian Forces are held to an extremely high standard of discipline and they, in turn, deserve a judicial system that is held to a comparable standard. The NDP will be opposing this bill at second reading. However, there are shortcomings in this bill that we hope can be addressed at the committee stage if, in fact, it gets that far. Here are some of the amendments that we hope to see passed. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="05">(1105)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3013022">The amendments in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> do not adequately address the unfairness of summary trials. Currently, a conviction of a service offence from a summary trial in the Canadian Forces may result in a criminal record. Summary trials, though, are held without the ability of the accused to consult counsel. There are no appeals or transcripts of the so-called trial, and the judge is the accused person's commanding officer. This causes undue harshness on certain members of the Canadian Forces who can be, and are, convicted of very minor service offences, offences that would not otherwise be criminal offences.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013023">For example, some of these minor service offences include insubordination, quarrels, disturbances, absence without leave, drunkenness and disobeying a lawful command. These could be matters that are extremely important to military discipline, but they are not necessarily worthy of a criminal record. Certainly drunkenness is not a criminal offence, and many members of the House would probably attest to that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013024">Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> also makes an exemption for a select number of offences if they carry a minor punishment, which is defined in the act, or a fine less than $500 to no longer result in a criminal record. This is one of the positive aspects of the bill but it does not, in our opinion, go far enough.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013025">At committee stage last March, the NDP amendments to Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document> were carried to expand this list of offences that could be considered minor and not necessarily worthy of a criminal record. We would increase that number from five specified offences to 27, if the offence in question received a minor punishment.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013026">The amendment also extended the list of punishments that may be imposed by a tribunal without an offender incurring a criminal record, such as a severe reprimand, a reprimand on its own, a fine equal up to one month's basic pay or another minor punishment.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013027">This was a major step forward for summary trials. However, this amendment was not retained in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>, and we want to see it included here.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013028">We also believe it is important to reform the grievance system because at present the grievance committee does not provide a means of external review. Currently it is staffed entirely of retired Canadian Forces officers, some only relatively recently retired. If the Canadian Forces Grievance Board is to be perceived as an external and independent oversight civilian body, as it was designed to be, then the appointment process needs to be amended to reflect that reality. Thus, some members of the board should be drawn from civil society.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013029">The NDP amendment provides that at least 60% of the grievance committee members must never have been an officer or a non-commissioned member of the Canadian Forces. Again, this amendment was passed in March 2011 in Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document> but was not retained in the bill before the House. We think it is important to see that amendment retained in the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013030">Finally, the NDP believes we must strengthen the Military Police Complaints Commission. The bill amends the National Defence Act to establish a timeline within which the Canadian Forces provost marshal would be required to resolve conduct complaints as well as to protect complainants from being penalized for submitting a complaint in good faith. Although a step forward, the NDP believes that more needs to be done to empower this commission.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013031">Care has not been taken to provide the Military Police Complaints Commission with the required legislative provisions empowering it to act as an oversight body. This commission must be empowered by a legislative provision that will allow it to rightfully investigate and report to Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013032">Let us talk about what some independent people have said about the bill. I want to quote Colonel Michel Drapeau, a retired colonel from the Canadian Forces and a military law expert. Here is what he said in February 2011:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013033"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">I strongly believe that the summary trial issue must be addressed.... There is currently nothing more important for Parliament to focus on than fixing a system that affects the legal rights of a significant number of Canadian citizens every year. Why? Because unless and until you, the legislators, address this issue, it is almost impossible for the court to address any challenge, since no appeal of a summary trial verdict or sentence is permitted. As well, it is almost impossible for any other form of legal challenge to take place, since there are no trial transcripts and no right to counsel at summary trial.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3013034">Colonel Drapeau also said:</ParaText><ParaText id="3013035"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">—I find it very odd that those who put their lives at risk to protect the rights of Canadians are themselves deprived of some of those charter rights when facing a summary trial. If Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland have seen fit to change the summary trial system, it begs the question: why is Canada lagging behind?</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013036">I believe all members of the House want to see members of the Canadian Forces guaranteed the very charter rights that we send them into harm's way to fight for on our behalf. One part of those rights is that when people face potential criminal sanctions, they have a right to counsel. They have a right to a judge that is independent. They have a right to transcripts and a meaningful right to appeal. Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> does not allow this and I urge all members of the House to work on this bill to address those serious problems.</ParaText>

It is a serious problem. The amendments in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> do not deal adequately with the injustice of summary trials. There is a true injustice in these trials. At present, a guilty verdict from a summary trial in the Canadian Forces results in a criminal record. Summary trials can cover many things, some of them insignificant.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3013067"> They may apply not only to such serious charges as insubordination, but also to less serious offences such as drunkenness or the like, which have nothing to do with the criminal offences that would be found on a criminal record. This is a serious problem that must be reformed, and it must be done immediately.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013068"> For example, summary trials are held without the accused being able to consult counsel. There is no recourse and no transcript. We can imagine how a trial is conducted when there is no transcript of what was said. The name says it all: “summary trial”. It is summary, with no real justice and no recourse to a real, fair justice system. Summary trials are held for minor and major reasons, and there is no logic to them.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013069"> Moreover, the accused person’s commanding officer acts as the judge. That is much too harsh for some members of the Canadian Forces who are convicted of minor infractions. The fact that the commanding officer is also the judge raises questions about the impartiality of the process. Therefore, changes are needed.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013070">These minor offences include insubordination, as I said, but also quarrels. “Quarrel” is a pretty big word to describe someone raising their voice to someone else. We have to look at the definition of “quarrel”. We are not talking about striking and injuring someone here. Accordingly, we do not see why this should result in a criminal record. Misconduct, again, is very broad. As I said, it is the commanding officer who decides all of this.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013071">Absence without leave, drunkenness and disobeying a command are all undoubtedly very important for military discipline, I agree, but they do not deserve a criminal record, particularly since these soldiers have lives after their military service. Someone who quarrelled with one of his colleagues and who returns to civilian life could find himself with a criminal record because of this.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013072">It then becomes difficult to find a job, to travel outside Canada and to find housing. This creates a whole host of problems for people who, let us not forget, serve the Canadian public and defend our rights and freedoms. Because of some of these measures, their own rights and freedoms are being trampled on somewhat by this military justice system. This process needs to be revised.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013073"> I could touch on many other aspects that need to be revised, but I will not have time. A lot of competent people have looked into this. Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> does not properly reform the military justice system.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013074">To conclude, we in the NDP believe the Canadian Forces already have to meet extremely high standards when it comes to discipline. We know the strict discipline this job calls for. Members of the military are entitled, in return, to a judicial system that is required to meet comparable standards. A criminal record can make life after the military very difficult. Criminal records complicate the process of finding a job, renting an apartment or travelling.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013075"> Accordingly, the NDP will fight to make the Canadian military justice system fairer for the men and women in uniform who have risked their lives in the service of Canada. For that reason, it is very important that this act be revised, to respect and honour our soldiers.</ParaText>

Indeed, summary trials are problematic. I hope that everyone in the House recognizes how important it is that our troops be able to have another life after serving in the military. We need to help them transition to civilian life. Serving Canadians and protecting their rights and freedoms is not an easy job. Military personnel have to make major sacrifices and submit to a very strict discipline. Therefore, it is only natural for us to make their lives easier, as a way to thank them for their services. A person should not have a criminal record because of something that is not a crime. That is why Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> is inadequate and needs improvement, as I pointed out during my speech.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Nantel" id="7733175"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170168" Type="2">Mr. Pierre Nantel (Longueuil—Pierre-Boucher, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3013084">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak in this House on the subject of Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>. We have before us a bill that is a recognition of a serious problem in the administration of military justice. In this regard, we are unfortunately lagging behind many other countries that have identified the same problems as we have, but have made faster and more effective efforts to fix them.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013085">What is strange is that while our Conservative friends acknowledge the problem, they have deliberately chosen to fix only half of it. And that is why we have a problem; that is why we oppose this bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013086">My colleague has talked about the first problem: summary trials that are held in circumstances that do not allow for the accused to make a fair defence. Summary trials are really the nub of the problem. The vast majority of offences committed by members of the military are dealt with by summary trial. One of the statistics we have here seems frightening to me: in 2008-09, a total of 1,865 cases—96% of all cases—were disposed of by summary trial. Obviously it is a euphemism to say “seems”, because 96% says it all.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013087"> What this system means is that the accused does not enjoy rights that are otherwise considered to be fundamental in an ordinary justice system: the right to be represented by counsel; the right to appeal; a transcript of the trial so the person can appeal based on the trial; and the right to an impartial judge. As it stands, the person’s commanding officer is the judge. That situation is clearly unfavourable.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013088"> What if there was judicial error? What if the decision was tainted by personal tensions between the accused and the judge, for example, who happens to be the person’s immediate superior? Anyone who works in an ordinary situation will agree that these are certainly not ideal circumstances for making an objective decision. There is no organization in which such a structure exists without the opportunity to have the decision reviewed.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013089"> The expression “criminal record” is probably the one that most clearly expresses something that can harm and weight down a person’s life. The circumstances in which that record is created are therefore a matter of concern for us. It is in fact a very good thing that we are trying to address this issue. Once again, we are expressing this kind of confidence in our parliamentary system so that we can find concrete solutions for people having to deal with this problem.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013090"> When we consider the consequences of having a criminal record, we can say that the decisions of these tribunals in fact have very serious consequences. These are decisions that harm a person’s entire life. In the first place, having a criminal record will certainly harm the person’s entire existence, jeopardizing all his opportunities to gain access to certain positions, certain jobs, certain countries and so on.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013091"> Imagine you are enrolled in the army and are told to go and fight for your country, for noble values and so that young girls can go fly kites. You are given a weapon, sent into mine fields and left to live in misery, sadness, loss and anger. After all those tribulations and the incredible stresses to which you are exposed, you are given a criminal record for a breach, a breach of discipline, a breach of some barracks code of conduct, for example. That is not even a serious crime, an abuse of power or a violent act, but rather an act of disobedience or insubordination, or merely the result of one pint too many. And you are unable to defend yourself adequately at your summary trial. Imagine that later on, years later, you travel to the United States for a one-week vacation and are turned back. You are in the car with your daughter, and the customs officer says you cannot enter the country because you have a criminal record. One can see the heresy in that situation, when someone who has served his country clearly suffers an injustice.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013092"> In the spring of 2011, the NDP proposed many amendments in committee, one of which in particular comes to mind. We proposed that there be 27 minor penalties, that is to say penalties not resulting in a criminal record. There are currently only five. That is definitely a step forward that should be looked at more closely, since this is clearly a form of injustice. This seems obvious to a novice, since I do not claim to be a legal expert.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013093"> These exceptions must absolutely be brought back to the table in order to put a stop to the injustice of giving military members criminal records for inconsequential offences.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3013094"> Now I would like to talk about respect for the standing committee and its work. It is surprising that the majority in this House did not want to adopt the amendments we introduced last spring. These are not partisan proposals. Instead they are an appeal to common sense and show respect for our military members. This is even a matter of respect for the standing committee’s work. The committee worked long and hard, as many of my colleagues can attest. We can also attest to the enormous amount of work that is done in the committees and that generally appears to remain a dead letter.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013095"> This committee heard evidence and thoughts, recorded appearances and heard many speeches. What about the result of its work? Is it merely good for the shredder? One would think so.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013096"> Ultimately, the committee thought it was good and wise, when Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document> was introduced in spring 2011, to adopt the proposal made by the members of my party, who felt that special attention should be given to cases in which an offence does not deserve a criminal record. Why not respect the committee's work and restore that proposal, which was made in good faith and in a non-partisan manner?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013097"> I would also like to note the importance of the Military Police Complaints Commission and of enhancing its work capacity, which is absolutely necessary. Limited by the fact that it cannot examine cases that arose before 1999, the commission is designed to handle those in which doubts are raised about the military police's work. I have seen cases in which the commission appeared to be powerless in difficult situations where lives were at stake; I hope to have the time to discuss them. For the good of military personnel and the credibility of the military police, it is essential that the commission be able to operate efficiently in a manner respectful of the players who constitute it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013098"> Lastly, we believe that, to be relevant, the grievance committee that examines the rights of military personnel respecting their benefits, their release, internal issues, harassment and medical matters must be independent and stand outside the Canadian Forces. We have previously suggested, for what I believe are obvious reasons, that 60% of the committee members should be individuals who have never served in the Canadian Forces. This is a reasonable proposal that, like everything we are discussing here, is a matter of natural justice and of aligning military justice with civilian justice.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013099"> The members of the Canadian Forces obviously have no association or union to which they can turn. That is why we want the committee to receive and hear the grievances of Canadian Forces members in the rigorous, impartial manner characteristic of an independent outside agency.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013100"> This is a matter of natural justice. No one can dispense justice on his or her own behalf. I am going to act like an intellectual and translate that sentence into Latin: <I>Nemo iudex in causa sua</I>. I have quite a Latin accent; I am trying to entertain my colleagues.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013101"> Everyone has a right to be heard, and that includes the opportunity to appeal a disputed decision or apply for a review of a decision that appears to be incorrect. As that first rule was very popular, I am going to add a second: <I>Audi alteram partem</I>. This is a reference to our basic system and to the Latin language. These are rules of natural justice commonly in effect in civilian law courts in Canada. They are also in effect in military courts in many countries such as Great Britain—which, it must be acknowledged, the government likes so much—New Zealand, Australia and Ireland.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013102"> Why do these rules and rights not apply in our own military courts? Are we saying, “Join the army, sign here, and lose all your rights”? That is a good question.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013103"> What I find most disturbing is the extent to which these people devote their lives to defending their country. It seems almost old-fashioned to say it, but they have to be effective, not drag their feet and solve a problem. They are doing it for us. Honestly, as a parliamentarian, I am embarrassed that it has taken so long to move forward on this issue; we are dragging our feet. I hope we can show some collegiality and resolve these matters as soon as possible so that our men and women in uniform feel they are being heard by civilian society.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The NDP believes that this bill is a step in the right direction in order to make the military justice system and the civilian justice system more uniform. Still, it does not address the key issues needed to reform the summary trial system and the grievance system. Today I will speak to the grievance system.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013121">Significant amendments were made at the committee stage at the end of the last session of Parliament, but have not been included in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>. These include the NDP’s amendments concerning the authority of the Chief of Defence Staff in the grievance process, changes in the composition of the grievance board, and the provision that a person found guilty of an offence through a summary trial would not be unjustly burdened with a criminal record.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013122">I want to say something about the last point. This bill proposes many important reforms. The NDP has long advocated the updating of the military justice system. Members of the Canadian Forces are subject to very high standards of discipline and, as Canadian citizens, they deserve a justice system that is subject to the same standards as those that apply to other Canadian citizens.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013123"> With regard to reforming the summary trial system, the amendments in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> do not properly address the unfairness of summary trials. At present, a conviction at a summary trial in the Canadian Forces results in a criminal record. The accused is not able to consult counsel. There is no appeal and no trial transcript. In addition, the judge is the accused's commanding officer. That is unduly harsh for some members of the Canadian Forces who are convicted for minor offences.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013124">Among those minor offences are insubordination, quarrels and disturbances, misconduct, absence without leave, drunkenness and disobeying a lawful command. They are very important for military discipline, but not worth a criminal record.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013125">Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> provides an exemption so that some offences—with minor punishments or fines under $500—would not be put on a criminal record. This is one of the bill’s positive aspects. But we do not think it goes far enough.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013126"> In committee, in March 2012, the NDP proposed amendments to Bill <Document DbId="5634792" Type="3">C-41</Document> that would have expanded the list of offences that could be considered minor and thus would not attract a criminal record if the offence in question received a minor punishment. The amendment also would have expanded the list of penalties that could be set by a tribunal without being noted in the criminal record.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013127">That was progress in terms of summary trials, but since that amendment was not included in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>, we want it to be included now. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013128"> I want to mention Colonel Drapeau, a retired Canadian Forces colonel and an expert in military law.

One place where this is obvious is in the area of foreign policy, but we also see it in legislation. Just this week, we have again been presented with a mammoth bill that covers pretty much everything but the kitchen sink. And yet on a subject as important as military justice and the rights of the men and women who defend our country, the Conservatives have brought forth a mouse. I think there is room, somewhere between the mammoth and the mouse, for legislation that is a little more worthwhile.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013159"> In 2003, as we know, Justice Lamer submitted his report on the independent review of the National Defence Act. He made 88 recommendations relating to military justice, the Complaints Commission, the grievance procedure and the Canadian Forces provost marshal. We are talking about 88 recommendations. And here we are with a bill that covers only 28 of those recommendations. Once again, this is the approach the Conservatives always take: to pick and choose only the things and the testimony that suit them. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013160"> A lot of things are missing in this bill and I will not address them all, since that would take too long. However, I am going to focus on one aspect in particular where the bill does not go far enough: summary trials and the mark they leave on the lives of soldiers, in the form of a criminal record, even after they return to civilian life. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013161"> We know that a summary trial can be debatable. It is a judgment dealing with matters that can be as trivial as a quarrel or absence without leave. It may relate to misconduct, insubordination, and so on. But the point is this: someone can be convicted of a relatively minor offence and end up with a criminal record for the rest of their life. This is particularly troubling when the accused in a summary trial cannot be represented by counsel and cannot appeal. There is no transcript and the judge is too often, and very often, the accused’s commanding officer. In other words, the people who defend our rights and freedoms are not entitled to the protections under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms at summary trials. If this were merely a question of internal military discipline, we could always debate it, but the problem is that summary trials leave indelible marks on people’s lives in the form of criminal records. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013162">We recognize that the bill makes a vague attempt to remedy the situation. However, it really does not go far enough. It proposes that five offences be considered minor and not result in a criminal record. That is all well and good for the offences in question—and I will not continue to harp on it—but much more could be done. In fact, Bill <Document DbId="5634792" Type="3">C-41</Document>, Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>'s predecessor in the last Parliament, was debated in committee and amended to expand the list of offences and the types of sentences that would not result in a criminal record. I do not know why the Conservatives did not keep this amendment.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013163">What we want is to expand the list of offences from 5 to 27, and the committee already agreed to this. It is so important.

As Colonel Drapeau went on to say, “From where I stand, I find it very odd that those who put their lives at risk to protect the rights of Canadians are themselves deprived of some of those charter rights when facing a summary trial.” </ParaText><ParaText id="3013167">Why should the consequences of relatively minor offences related to military discipline extend into the civilian lives of our men and women in uniform?

I am no expert when it comes to this issue. However, since I now have the opportunity to discuss it, I did my research. I tried to look at what other Parliaments have done. It became clear to me, when reading the 2003 Lamer report, that reform is necessary. Anyone who has studied the recommendations therein can see that a lot of work was done and that much progress was made in the context of the previous Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document>. It is apparent now, however, when considering Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>, that a lot of work was unfortunately done for nought. There is no other way of putting it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013186">I will speak about this work and the reason why a lot of it has gone by the wayside. To begin with, one of the best opportunities for a member of Parliament to speak about a bill or an issue is to take part in the work of committees. It gives us an opportunity to discuss issues with witnesses, who are often experts in their respective subject areas. At the end of the day, we cannot be experts in everything. Asking witnesses questions and listening to their testimony is an extremely important exercise in our legislative and democratic process. We also have the opportunity to carry out clause-by-clause consideration of different bills and to propose amendments.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013187">Clearly, the party in power enjoys a majority in the House. When there was a minority government, however, the work of committees held more sway. That is certainly what we are increasingly witnessing today as we see the government attempt to take away committees’ power. But that is another debate for another day.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013188">Having said that, several amendments were proposed at the time—in February 2011, unless I am mistaken—at the Standing Committee on National Defence. These amendments were passed by all parties. It must be understood that committees represent all elected representatives and parties. The committee, therefore, made amendments that were in line with the most important recommendations in the Lamer report. This was done in an effort to reform the military justice system.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013189">Some of the amendments to Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>, which is before us today, have been scrapped and others retained. I am asking myself the same question that I just asked of my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170187" Type="2">Laurier-Sainte-Marie</Affiliation>. Unfortunately, given the dearth of speakers on the government side, I will not have an opportunity to ask the government this question. I nevertheless wonder why—after being proposed democratically in committee, where the bulk of the work in our parliament was done on this—certain amendments to the bill were retained and others scrapped.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013190">After a bill legally dies on the order paper, there is no obligation to keep the previously adopted amendments when the same bill is presented in another form. Nevertheless, as a democratic and moral principle, and as matter of principle in general, one wonders why the government did not decide to keep these amendments in place, especially since they were not of a partisan nature, and were in line with the ideas put forward in the recommendations of the 2003 Lamer report.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013191">Allow me to speak to a number of these recommendations. After all, the amendments that were not included in the bill in its current form are, unfortunately, reason enough for the NDP to oppose this bill. One of the most important questions concerns summary trials. All citizens of law-based societies such as ours want a balanced system of justice that affords citizens protection.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3013192">That said, it is important to understand that the system that exists within the military is not exactly the same. That is precisely why the necessary reforms are meant to bring the military justice system more in line with the civilian justice system. We want to bring these systems more in line with one another to ensure that the members of our armed forces enjoy adequate legal protection, since they deserve our utmost respect, for reasons that I do not need to repeat here. We know the importance of the sacrifices they make. They do incredible work for our society. It is important that they have adequate legal protection.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013193">When we look at summary trials, one particular aspect is extremely problematic. A number of my colleagues have talked about this aspect, the fact that people can be saddled with a criminal record for violating military regulations. In normal proceedings, such behaviour, while certainly unacceptable, would not be sufficient reason to burden someone with a criminal record. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013194">It is important to maintain discipline within the armed forces. We understand that it is important for commanders who make the decisions in these cases to maintain discipline. We are not saying that any of the regulations themselves should change. The penalties must be strict enough to ensure that offenders understand the seriousness of their mistakes. At the same time, however, we must not saddle them with judicial baggage that will stay with them for the rest of their lives.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013195">All of the members of this House understand how careful we need to be about burdening people with a criminal record, because it will stay with them forever. It will follow them everywhere—when looking for a job, when signing a lease, basically, it affects all aspects of everyday life. Such measures could force someone into a precarious situation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013196">I am being very careful. I really want to be clear that we are talking about minor transgressions. We know that people who commit serious crimes deserve a criminal record. We realize this and we obey the laws of our society. We respect the fact that the punishment should fit the crime. However, we really are talking about transgressions that do not warrant a criminal record. When we take a look at this process, what is really problematic is that summary trials are often overseen by a commanding officer who, for understandable reasons that I mentioned earlier, wants to instill discipline in the armed forces. This sense of discipline is so very important in our traditions and also in the work of the men and women of our Canadian Forces.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013197">When we realize that the commanding officer, understandably, may not really be interested in the concerns pertaining to criminal records, we have to bring clarity to the regulations. I believe that this must be one of the reforms we have to make. One of the amendments that we proposed was establishing a more complete list of the circumstances where a criminal record is, or is not, warranted.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013198">In closing, I would like to make one last very important point. One thing dropped from this bill is the composition of the grievance committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013199">I would like to make a comparison. In the United States, the founding fathers ensured that the commander in chief, or the U.S. president, is a civilian, not a member of the army. The objective was to balance the importance of a hierarchy within the armed forces and also within civilian society. Another recommendation we hoped would be adopted was that civilians make up 60% of the committee membership. That is another important measure that is unfortunately not in this bill. <I></I></ParaText>

From a purely legal perspective, this type of trial is not valid. When soldiers undergo a summary trial, they do not have the right to receive legal counsel to defend themselves. They are therefore at a clear disadvantage, which is unacceptable.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013225">A criminal record has fairly serious consequences. Soldiers can end up with criminal records as a result of reprimands. We understand that, in the military system, it is important that there be discipline and that soldiers follow certain rules. However, when soldiers become veterans and return to civil society with a criminal record, there are consequences for them. I think that is a problem. What are these reprimands for? Soldiers can be reprimanded for insubordination, misconduct, absence without leave and drunkenness.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3013226"> We are also talking about disobeying an order. We can see that this goes too far in some of these cases. Think about this: an individual who has served Canada and who has sacrificed himself or herself would be given a criminal record. The Conservatives keep saying that we must trust and value our military members. However, if they truly believe that, then why give military members a criminal record when they return to civilian society? What does it mean to have a criminal record? It can prevent you from working, from travelling outside Canada, and it can cause you problems every day, when you try to sign a lease, for example. Some problems are really more serious. That is why we asked the government to pay attention to that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013227"> The NDP made a number of specific proposals when this was studied by the Standing Committee on National Defence during the last Parliament. We suggested 27 “cases” in which a criminal record was unnecessary. A penalty might be necessary, no doubt a stiff penalty, but not a criminal record.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013228"> The <Affiliation DbId="170866" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> will say that amendments were proposed by the government, but we do not understand why the government has not done its job. This was discussed during a previous Parliament. Does this mean that the government does not respect what was previously done, the discussions, the debates and the recommendations made by the Canadian Forces? Does that mean nothing because they suddenly won a majority? Does nothing that is in the best interests of Canadians and veterans count any more because they have a majority? What counts now is their take on things.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013229"> We in the NDP understand that the system must be reformed, but it is a problem when they do not listen to what has been proposed and debated. The former chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, the Right Hon. Antonio Lamer, made recommendations in his report. Of his 88 recommendations, only 28 were retained. Why does this Conservative government always refuse to listen to what people have to say when solutions are proposed?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013230"> I have previously discussed the government's truly unacceptable attitude toward what veterans and the Canadian Forces request. This government does what it wants and does not listen to what people have to say. And we in the official opposition have a duty to promote these discussions. That is why we are debating this bill, which is imperfect. We understand the government's intention: it wants to reform the system. We agree with the government, but we believe this does not go far enough.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013231"> Let us look at the conflicts of interest in the grievance system. This is the situation if you have a grievance. The grievance review committee consists of retired members of the Canadian Forces. However, there may be some doubt about the impartiality and objectivity of certain committee members. Members may include commanders, for example. What we are seeking, and what the NDP proposed, in the way of specific solutions that could improve the system and that were proposed during a previous Parliament, is a slightly more civilian system, one in which 60% of committee members are civilians.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013232"> In that way we ensure that, when a grievance arises, the individual who says he or she has a problem is not punished, the process is a little more transparent, and there is less of a conflict of interest, which makes it possible to consider the matter.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013233"> Once again, our aim is really to help military members, those people who, in certain cases, must forge ahead. We respect that, but the government must respect what the opposition requests, but especially what veterans, the Canadian forces and the public request.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

This bill is a legislative response to some of the recommendations made by Justice Lamer in 2003 following his review of the National Defence Act and to recommendations made by the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs six years later. Of Justice Lamer's 88 recommendations, Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> takes just 28 into account. Sixty recommendations were not included in the bill that the Conservatives introduced in response to the key concerns raised by the Lamer report on national defence. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013251">In its current incarnation, the bill resembles previous national defence and military justice reform bills introduced in the House, such as Bill <Document DbId="2164205" Type="3">C-7</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="3314337" Type="3">C-45</Document>, which died on the order paper when Parliament was prorogued in 2007 and when the election was called in 2008.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013252">The following year, in July 2008, Bill <Document DbId="3546541" Type="3">C-60</Document> proposed a simplified courts martial structure and set out a precise method for choosing a type of court martial that would harmonize well with Canada's civilian justice system. It was introduced and debated in the House before being referred to the Senate committee that studies legal and constitutional affairs. After a painstaking review of the bill, the Senate committee made nine recommendations for changes to the National Defence Act.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013253">Later, in 2010, Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document> was introduced in the House of Commons.

It provides, among other things, greater latitude regarding the sentencing process and additional sentencing options, such as absolute discharges, intermittent sentences and restitution. It modifies the composition of a court martial panel according to the rank of the accused person, and the limitation period applicable to summary trials. It also allows an accused person to waive the limitation periods. In addition, the bill sets out the Canadian Forces provost marshal's responsibilities. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013256">As the NDP members who spoke before me pointed out, our party believes that the bill is a step in the right direction to bring the military justice system more in line with the civilian justice system. Unfortunately, it fails to address the fundamental issues that a serious military justice reform must tackle, including summary trials, grievances and measures that should be contemplated to strengthen the Complaints Commission.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013257">Because it is silent on these substantive issues, Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> seems from the outset to be unfinished business that has not been given proper consideration.</ParaText>

The Conservatives rejected all of these amendments.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013260">The NDP has long supported a necessary update of the military justice system, but not at any cost. We, New Democrats, think that members of the Canadian Forces are subject to extremely high disciplinary standards. Therefore, they deserve a justice system governed by similar standards.</ParaText>

New Democrats will continue to fight to make the Canadian military justice system fair for the men and women in uniform who have risked their lives in the service of Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013263"> That said, the weaknesses and flaws in this bill mean that we cannot support it. The following are some of the weaknesses in the bill that make it impossible for New Democrats to agree to it. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013264"> Let us talk about the reform of the summary trial system. The amendments in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> do not adequately address the injustice of summary trials. At present, a conviction in a summary trial in the Canadian Forces means that a criminal record is created. When summary trials are held, accused persons are unable to consult counsel. There is no appeal and there is no transcript of the trial. In addition, the judge is the accused’s commanding officer. This is too harsh for some members of the Canadian Forces who are convicted of minor offences. Those minor offences include insubordination, quarrels, misconduct and absence without leave. This is undoubtedly very important for military discipline, but it does not call for a criminal record. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013265"> Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> provides an exemption so that certain offences, if there is a minor sentence determined by the act or a fine of less than $500, will no longer lead to a criminal record. This is one of the positive aspects of this bill. We think this bill does not go far enough. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013266"> Last March, at committee stage, the amendments to Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document> proposed by the NDP called for the list of offences that could be considered to be minor, and not merit a criminal record if a minor sentence were imposed for the offence in question, to be increased to 27 from five. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013267"> This was an important step forward for summary trials. However, that amendment was not retained in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> and we want it to be included again. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013268"> A criminal record can make life after a person’s military career very difficult. With a criminal record, getting a job can be a thing of the past, and renting an apartment and travelling can be very difficult. Many Canadians would be shocked to learn that members of the military who have served our country so courageously can have a criminal record because of flaws in the military justice system. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013269"> Let us talk about reforming the grievance system. At this time, the grievance committee does not allow for external review. Retired employees of the Canadian Forces, some of them very recent retirees, sit on the committee. If the Canadian Forces Grievance Board is to be seen as an external, independent civilian body, as it should be, the appointment process needs to be amended to reflect that. This committee should therefore be composed, in part, of civilian members.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013270"> The NDP amendment suggests that at least 60% of the grievance committee members must never have been officers or members of the Canadian Forces. The amendment was adopted in March 2011, for Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document>, but it was not incorporated into Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>. It is important that this amendment be included again.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013271">Let us talk about the authority of the Chief of Defence Staff in the grievance process. One of the major weaknesses of the military grievance system is that, contrary to a recommendation in the Lamer report, the Chief of Defence Staff lacks the authority to resolve the financial aspects of grievances. Although the defence minister approved the recommendation, no concrete action has been taken in the past eight years to implement it. The NDP proposed an amendment to this effect when Bill <Document DbId="5634792" Type="3">C-41</Document> was at the committee stage. Although this amendment passed in March 2011, it was not retained in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>. The NDP will fight to have it put back in.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013272">Let us talk about strengthening the Military Police Complaints Commission. Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> amends the National Defence Act to establish a timeline in which the Canadian Forces provost marshal will be required to resolve complaints and protect complainants from being penalized for submitting a complaint in good faith.

There is currently nothing more important for Parliament to focus on than fixing a system that affects the legal rights of a significant number of Canadian citizens every year. Why? Because unless and until you, the legislators, address this issue, it is almost impossible for the court to address any challenge, since no appeal of a summary trial verdict or sentence is permitted. As well, it is almost impossible for any other form of legal challenge to take place, since there are no trial transcripts and no right to counsel at summary trial. </QuotePara></Quote>

They are always very proud to talk about their experience in the Canadian Forces. Sometimes it can be difficult. That is something to think about, because it is a whole other world. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013288">It is worth taking a moment to talk about this. I talk about it often with people at the Canadian Legion in Laval, which is in my riding. For example, I have coffee with Jocelyn and Marcel, who served in the Canadian Forces. Some people have never been members of the Canadian Forces, but have a great deal of respect for our military personnel and want to give of their time to them. When they return to their communities, our military men and women try to help out civilians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013289">For example, at the beginning of the year, Marcel from my riding went over the 500 mark for blood donations.

We have to do things the right way for them, especially when it comes to a bill about very important issues such as summary trials, which most of my colleagues have spoken about in the House.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013290">The first thing that struck me was the fact that not all the recommendations in the Lamer report were included, as my colleague just mentioned.

I expressed my concern about how people could easily end up with a criminal record, which is both troubling and hard to believe because these men and women give their time and, in some cases, many years of service.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013295">It is appalling to see that a criminal record could be so easy to get. Moreover, summary trials are not transcribed. That worries me because the accused cannot appeal.

These people sacrifice everything in service to their country, so why should they not have the right to appeal?</ParaText><ParaText id="3013297">I think that this is a serious flaw.

When we spoke about this bill in the House of Commons committee, a witness said that we were straying from the principle that the Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of Canada, as stipulated by section 52 of Part VII of the Constitution Act, 1982.

The short title is always the jazzier version, which is “strengthening military justice in the defence of Canada” bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013318">I will pause before diving into the details of Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> that concern me. I find the character of this debate at second reading, and I am sure anybody observing this on the parliamentary channel will also find it, unusual in that, so far, until I rose to speak on behalf of the Green Party, we have only been hearing from members of the official opposition.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013319">I do not know why this is. I think it is symptomatic of the unnecessarily partisan nature of debates in the House on legislation. There was a time, and I worked in Ottawa in that time, when working on legislation was not a partisan matter, but a largely co-operative and consensual matter to come to the best possible conclusions about how to improve legislative efforts before us.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013320">Amendments were not considered a threat to the government of the day. The amendment and the debate processes were seen as part of the role and proper function of Parliament. In that sense, it would be totally in keeping with parliamentary democracy to always see members on all sides of the House put their oar in at second reading and suggest where they think the committee, which will be the specialist members of Parliament on all sides of the House, will dig in and what the committee should focus on when it looks a bill, such as a bill of this nature, which is largely a good work but has areas that need fixing. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013321">We should approach debates in the House with much less partisanship. Every question I have heard from the hon. parliamentary secretary toward members of the official opposition has been to accuse them of somehow being hostile to the purposes of the bill or to try to stop it from being passed. I hear this far too often in this place.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013322">When parliamentarians from any side of the House speak to legislation, that is our role and our job and it is not a political game or waste of time. The very purpose and essence of parliamentary democracy is to ensure that legislation, which Canadians will have to live with for a very long time, is derived through the most exultant of intellectual processes invoking rigour, thought and research so we come up with the very best possible legislation, not the very nastiest of debates.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013323">With that set aside, I want to speak to the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013324"> I want to associate myself with the purposes of Canadian military justice as set out by someone who has been quoted quite a lot in debate today, a former colonel and now professor in the faculty of law at Ottawa University, Colonel Michel Drapeau.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013325">In this article, which originally appeared in the <I>Hill Times</I>, he set out very clearly where we were as we approached this debate today. He said:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013326"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">At the end of the day, Canadian military law, which incorporates both the criminal law of Canada as well as civil offences committed outside Canada, is a vital and necessary law in order to maintain discipline and order among the troops, and is believed to be one of the many reasons why the Canadian Forces are considered one of the world’s best, despite its small size. Considering the power that military law has over its audience, our citizen-soldiers deserve a world-class military justice system. A military justice system which is, first and foremost, just and fair to the accused while being responsive to the military need for discipline.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3013327"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> Obviously, the National Defence Act is still deficient in some major areas and it requires more than tweaks and tinkering to bring it into the 21st century.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3013328">That sets the context. This is not a wholesale assault on military justice coming from opposition benches. It is an attempt to ensure that this time that when we take a crack at military justice, considering that the comments and the work goes back to the work of Judge Lamer back in 2003, that we get it right in the 21st century.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013329">As a general comment, we have missed out because we are still reaching back to 2003, nine years ago, for our recommendations. They are good recommendations but the world has moved on in a number of areas.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013330">Again, as a general comment, I hope the committee will look at the reforms that have been taking place among many of our allied nations and friends, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, Germany and France, that have been looking at their military justice systems. I do not like using nouns as verbs, but since Professor Drapeau did it, I will repeat it, “civilianizing”, taking a military justice system and seeing if we cannot combine resources. His recommendation is that the military justice system be folded into the Federal Court. There would then be within the Federal Court a specific area of expertise around military justice. This would achieve quite a lot of efficiencies and cost savings, something the Conservative government usually likes.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3013331">Another comment from Professor Drapeau, which is overarching to this whole process, was why we were looking at the bill now when just last March, Justice Patrick LeSage was appointed to conduct a review of the military justice provisions of the National Defence Act. Would we not be wiser in the House to see what he recommended in light of all the things that have transpired over the last nine years since the report of Justice Lamer?</ParaText><ParaText id="3013332">In any case, in moving to some specific areas of concern about the legislation, I am sure the committee will look at this, but I hope it will be open to amendments.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013333">To the question of efficiencies and costs, it is quite surprising to find new judicial positions being created. Particularly, on the creation of a reserve force military judge panel, Mr. Drapeau noted that the current military judiciary had one of the lightest case loads of any branch in Canada. We know the Supreme Court of Canada has a heavy case load as does the Federal Court and most provinces. Under the weight of their case loads, justice grinds slowly. However, here we have a light case load with the creation of an additional reserve force military judge panel, which Professor Drapeau terms, “a costly extravagance”. We should look at that and see if we really need those provisions and additional judges.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013334">I want to direct most of my attention to the changes in grievance procedures. I will start the discussion by going back to Mr. Justice Lamer's report. Members can find this on page 86 of the report tabled to the <Affiliation DbId="111558" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> in September 2003.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013335">Mr. Justice Lamer puts it quite clearly. He wrote:</ParaText><ParaText id="3013336"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Soldiers are not second class citizens. They are entitled to be treated with respect, and in the case of the grievance process, in a procedurally fair manner....It is essential to the morale of CF members that their grievances be addressed in a fair, transparent, and prompt manner.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013337">It is here to which quite a number of Mr. Justice Lamer's comments were directed in his recommendations. It is important to set the grievance process in the context to which Mr. Justice Lamer set it. The rest of what we are dealing with in the act is important, but I am concentrating on this because I heard relatively less of it in debate at second reading. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013338">Unlike the rest of the military justice process, the grievance process is inherently non-adversarial. Nobody is being charged and it is not a question of whether members of our military force have access to a lawyer. It is a fundamental question of whether receipts have been honoured properly or that their working conditions are appropriate. It is in the standard management-labour context a grievance, but their grievances are treated differently.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013339">Mr. Justice Lamer said that we should use a process that is, in essence, co-operative. Certainly this is a place where I can see efforts to take Justice Lamer's comments onboard. His recommendation 75 is virtually verbatim in clause 6, which in the act would be section 29.11, to move matters along as informally and expeditiously as circumstance and fairness permit. However, there are many other recommendations of Mr. Justice Lamer that have not been dealt with in this act. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013340">One of the changes in the act for grievance procedures was not recommended by anyone. I query why we have to continually change the names of things but, for some reason, Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> would change the name of the Canadian Forces Grievance Board to the Military Grievance External Review Committee. Any time the name of a board is changed, although it may be a small matter, all the stationary needs to be redone. Why this change in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> instead of some of the more pertinent things that Mr. Justice Lamer wanted done with the grievance procedure?</ParaText><ParaText id="3013341">Right now grievance procedures still go all the way to the Chief of Defence Staff. The Chief of Defence Staff can delegate, but recommendation 78 would give the commanding officer a maximum of 20 days to try to explore alternatives to the grievance process before it would start to go up the hierarchy to the Chief of Defence Staff.</ParaText>

My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170508" Type="2">St. John's East</Affiliation> and others have been involved with the content of the bill for some time. What I find disconcerting is that here we are rehashing the debate when so much good work took place at committee, where recommendations and changes were made to the legislation. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013356">Yes, there was an election, so all of that work fell off the table. But when the government had the chance to put forward a bill that truly reflected the discussion that took place at committee, the kinds of testimony heard from top witnesses, it chose to discount the critical amendments to truly make the legislation what it could be, a piece of legislation that seeks to make military justice in Canada fair and truly just to the utmost extent.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013357">The NDP has been clear in recognizing that, while Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> is a step in the right direction to bring the military justice system more in line with the civilian justice system, it falls short on key issues: reforming the summary trial system, reforming the grievance system and strengthening the Military Complaints Commission. It is really about two fundamental values that we hold dear as Canadians: the concepts of fairness and justice. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013358">The reality is that we in the NDP believe that members of the Canadian Forces are held to an extremely high standard of discipline. It is something we all hold as such in our society. However, the members who put their lives on the line for our country deserve a judicial system that is held to that comparable high standard as well, something that is currently not the case and certainly will not be achieved by Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013359">Many Canadians would be shocked to learn that the people who bravely serve our country can get a criminal record from a system that lacks the due process usually required in civilian criminal courts. For us, it is critical to fight for more fairness in the Canadian military justice system for the women and men in uniform who put their lives on the line for service to our country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013360">I know a number of my colleagues have referenced the summary trial system and the importance of making sure we are moving forward in that respect. I would note that countries we often look to, Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland, have seen fit to change their own summary trial processes. The question is: Why is Canada lagging behind? We have the opportunity to follow in the steps of these countries, but also to set a leadership standard on our own and to clearly state as a priority that the military justice system stand for fairness and justice for people working in the military, something we civilians know to be the case when it comes to our system.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013361">In terms of the summary trial system, the amendments in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> do not adequately address the unfairness of summary trials. Currently a conviction of a service offence from a summary trial in the Canadian Forces may result in a criminal record. Summary trials are held without the ability of the accused to consult counsel, there are no appeals or transcripts of the trial and the judge is the accused person's commanding officer. This causes an undue harshness on certain members of the Canadian Forces who are convicted of very minor service offences.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013362">For example, some of the minor service offences include insubordination, quarrels, disturbances, absence without leave and disobeying a lawful command. These could be matters that are extremely important to military discipline, as we know, but they are not worthy of a criminal record. As we know, it remains a struggle for military personnel, once they leave the military, to get on and get settled with their life outside the military. Obviously a criminal record would be debilitating and further exacerbate the challenges many former military personnel face as they go on to pursue employment opportunities outside the military.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3013363">What better role could the Government of Canada play than to ensure that military personnel both have the justice they deserve while they are providing military service and also are not unduly penalized because of that unfair system once they leave the service? </ParaText><ParaText id="3013364">We noted that there needs to be reform of the grievance system. At present, the grievance system does not provide a means of external review. Currently it is staffed entirely by retired Canadian Forces officers, some only relatively recently retired. If the Canadian Forces grievance board is to be perceived as an external and independent oversight civilian body, as it was designed to be, then the appointment process needs to be amended to reflect that reality. Thus, some members of the board should be drawn from civil society. The NDP amendments have provided that at least 60% of the grievance committee members must never have been officers or non-commissioned members of the Canadian Forces. This is one of the amendments that was passed in March 2011 in Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document> but was not retained in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>, before us in the House today. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013365">The third point is about strengthening the Military Police Complaints Commission. Bill C-15 amends the National Defence Act to establish a timeline within which the Canadian Forces provost marshal would be required to resolve conduct complaints, as well as protect complainants from being penalized for submitting a complaint in good faith. Although this is a step forward, we in the NDP believe that more needs to be done to empower the commission. For example, care has not been taken to provide the Military Police Complaints Commission with the required legislative provisions empowering it to act as an oversight body. The commission must be empowered by a legislative provision that would allow it to rightfully investigate and report to Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013366">On that note, on the need to strengthen the Military Police Complaints Commission to ensure that those in the military have access to the kind of justice all Canadians would expect, the concept of ensuring the independence of complaints commissions and the ability to review and investigate what is currently taking place is something to which we need to see a greater commitment from the government side in a whole host of areas. One of the areas that has also been discussed is the RCMP. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013367">Despite the rhetoric we have heard from the government in favour of greater fairness for those working in the RCMP, the complaints commission there requires greater support. Canadians require greater assurance that the complaints commission of the RCMP will be independent. The reason I raise this is that we have heard about some serious allegations, some tragic stories around sexual harassment in the RCMP. That is something I am very concerned about, as the status of women critic for the NDP. There needs to be a policy when it comes to sexual harassment in the RCMP, but there also needs to be an assurance and clear legislative commitment to strengthen the independence and the role of the complaints commission. It is very much the same scenario in the case of the military. When we are talking about ensuring that members of the forces have access to justice and a fair system for recourse, we need to be looking at strengthening the Military Police Complaints Commission. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013368">Finally, what we are asking of the government, and certainly what we would have hoped for, is that it would have taken the deliberations of the committee and the final amendments made by the committee in hand and, rather than reinvent the wheel, recognize that the work has already been done and the template is already there to ensure that whatever we do with regard to strengthening military justice in Canada be done with access to justice and fairness for military personnel as a foremost priority. It is a priority for us in the NDP. We hope to see that same kind of reciprocation from the government at some point soon. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

That is the way I look at it.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013386">Among other things, the bill provides greater flexibility in the sentencing process. It provides additional sentencing options, including absolute discharges, intermittent sentences, and restitution. It modifies the composition of a court martial panel according to the rank of the accused person. It modifies the limitation period applicable for summary trials. It allows an accused person to waive the limitation periods and clarifies the responsibilities of the Canadian Forces Provost Marshal. It makes amendments to the delegation of the Chief of the Defence Staff's powers as a final authority in the grievance process.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013387">I do not want people watching at home to think that there are not some good things in the bill as it moves forward. The bill is a step in the right direction. It is a step in the right direction toward bringing the military justice system more in line with the civilian justice system. However, Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> falls short on key issues when it comes to reforming the summary trial system, reforming the grievance system, and strengthening the military complaints commission.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013388">In 2003, the Right Hon. Antonio Lamer, who is the former chief justice of the Supreme Court, presented his report on the independent review of the National Defence Act. It contained 88 recommendations. Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> is the legislative response to those recommendations, but to only 28 of those recommendations. Sixty are missing. Only 28 of those recommendations have been implemented by this legislation through regulations or by way of a change in practice.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013389">This legislation has also appeared here in earlier forms, first as Bill <Document DbId="2164205" Type="3">C-7</Document>and then as Bill <Document DbId="3314337" Type="3">C-45</Document>, which died on the order paper due to prorogation in 2007 and the election in 2008. In July 2008, Bill <Document DbId="3546541" Type="3">C-60</Document> came into force, and some changes were made at that time.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013390">In 2010, Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document> was introduced to respond to the Lamer report. It outlined provisions related to military justice, such as the things we are talking about today: sentencing reform, military judges and committees, summary trials, court martial panels, the provost marshal, and limited provisions related to the grievance and military police complaints process.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3013391">In essence, Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> is similar to the version that came out of committee in a previous Parliament. The amendments carried over include court martial composition and military judges' security of tenure, meaning appointments and age. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013392">However, other important amendments passed at the committee stage at the end of the last parliamentary session were not included in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>. These included, not surprisingly, NDP amendments that we felt were and are important. One was the authority of the Chief of the Defence Staff in the grievance process, which responds directly to Justice Lamer's recommendation. Another was a change to the composition of the grievance committee to include 60% civilian membership. Third was a provision ensuring that a person convicted of an offence during a summary trial is not unfairly subject to a criminal record, and that is no small thing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013393">Let me say again, because I know that my friend across the way will be asking me a question, that there are many important reforms in the bill. We support the long overdue update of the military justice system. Members of the Canadian Forces are held to an extremely high standard of discipline, and they, in turn, deserve a judicial system that is held to a comparable standard. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013394">However, there are some shortcomings in the bill, and we hope that they will be addressed at committee stage if the bill passes second reading. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013395">The first is the reform of the summary trial system. The amendments in the bill do not adequately address the unfairness of summary trials. Currently, a conviction for a service offence in a summary trial in the Canadian Forces may result in a criminal record. Summary trials are held without the ability of the accused to consult counsel. There are no appeals and no transcripts of the trial, and the judge is the accused person's commanding officer. This causes undue harshness for certain members of the Canadian Forces who are convicted of very minor offences. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013396">Some of these minor service offences could include, for example, insubordination, quarrels, disturbances, absence without leave, and disobeying a lawful command. These are matters that could be extremely important to military discipline but that I do not feel are worthy of a criminal record. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013397">Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> makes an exemption for a select number of offences if they carry a minor punishment, which is defined in the act, or a fine of less than $500 so that they no longer result in a criminal record. This is one of the positive aspects of the bill, but it does not, in my opinion and in the opinion of the NDP, go far enough.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3013398">At committee stage last March, NDP amendments to the previous bill, Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document>, were carried. They expanded this list of offences that could be considered minor and not worthy of a criminal record if the offence in question received a minor punishment.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013399">A criminal record could make life in the military very difficult and could make life after the military very difficult. Criminal records could make getting a job, renting an apartment, and travelling difficult. Many Canadians would be shocked to learn that the people who bravely serve our country can get a criminal record from a system that lacks the due process usually required in civilian criminal courts.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013400">The second amendment we talked about was a reform of the grievance system. I know that my friend across the way will probably have a question about that. At present, the grievance committee does not provide a means of external review. I think that is important. Our amendment provides that at least 60% of the grievance committee members must never have been officers or non-commissioned members of the Canadian Forces. The amendment was passed but was not retained in the bill as it stands today.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3013401">The third amendment concerns strengthening the Military Police Complaints Commission. I do not think care has been taken to provide the Military Police Complaints Commission with the required legislative provisions that empower it to act as an oversight body.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Prior to the last election, members worked studiously to amend the precursor to Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>, Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document>. The NDP was successful in getting several amendments passed to better protect the interests of the men and women who serve in the Canadian Forces. For example, the NDP made changes concerning the authority of the Chief of Defence Staff in the grievance process. We were also successful in changing the composition of the grievances committee so that 60% of members would be civilians, and we were successful in ensuring that a person convicted of certain minor offences in a summary trial would not receive a criminal record.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013667">The Conservative government took advantage of the fact that the bill died on the order paper and of its new parliamentary majority to scrap the compromise reached in the previous Parliament. That is wasteful and undemocratic.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013668">We support several measures contained in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>. For some time, we have supported the modernization of the military justice system. After all, members of the Canadian Forces are subject to very strict disciplinary standards and deserve a justice system that is subject to comparable standards. However, we believe that the bill could go a lot further. We must take advantage of Bill C–15 to reform the summary trial and grievances systems, and to strengthen the Military Police Complaints Commission.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013669">Let us start with summary trials. It is important to know that most disciplinary matters are judged at a summary trial level. Usually, they deal with less serious offences, such as insubordination, quarrels, misconduct, unauthorized absences, drunkenness and disobedience. There are two problems with this system, in our opinion. To begin with, several minor offences can result in a criminal record. These offences are undoubtedly very important in terms of military discipline, but they do not warrant a criminal record.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013670">A lot of Quebeckers and Canadians would be shocked to learn that the people who served our country so bravely could end up with a criminal record for a simple offence such as insubordination. It is an even greater pity that this type of offence significantly complicates the lives of these individuals after they leave the military. Criminal records make it difficult to get a new job, limit opportunities to travel abroad and make getting an apartment more difficult.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013671">The British Columbia Civil Liberties Association noted in February 2011 that the primary concern of the military officers imposing sentences in a summary trial is likely to be unit discipline and deterring future violations, not the effect that a criminal record will have on an accused in the civilian world.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013672">Allow me to digress for a moment while I am talking about the transition of military personnel to civilian life. Just today, the Auditor General of Canada published a report that came down very hard on the Conservative government in terms of the transition of ill and injured military personnel to civilian life. The report revealed a web of red tape that complicates this transition. Here is an excerpt from that report: </ParaText><ParaText id="3013673"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Canadian Forces members and veterans, as well as...staff...find the transition process complex, lengthy, and challenging to navigate....[I]t remains difficult to access services and benefits in a timely manner. Reasons include the complexity of eligibility criteria, lack of clear information on support available, the amount of paperwork involved, and case management services that require further improvement.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="05">(1505)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3013674">In short, the Conservative government still has a long way to go to help our military personnel transition smoothly to civilian life, whether they are injured or not. We believe that the federal government should take advantage of Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> to make this transition easier by significantly reducing the military offences that carry a criminal record.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013675">The Conservatives will say that Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> already reduces the number of offences that carry a criminal record. That is one of the good things about it; however, in our opinion, the bill should go much further. In the last Parliament, we proposed that the list of offences that could be considered minor and thus not worthy of a criminal record be expanded, if the offence in question received a minor punishment. The amendment also expanded the list of sentences that could be imposed by a tribunal without an offender incurring a criminal record, such as a reprimand, a fine equal to up to one month's basic pay or other minor punishments. Clearly, we will once again propose these amendments in committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013676"> Moreover, with the summary trial process, neither the procedures nor the rights of the accused are the same as in civilian courts. For example, it is not possible to appeal the verdict or sentence from a summary trial in a court of law. Any form of legal appeal is virtually impossible, because there is no transcript of the trial and the accused cannot be represented by counsel.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013677"> We in the NDP believe that if a person risks serious consequences such as acquiring a criminal record or serving a prison term, that person should be entitled to the best protection the law can provide, in terms of procedure. This principle was reiterated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Wigglesworth in 1987.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013678"> I have talked a lot about the issue of summary trials, but I also want to raise two other problems with Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013679"> For years, the Canadian Forces Grievance Board has been the subject of many complaints. We believe that part of the problem is that it is not an independent, external, civilian body. Some current members of the board are retired Canadian Forces members. To highlight the independent nature of the grievance board, clause 11 of the bill amends subsection 29.16(1) of the National Defence Act to change the name of this board to the Military Grievances External Review Committee. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013680"> We think that the government should follow through and require that at least 60% of the members of the grievance committee must never have been officers or enlisted personnel in the Canadian Forces. This proposal was adopted in March 2011, in relation to Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document>. However, it was not retained in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>. It saddens us that the Conservative government is thus undermining the serious work accomplished by all the members of the Standing Committee on National Defence and disregarding the earlier recommendations made by representatives of the Canadian Forces. It is important for this amendment to be considered again.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013681"> We also believe that the military grievance system could be substantially improved by granting more power to the Chief of Defence Staff to settle the financial aspects arising from grievances. We will have more amendments on this issue. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013682"> Finally, I would emphasize again the importance of protecting from unfair punishment the people who file grievances in good faith. We believe that the powers of the Military Police Complaints Commission should be strengthened so that it can act as a watchdog. The commission should have the power to investigate and to report to Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013683"> In conclusion, I hope the government will take the time to consider our amendments, in order to better protect the men and women who serve in our armed forces.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="10">(1510)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Alexander" id="7735350"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170866" Type="18">Mr. Chris Alexander (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3013684">Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's remarks are not logical.

What has happened so far? Nothing has taken place.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013698">First, we had a Liberal government that chose to ignore it and not do anything during the time it was in power.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013699">Then we had a Conservative government, which, to its credit, actually brought forward a bill. However, not to its credit, the Conservative government decided to prorogue Parliament, so the bill died on the order paper. That was Bill <Document DbId="2164205" Type="3">C-7</Document>, and that was back in 2007. At that point, we were now four years from these recommendations having been made.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013700">In 2008, we had Bill <Document DbId="3314337" Type="3">C-45</Document>. Again, the Conservatives brought forward a bill, but they then called a snap election, in violation of their own election law. That ended up killing that bill on the order paper again.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013701">Finally, in 2010, Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document> came forward. At the committee stage, the government and all parties agreed on amendments to Bill C-41. Why we are standing and talking about this so vociferously is that those amendments have been removed by the government. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013702">It is audacious. It is arrogant. It is not in keeping with the good practices of Parliament that when we reach agreement on issues we can agree upon, they are removed. The Conservatives have done this over and over again. They have done it with the refugee system. They have done it with this act. It seems as though the government does not want to pay attention to what all Canadians are saying but only to what those sitting opposite are saying.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013703">We have specific issues with this bill. One is the authority of the Chief of the Defence Staff in the grievance process. We recommended in Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document> that more authority be provided, which was a direct response to Justice Lamer's recommendation. That was agreeable to the government two years ago. It is not agreeable to it now. What is going on?</ParaText><ParaText id="3013704">There were changes to the composition of the grievance committee to include 60% civilian membership. Again, in Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document>, clause 11 was amended. The government agreed to it, and we thought we could go forward with it. Again, it has been removed. What does the government have against that kind of agreement?</ParaText><ParaText id="3013705">I was a union representative for many years, way too many years. A grievance process is something that has to be seen to have a just end. To have a just end, there has to be a final and binding resolution given independently of the two parties that are at odds. In the normal employment relationship, it is the employer and the employee. In this kind of employment relationship, it is the military and the soldier. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013706">When soldiers have a grievance, they take it to the military. We believe that they need to see that this grievance process will be done in a timely fashion and that it will have a final and binding end, which will be a non-partisan decision. That decision, as in a labour arbitration by an arbitrator, will be made by someone who is independent of the two parties. As long as the government and the military can keep appointing members and ex-members of the military to be part of that final process, it will not be seen to be justice.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013707">Maybe in the long run we can come up with these changes. We might have a better chance of making these changes in 2015. For now, we are astounded that the government would agree, and then only two years later choose not to agree.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013708">Finally, we requested changes to clause 75 in Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document> to ensure that a person convicted of an offence during a summary trial is not unfairly subjected to a criminal record.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="20">(1520)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3013709">For those who are non-military, a summary trial is much like what goes on between the boss and an employee. An employee screws up and he or she is hauled into the boss's office and the boss has a whole range of disciplinary measures that can be meted out. That person can be sent home without pay or demoted. Ultimately if it is severe enough and has happened often enough, the employee can be fired or can be sent for help. There is a whole range of options as to what can be done. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013710">That is very similar to what goes on with a summary trial. The individual is not usually entitled to legal representation when hauled into the boss's office. There are no notes kept or record of this trial. The only record might be of the decision to cause a penalty. In large measure, a summary trial is very much like what goes on in a workplace. The trouble is that in the military a summary trial can cause a person to have a permanent criminal record.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013711"> That could never happen in anybody else's employment anywhere in Canada. There is nowhere that a person could gain a criminal record without having been through a criminal trial with the right to representation, the right to not incriminate oneself, the right to be heard in front of a judge and the right to a jury if necessary. Those kinds of things go on in criminal trials. They are the kinds of things that our democracy stands for, and for which these soldiers go into battle to try to create in other countries. Here we are telling them they are not entitled to them themselves, that they are not entitled to the same protections that other Canadians are entitled to.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013712"> A criminal record carries with it some very severe consequences. It is very difficult for people to find a job when they come out of the military if they have a criminal record. It is very difficult to travel. As we know, recently at the border Canada has stopped people who have criminal records from coming into Canada. These people will have difficulty getting into other countries if they have criminal records. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013713">It is not just and it is not right that from what is basically a meeting in the boss's office, people are labelled for the rest of their life as having a criminal record. That is the kind of thing that we need to remove from the bill. We understand that the government has moved some way toward that, but it has not gone the whole hog. It has not gone to the same level of decisions that we suggest do not deserve a criminal record in a summary trial.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013714">I want to give an example of how the current military grievance process is not effective. I am trying to assist a person in my riding who had a grievance against the military, who had left the military because he was told that the best way to get what he needed done was to leave and come back. When he tried to go back, he was refused and he grieved it. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013715">He wrote to the commanding officer who said, “I can't do anything until you grieve it”, so he filed a grievance. The response to his grievance was that he was out of time and should have filed it months ago. However, now he had an answer so he wrote to the boss and the boss said, “You're right. That rule that says you should be able to come back was what was in place at the time so we should have let you back. I'm now changing that rule retroactively so you can't come back”.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013716">That is the kind of military justice, the kind of end to a grievance process that happens in the armed forces right now, and it makes a mockery of the system. Why call it a grievance process if that is what can happen? We might as well not have one. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013717">There is a grievance process for good reason. It is because there are times when people need to sit down and talk out what happened. People need to sit down and actually work out that a promise was made and not kept or that a decision was taken that was not just, and find a way around that. However, at the end of that process, there needs to be an impartial decision-making body.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013718"> Justice Lamer recommended it and we agreed. We proposed an amendment in the last Parliament and the government agreed to our amendment, but it is not here. The only excuse I have heard from the Conservatives so far has been that it would be disenfranchising 700,000 people who were former members of the military from being on this tribunal. That leaves 34 million other people to be on that tribunal.

The intelligent use of these reports is often a good indication of a government's will to act. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013734">In the case before us, the results are rather disappointing. When the Right Honourable Antonio Lamer, a former Supreme Court justice and an expert on today's issues, tabled his report in the fall of 2003, we had before us 88 recommendations concerning military justice, the Military Police Complaints Commission, the grievance process and the Canadian Forces Provost Marshal.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013735">After many attempts, Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> was expected to be an answer to the many recommendations of the Lamer report.

Therefore, in order to move forward, it is better to rely on our side of the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013736"> So we are disappointed, because only 28 recommendations have been incorporated into the bill. What is most unfortunate is that important previous amendments that were adopted at the end of the last parliamentary session have not been included in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>. Allow me to point out here that for a government that so often proclaims itself to be the champion red tape reduction, this seems to be a contradiction. The work had been done. There was an agreement. But oops, into the recycling bin with it; well, at least I hope it is the recycling bin, for all this work. They are starting the process over again, but they are putting even less on the table this time. This is a strange way of advocating efficiency and optimization of the work within our own institution.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013737"> This brings us to the heart of this bill, and since time is short, I will focus on the issues relating to summary trials, because in my opinion, these are probably the issues that most affect the clients I served for 25 years. I am talking about young students who, for all sorts of reasons in their lives, choose a military career, whether because it is suited to their innate personal tastes, or they wish to pursue their education or to acquire some specialized skills. But the one thing that all of these young people have in common is that they are young. I am by no means persuaded that at the time of their enlistment, they are familiar with all the ins and outs of the commitment they are making.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013738"> The NDP has long been in favour of a much-needed overhaul of the military justice system. The military justice system in our country today is still a draconian system. It is a legacy from a military tradition that is no longer suited to our times. Changes are long overdue.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013739"> The bill that is before us, however, has to enable us to tackle the problems head-on. In spite of everything, this is a unique opportunity to examine our military justice system. So let us not shy away from the debate, and let us try, if possible, to improve this system again. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013740"> The members of the Canadian Forces have to meet high disciplinary standards, and it is easy to understand why. However, we are asking in return that the justice system that is applied to them be just as precise and exacting. That is the least we should offer our soldiers. This is a matter of the relationship of trust between the armed forces and the justice system they are subject to. That is why the NDP is disappointed with the result we see in this bill. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013741"> Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> does not adequately address the injustice created by summary trials. I will cite a few of the incongruities found in this bill. Do we think it reasonable that, in the military of a country that recognizes the rule of law and a democracy as advanced as ours, summary trials are held where the accused cannot consult counsel? Do we think it is acceptable for accused persons to be unable to read transcripts of their trials, for the simple reason that there is no trial?</ParaText><ParaText id="3013742"> I am well aware that the government is battling red tape, but even so, in matters as sensitive as justice, whether military or civilian, I think a trial transcript is a guarantee against errors and abuses. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="35">(1535)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3013743">I would like to quote retired Canadian Forces Colonel Michel W. Drapeau, who is an expert on military law. He was outraged about the legal consequences of a conviction in summary trial. He said:</ParaText><ParaText id="3013744"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentRest="2" IndentFirst="2">...it is almost impossible for the court to address any challenge [by a convicted soldier], since no appeal of a summary trial verdict or sentence is permitted. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3013745">That is another incongruity in our system.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013746">Colonel Drapeau went on to say:</ParaText><ParaText id="3013747"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">As well, it is almost impossible for any other form of legal challenge to take place, since there are no trial transcripts and no right to counsel at summary trial.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3013748">That is another incongruity if ever there was one.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013749">Again, is it acceptable for the judge to be the accused person's commanding officer? If that is not a conflict of interest, it sure looks like one.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013750">In my opinion, all these provisions are much too severe in many cases. Yes, there is misconduct within our armed forces and this must be sanctioned. We understand that, but often these are minor offences that do not merit a criminal record.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013751">I took a quick look at what could be considered minor offences. These include things such as quarrels, misconduct, absence without leave, drunkenness or disobedience. I taught teenagers and witnessed, identified, confronted, and dealt with all of these characteristics time and time again. It is often between the ages of 16 to 18 that a person thinks about enrolling in the army. These are very common—and temporary—characteristics among teenagers who are trying to adjust to the adult world. Every one of these behaviours taken independently in civilian life would likely not have serious consequences. But in military life it is a whole other story.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013752"> Let us remember that our armed forces must be disciplined and exemplary at all times, of course. Therefore, any improper behaviour or flouting of the rules, discipline or code of conduct that govern the armed forces must be fairly punished. But we also have to remember that our soldiers must not lose confidence in their own justice system.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013753"> Within the military justice system, the summary trial is the most common kind of tribunal, with 96% of all cases being determined by summary trial. Many soldiers experience this particular kind of military justice at some time in their career. It is a disciplinary method for dealing with infractions committed by Canada’s military personnel. The other 4% of cases are the exception, the court martial. It is a good thing that this is the proportion. It proves that lack of discipline in our armed forces is a rather rare phenomenon. Summary trials are available to deal rapidly with small infractions of the military sort. It can be done rapidly, within the unit, to maintain discipline.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013754"> The issue I want to raise concerns the legal consequences of these summary trials. Are all Canadians aware that a minor conviction in a summary trial leads to a criminal record? That is a fundamental problem.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="40">(1540)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3013755"> I will repeat the example given by a Liberal colleague about someone who dropped a cigarette butt in a garbage can rather than an ashtray, where it belonged according to regulations.

Still, there is an enormous difference between the treatment this offence would get in the military system and in the civilian one. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013756"> I will get straight to my conclusion.

The Canadian Forces deserve a military justice system that respects these values in all instances, including the grievance system and complaints commissions. The Conservative government chose not to do that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013779">The government has decided to go against an amendment already passed at committee, which would allow changes to the composition of the grievance board to include a 60% civilian membership, amended clause 11 in Bill C-41.

I will continue to speak about the reasons why we will unfortunately not be able to vote in favour of this bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013784"> This bill was introduced after a series of bills that were passed in the House of Commons over the past 10 years. First there were bills <Document DbId="2164205" Type="3">C-7</Document> and <Document DbId="3314337" Type="3">C-45</Document>, which died on the order paper when Parliament was prorogued in 2007 and the election was held in 2008. In July 2008, the government introduced Bill <Document DbId="3546541" Type="3">C-60</Document>, which came back stronger and simplified the structure, but it too died on the order paper. In 2009, the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs studied this bill and recommended nine amendments, but it went no further.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013785"> In 2010, Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document> was introduced, and it reached committee stage, where amendments were proposed. Unfortunately, it too died on the order paper. That brings us to Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>. As my colleagues have mentioned, amendments had been proposed in committee and accepted, but they are now being dropped.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013786"> I would like to comment on what my colleague just said about the arrogance of the government. It repeatedly tells us that we do not want to work with it, that we vote against its bills and that we are opposed to all kinds of things. Then it comes and tells us that we are opposing a better bill on military justice for veterans.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013787"> This bill contains many things that we cannot accept. Furthermore, we had proposed some amendments that I believe were very appropriate. We had recommended changes to the composition of the grievance board to have it consist of 60% civilians. We had recommended that authority be given to the Chief of Defence Staff in the grievance process, in direct response to a recommendation made in the Lamer report.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3013788"> We had proposed that a person convicted of an offence in a summary trial ought not to be unfairly subjected to a criminal record.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013789"> I would like to return to the criminal record. At the moment, the Canadian Forces system is very strict and discipline is very important. These people represent our country. They have to be upright, fair and, as it were, highly disciplined.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013790"> At the moment, five of the offences considered minor do not lead to a criminal record. This means that out of 27 such offences, 22 can lead to a criminal record.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013791"> I have not looked at my list, but my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170320" Type="2">Trois-Rivières</Affiliation> just mentioned that one of the offences was being absent without leave. I find it ridiculous that being absent without leave can result in a criminal record.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013792"> I am going to tell you about a personal experience. Before coming to this place, I taught adults at two schools, in Sherbrooke and Quebec City. Unfortunately, a lot of young adults in my courses had criminal records. They told me how much that restricted their lives and complicated their efforts to look for work, for example. They always had to answer the question about whether they had a criminal record. They obviously had to tell the truth. Those people told the truth. They said they had a criminal record. Naturally, that can scare an employer. If you are more knowledgeable and you know what sort of behaviour resulted in a criminal record, that can change things.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013793"> Having a criminal record can also prevent you from travelling. It is harder to go to the United States, for example. Someone who has completed his military career and saved up money to go to the United States and spend a weekend with his children at Disneyland could be denied entry to the United States because he has a criminal record. This can take on grotesque proportions.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013794"> I feel we have an opportunity to change that. Some things are abnormal and disproportionate. You can have a criminal record for being absent without leave. These are things that we can change, and we should seize the opportunity to do so since we are studying the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013795"> The government tells us that the wheels of bureaucracy grind slowly and that moving things forward takes a long time. I agree: sometimes it does take a long time and that is why we have been studying the bill for 10 years.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013796"> We do not want this bill to die on the order paper. We want it to be passed, but passed logically and responsibly so as to move things forward.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013797"> We can decide that some offences that are considered minor will not result in a criminal record. This is the opportunity to do so now, and we must not miss it.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013798"> I wanted to add to what the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association says, that military officers who impose sentences at summary trials want to maintain unit discipline and discourage future offences—everything is fine to that point—not to inflict on the accused consequences consistent with having a criminal record in the civilian world.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013799"> The British Columbia Civil Liberties Association thus emphasizes the fact that a criminal record has consequences in the civilian world. We would not want to go too far.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013800"> As I mentioned earlier in my speech, it is very important for the military world to be highly disciplined, but this goes a little too far.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013801"> We are definitely in favour of reforming the legislation concerning the military system.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="00">(1600)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3013802"> The bill does not go far enough. Only 28 of Justice Lamer's 88 recommendations were adopted, not even half. None of the amendments put forward by the NDP was adopted either. In our view, this bill does not go far enough, and we will vote against it in the next vote for that reason.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

My colleague was just talking about that. We have been talking about it, looking into it and studying it since 2003.

But it does not go far enough—as we have said since the debate began today—in reforming certain aspects of the act that I think are essential. Moreover, the bill only includes only 28 of Justice Lamer’s 88 recommendations. The fact that this bill does not go deep enough is disappointing, particularly because many significant amendments proposed by the NDP and adopted by the committee studying Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document>—which covered the same subject but was shunted into oblivion by an election call—have unfortunately not been included in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>. All opposition MPs have said this during the debate. Certainly, we are repeating ourselves, but it is important to say that the work was done in committee, that experts gave their opinions, that the Canadian Forces also made recommendations, and that there was a report.

This was the result of significant collaboration among members of all parties. This kind of work does not deserve being reduced to nothing. By not including all our amendments in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>, the Conservatives are devaluing the important work done in committee and that of the defence department, as well as the recommendations made by representatives of the Canadian Forces during the last Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013820"> Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> still has many shortcomings. We call upon the Conservative government to amend the bill more thoroughly so that the National Defence Act and other related acts can be properly reformed.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013821">The summary trial system, which is probably one of the most outrageous aspects of the current military justice system, requires some major changes. The current amendments to Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> do not go far enough in addressing the injustice created by summary trials. Do members know what a summary trial is? Most Canadians have no idea what a summary trial is, and they would be shocked to learn that some Canadian citizens are subjected to this type of procedure. A summary trial means that a Canadian Forces member is judged by his commanding officer, in other words his boss, without the right to a lawyer, to an appeal, and without any transcript of the trial. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013822">Currently, a summary trial conviction in the Canadian Forces also results in a criminal record. The summary trial is the most frequently used disciplinary method to deal with offences committed by Canada's military personnel. For example, in 2008-09, 96% of the cases were decided by summary trial. I want to condemn the excessive harshness of summary trials in the case of minor offences.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3013823">Minor offences include insubordination, quarrels and misconduct. It seems disproportionate that a conviction for this type of offences should lead to a criminal record.

For example, a criminal record means that the individual will have a very hard time finding a job, renting an apartment, and even travelling.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013826">Do we think all these consequences resulting from a minor offence are excessive and even unfair? I do. It makes no sense. It is totally unfair and it is not in line with what we are asking from members of our armed forces. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013827"> This matter had already been covered by an amendment when Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document> was being studied. In fact, the NDP suggested lengthening the list of offences that could be considered minor and that did not merit a criminal record if the offence in question led to a minor punishment. The NDP asked that the list be increased from 5 to 27 offences. It also asked that the list of punishments that could be handed down by the court without leading to a criminal record be lengthened. That changes everything.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013828"> Why is this amendment, which was agreed to last spring, not included in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>? Does the bill ensure that some offences will no longer result in a criminal record? It is inadequate. The bill must go farther. The amendments proposed by the NDP need to be included, as they were in Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document>. The military justice system must absolutely adapt to the realities of the 21st century. The current rules and provisions are truly obsolete. The United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland have already deemed it appropriate to change the summary trial process.<Sup></Sup></ParaText><ParaText id="3013829"> At what point will Canada follow suit? Why is the Conservative government dragging its feet on such vital issues as human rights and the rights of Canadian soldiers who, I would like to remind everyone, are Canadian citizens?</ParaText><ParaText id="3013830"> After all, would we not be utterly outraged if this sort of thing happened in a civilian context? I am certain that no one would accept it. Canadians would be absolutely shocked to find that soldiers who have so bravely served our country can end up with a criminal record because of flaws in the military justice system.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013831">Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15 </Document> must also include a reform of the grievance system. At the moment, the grievance board, which is supposed to be independent, does not allow for an external review of the grievances at issue. Even more ironically, Bill C-15 is changing the name of the board to the “Military Grievance External Review Committee”. I cannot see how changing the name makes the committee any more independent. The employees working for this committee are armed forces retirees, which does not make the body truly external and independent.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013832"> Meaningful amendments have to be made to the appointment process. In March 2011, the NDP suggested that 60% of members of the grievance board be people who had never been officers or non-commissioned members of the Canadian Forces. This amendment was kept in Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document>. At the risk of repeating myself, can the government explain to us yet again why this amendment is no longer in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>? I believe that keeping it in the bill is essential.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013833"> Still on the topic of the grievance process, the NDP also condemned the Chief of Defence Staff’s lack of authority to resolve financial considerations stemming from grievances.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013834"> What is more, there is the matter of the complaints commission. We are asking that the powers of the commission be increased so that it can investigate and report to Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013835"> For all these reasons, because the government has transformed Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document> into the completely unjust, inadequate and incomplete Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>, the NDP will oppose it.

Bill C-15 is intended to strengthen military justice and as a response to the reports of former chief justice Antonio Lamer and of the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013852"> Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> in fact includes only 28 of the Lamer report's 88 recommendations. It is essentially the latest attempt to strengthen military justice. One need only think of Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document>, introduced in 2010, which was also an attempt to respond to the Lamer report. However, the various parties and the government managed to reach a degree of consensus on that bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013853"> We made a series of amendments to that bill through negotiations in committee. Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> is far from being a perfect copy of Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document>. Bill C-15 does not include the important amendments that committee adopted in the last Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013854"> Those amendments included some of the NDP's proposals respecting the authority of the Chief of Defence Staff in the grievance process, consistent with one of the recommendations of the Lamer report. Changes were also recommended to the composition of the grievance committee so that 60% of its members would be civilians. Lastly, there was the provision guaranteeing that a person convicted of an offence during a summary trial would not unfairly be given a criminal record.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013855">Obviously, this bill contains a number of important reforms. The NDP's support for an update of the military justice system is not a recent development. We have observed for some time that there is a genuine need in this area. That is simply logical, given that Canadian Forces members are subject to regulations that are harsh, to say the least. In the circumstances, this situation must be offset by establishing a legal system that is subject to at least comparable standards. However, a number of necessary differences between military and civilian justice must be taken into consideration if we want that justice system to be truly fair.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013856">Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> has a number of flaws that the government needs to consider. The bill's flaws can be divided up into three specific areas: the reform of the summary trial system, the reform of the grievance system, and the strengthening of the Military Police Complaints Commission.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013857">Regarding the reform of the summary trial system, the amendments in this bill were not adequately examined. Certain members of the Canadian forces convicted for minor offences face tough procedures that will inevitably lead to a criminal record. Moreover, under this judicial process, accused persons cannot consult counsel, and the judge is none other than the accused’s commander. Such a simple and quick process is appropriate in a purely disciplinary context within the Canadian Forces, but what is being proposed here is quite another matter.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013858">It needs to be made clear that having a criminal record has a real impact. It is not a simple matter of discipline, as is the case in the armed forces, and for good reason. Such a change will have damaging consequences for members of the armed forces in their civilian lives, which is why it is important to make the distinction between the notions of civilian and military in summary trials.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013859">It is important to be mindful of the types of minor military offences, and contrast these with what the bill sets out in terms of criminal offences. An important legal distinction must be made in a context like this where the rights of the accused are at stake.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013860">All that to say that the process involved in the reform of the summary trial system will not lead to fair trials and could significantly hurt members of the armed forces in their civilian lives for no good reason.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013861">The sentences resulting from summary trials are not only intended to have this effect. They are intended to provide an example, strengthen discipline and discourage future offences. With this in mind, the process could be considered normal for the armed forces, given the minor violations and offences that are dealt with there, but those hardly merit a criminal record.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3013862">Summary trials are designed to expediently dispose of minor military offences. This fundamental difference between courts martial and summary trials must be stressed. It is clear, based on the figures concerning the treatment of offences committed by Canadian military officers, that the majority of cases are subject to a summary trial. Only a minority of offences are subject to court martial.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013863">Let us discuss some of the infamous criminal offences in question. They include, for example, insubordination, quarrels, misconduct, absence without leave and disobeying an order. These are not criminal offences, they are breaches of military discipline. A criminal record, however, will, for obvious reasons, make rejoining civilian life difficult. Getting a job, renting an apartment and, for those who like to travel, travelling abroad, will become difficult.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013864">It is important to note that, on average, Canadian Forces members tend to retire at a much younger age than other Canadians. Thus we see just how many problems this can cause for our military personnel. Is there not a more appropriate way to ensure that justice is served than to impose a criminal record, the effects of which are hard to determine, on people who are being tried for a minor offence without a professional judge and without a formal defence?</ParaText><ParaText id="3013865">Furthermore, the amendments that we proposed to Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document> to expand the list of offences and sentences that are not worthy of a criminal record were not included in this bill. These were sentences that were deemed to be minor and not worthy of a criminal record but that warrant disciplinary measures not exceeding a fine equal to one month's basic pay. This is an important nuance, and we must ensure that these amendments are included in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013866">Another amendment that was not included in this bill pertains to the reform of the grievance system. We wanted at least 60% of grievance board members to be civilians who have never been an officer or a member of the Canadian Forces. This is a critical requirement if we want to ensure that the grievance board is perceived as an independent, external civilian body, as it should be.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013867">We also proposed an amendment to give the Chief of Defence Staff more authority in the grievance process. Nothing was done in this regard. We must ensure that grievances are quickly resolved in a fair and transparent manner.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013868">Another one of the shortcomings of this bill pertains to the Military Police Complaints Commission. We must increase the commission's authority so that it is able to rightfully investigate and report to Parliament. We must further strengthen the commission by giving it more power to act as an oversight body. This is one of the shortcomings of this bill since this issue was barely touched on.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013869">Today we are talking about reforming the military justice system, in order to bring it more in line with the civilian justice system, while ensuring that the justice process is fair and just for members of the Canadian Forces. That is not the case with a number of the proposed amendments in this bill. Overall, the bill tends to create problems instead of solving existing ones. The government must review this bill and include our amendments that were adopted in committee as part of the study of Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document> and that have disappeared in this bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013870">We owe it to the members of the Canadian Forces to give them a justice system that is fair and just.

The way the system of justice in the military is set up right now, a soldier can receive a criminal record for very minor offences, such as insubordination, quarrels, disturbances, absence without leave and even drunkenness. These matters could be extremely important to military discipline, and we would probably all agree on that, but they are not worthy of a criminal record. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013890">A criminal record can make life after the military very difficult.

These include the following NDP amendments: the authority of the Chief of the Defence Staff in the grievance process, responding directly to Justice Lamer's recommendation; changes to the composition of the grievance committee to include 60% civilian membership; and a provision ensuring that a person convicted of an offence during summary trial is not unfairly subjected to a criminal record. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013898">If one member of the government would get up at this point, I would ask what in those amendments was so scary and offensive that the government would pull them out of the bill before reintroducing it. However, I doubt that I will have that chance. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3013899">I am opposing Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>, as it contains shortcomings that need to be re-addressed because the amendments I mentioned were pulled from the previous version of the bill. Far too often the government takes bills that were fixed and then breaks them again before bringing them to Parliament. It is a trend that we are seeing again and again. In the next two and a half years before the next election, I wonder how many other things Conservatives are going to break anew before bringing them before Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013900">The amendments in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> do not adequately the unfairness of summary trials and the conviction of service offences from those trials in the Canadian Forces, which result in a criminal record. Summary trials are held without the accused being able to consult counsel; there are no appeals or transcripts of the trial; and the judge is the accused person's commanding officer. I wonder how many of us in civilian life would ever want to be tried by our boss.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013901">These trials are unduly harsh for certain members of the Canadian Forces who are convicted of very minor service offences. Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> does make an exception for a select number of offences if they carry a minor punishment defined in the act, or a fine of less than $500, so they will no longer result in a criminal record. This is one of the positive aspects of the bill, but it does not go far enough.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013902">At committee during the last Parliament, NDP amendments to Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document> were carried to expand the list of offences that could be considered minor and not worthy of a criminal record from 5 such offences to 27. If the offences in question received a minor punishment, one the NDP amendments also extended the list of punishments that might be imposed by a tribunal without an offender incurring a criminal record, such as a severe reprimand, a reprimand or a fine equal to one month's basic pay, or another minor punishment. This was a major step for summary trials. However, this amendment was not retained in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>. We want to see it included. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013903">Another matter that needs to be amended relates to the external military grievances review committee. At present the grievance committee does not provide a means for external review. Currently it is staffed entirely by retired Canadian Forces officers, some only recently retired. If the Canadian Forces grievance board is to be perceived as an external and independent oversight civilian body, as it is designed to be, then the appointments process needs to be amended to reflect that reality. Thus, some members of the board should be drawn from civil society.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013904">The NDP would like to see a provision that at least 60% of the grievance committee members never have been officers or non-commissioned members of the Canadian Forces. This amendment to Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document> was passed in March 2011, but again it was not retained in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>. There seems to be no good amendment that the Conservatives do not want to see gone. It is important that this amendment also be put back in the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013905">Another major flaw in the military grievance system is that the Chief of the Defence Staff presently lacks the authority to resolve any and all financial aspects arising from a grievance, contrary to a recommendation in the Lamer report. Despite the fact that the <Affiliation DbId="111558" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> at the time agreed to this recommendation, there have been no concrete steps taken over the past eight years to implement this recommendation. The NDP proposed an amendment to this effect to Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document> at committee. Although the amendment passed in March 2011, once again this amendment is nowhere to be found in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>. It should be included.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013906">Another aspect of the bill that needs to be addressed is the need to strengthen the Military Police Complaints Commission. Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> amends it to establish a timeline in which the Canadian Forces provost marshal will be required to resolve and conduct complaints as well as protect complainants from being penalized for submitting a complaint in good faith. Although a step forward, the NDP believes that more needs to be done to empower the commission. Care has not been taken to provide the Military Police Complaints Commission with the required legislative provisions that would empower it to act as an oversight body.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013907">I will be happy to answer some questions.

I met his lovely fiancé and it is wonderful to know that they will be married soon.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013931">I would like to begin my remarks by saying that over quite a few years in this House I have debated many bills. However, it is very unusual and rare to hold a debate in which there is basically one party participating. There is something going on here that we will have to get to the bottom of.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013932">I appreciate that so many members of the NDP caucus, the official opposition, have taken the time today to get up in their place and debate this very important bill. They have given some substance and historical background on where this bill came from and what the problems are with the bill today.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013933">In fact, I remember you, Mr. Speaker, debating the bill in the last Parliament. It was Bill C-41 then, a forerunner of this bill and very similar in its provisions. I have to say that we certainly miss you in the House debating bills, but we are very happy to see you in the chair as Deputy Speaker.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013934">Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> has a long history and it is about a very important matter that is long overdue for reform, that being our system of military justice. As the member for <Affiliation DbId="170336" Type="2">Scarborough Southwest</Affiliation> just pointed out, there are other countries that have dealt with this issue in a proper and adequate way, yet we are lagging far behind.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013935">The original report by the Right Hon. Antonio Lamer, the former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, was presented in 2003. That is quite a few years ago and it worries me that it has taken this length of time to bring forward a bill, which will presumably go to committee. We hope that it will come back from committee in a form that includes the amendments the NDP proposed so long ago.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013936">Military justice is a very important issue, particularly the principle that members of the Canadian Forces have access to a system that is fair, balanced and that protects their rights. In fact, after reading through the bill to see what it would and would not do, there are a lot of fundamental questions about why the members of the Canadian Forces have been living under a system where their rights have basically been disregarded for so long.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013937">Even though we support many elements of the bill and think it is a step in the right direction, there are three key issues that we have been hammering away at today because they are not in the bill. The bill does not go far enough on the need to reform the summary trial system and the grievance system and to strengthen the Military Police Complaints Commission. I would like to focus on these three elements.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013938">Regarding the summary trial system, what immediately jumps out at one when reading the bill is that it does not adequately address the unfairness of it. As noted by my colleagues, members of the armed forces can be drawn into some of these summary trials, as we are told, on issues that are meant to be of a minor nature. However, the fact is that they can end up with a criminal record.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013939"> They have no right to consult counsel, there are no appeals or transcripts of the so-called trial, and the judge is the accused person's commanding officer. This has to be the most fundamental injustice. It is very disturbing that it has continued for so long. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013940">Dealing with the issue of the summary trial system and bringing in reforms is something that I think is imperative for members of the armed forces and for anyone in this country who has a notion of the justice, balance and fairness that need to be afforded to people.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="55">(1655)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3013941">We are very concerned that the bill does not address this fundamental question. Some of the so-called minor service offences could include things like insubordination, quarrels, disturbances, absent without leave, drunkenness and disobeying a lawful command. In a civil system, people could be charged with those things and if they actually went to court, they would have a lawyer, a hearing, a judge and may even have a jury. However, in this system, the summary trial system, none of those things would happen, but people could end up with a criminal offence. This is a serious problem that we face in the bill. We want to see it corrected.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013942">As many of my colleagues have pointed out, when the bill came forward in its last form, Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document>, the NDP worked very hard to get the bill changed. In fact, when it was at committee last March, we wanted to expand the list of offences that could be considered as not worthy of a criminal record from 5 to 22.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013943">We worked very hard at the committee. I was not on the committee, but I am sure there were witnesses who were heard. We know there were a number of major witnesses and organizations that sent in information, like the BC Civil Liberties Association, which put forward the concerns and fundamental flaws with the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013944">Therefore, we brought forward those amendments and they were approved at the committee. That is an example of committee work that was doing something. It was constructive. Amendments were proposed that would improve the bill, which is what is meant to be done at the committee level.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013945">Lo and behold, we come back to the House, a new bill comes forward, Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>, and those amendments are not present in the bill. That is a serious problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013946">As a matter of principle, we are opposing this bill at second reading. I guess it is a form of protest to say that the process here has been seriously undermined and that the government should have acted in a responsible way, looked at the constructive work that was done on earlier versions of the bill and ensured that it came back in a way that reflected the will of the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013947">It is very unfortunate that none of the members on the government side have been willing to answer that question today. We have raised it repeatedly in the House. It is a very straightforward question. We have asked each other those questions, because the government members will not answer. We have asked why the Conservative members and the Conservative government did not include those amendments.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013948">We do not know for sure. We can only suppose that it is some level of unilateralism, some level of arrogance that the government thinks it can ditch that and does not need to pay attention to it. If that is not the case, we sure wish the government members would get up and explain why these amendments are not in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013949">The second key item that we wish to raise is the reform of the grievance review committee. Again, this is a very fundamental process system that has to do with military justice. In this instance, we had amendments and things we had worked on to strengthen the bill. It is really a very straightforward principle.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013950"> It is the idea that there needs to be some sort of external, independent component. In fact, the NDP amendment that had been put forward in committee previously had specified that at least 60% of the grievance committee could not be an officer or non-commissioned member of the Canadian Forces. Again, this amendment was passed under Bill <Document DbId="4620437" Type="3">C-41</Document>, but is not been retained in Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>. Having some independence, some broader scope on a grievance review committee seems, to us, to be a pretty important thing. It begs the question why it is not there.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013951">Finally, our third concern is about strengthening the Military Police Complaints Commission. We believe, and again there was an amendment to this effect, that it should be seen as an oversight body. There has to be somebody who looks at the system overall and has some independence and must be empowered to actually investigate and report back to Parliament. On that too, it is silent. It is absent.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013952"> For those three reasons, we are not supporting this bill at this time.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Lamoureux" id="7736642"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170750" Type="2">Mr. Kevin Lamoureux (Winnipeg North, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3013953">Mr. Speaker, in principle, Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document> attempts to narrow the gap, as I referred to earlier, between civil court and military court. The principle of what it attempts to do is something which we in the Liberal Party do support and ultimately would like to see passed to committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013954">We have a number of concerns. We, too, would like to see amendments. I am somewhat surprised that the New Democrats have decided not to allow it to go to committee.

Therefore, it makes it very difficult to support the bill in principle.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013958">I would note, because the question came from a Liberal member, that the Lamer report came out in 2003 when the Liberals were in power. They did respond positively to the report at that time, but they also sat on it. We are really lagging in time in what has happened with this whole system of military justice.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013959">I am sure the bill will go to committee. We have taken a position that we do not support the bill in principle because it is so flawed. However, once it gets to committee, I know our members will again try to ensure the bill is corrected and comes back in a much strengthened and better form.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. MacKay" id="7736684"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="111558" Type="4">Hon.

I am glad to see the <Affiliation DbId="111558" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> added his two cents to the debate, but we really hope we will have other members of Parliament from other parties join in. The debate we are having is extremely important when it comes to our Canadian Forces and modernizing the Canadian Forces.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013968"> As has been mentioned, it was the Right Hon. Antonio Lamer, one of our sharpest jurists, who contributed to our country in many different ways. We honoured his passing just a couple of years ago. I had the opportunity to get to know him a bit from a social point of view and he was someone who contributed to our system in so many ways. He had also examined concerns around the issues of justice in Newfoundland and helped reform some of the systems there. When he brought forward his report in 2003, it was thorough. It was also a blueprint for what we needed to do. We needed to, in his opinion, modernize the justice system within the military.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013969">It is strange when the government talks about getting the bill to committee and getting it done. As my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170224" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation>, the bill was before us in two different iterations. One of the times it went through the House with a minority Parliament, but it was stopped abruptly because of prorogation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013970"> It comes with a qualifier when the government criticizes anyone in the House, particularly us, about slowing things down. The Conservatives pulled the fire alarm on the House of Commons with prorogation because they were worried about holding on to power.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013971">The other thing that is important to understand in the bill and its context is the government has constantly talked about the importance of our military, the importance of supporting the troops and ensuring that is a brand of theirs. However, when we look at how that works, whether it is the reforming the justice system, as we are debating today, or supporting veterans, particularly for those who are coming back from the conflict in Afghanistan, there is a gap between the rhetoric of the government and the results.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013972">In the context of the bill there are things like the Military Police Complaints Commission. We went through a very long debate over the role of the Military Police Complaints Commission when we debated the question of detainees. It came up in the House during debate that the government was not being responsible and responsive when it came to supporting the Military Police Complaints Commission. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013973">The Conservatives changed the chair. They did not renew the chair's mandate because the chair of the Military Police Complaints Commission was doing the job. The Conservatives were not sufficiently supporting the Military Police Complaints Commission with documentation and that led to a parliamentary crisis in the end, which someone in your chair, Mr. Speaker, had to rule upon.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013974">It is important that we understand the context. If the Military Police Complaints Commission is not able to do its job sufficiently, then that puts the system at risk. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013975">The reason we set up these bodies is so there will be a fair hearing, a due process. That is extremely important. However, if the executive branch interferes with that and does not support the Military Police Complaints Commission, either in the appointment of the chair or ensuring that it has all the material sufficient to do its work, then we have a dilemma. The dilemma is that the commission is no longer really independent because the independence of the Military Police Complaints Commission is compromised because of lack of co-operation from the executive branch. We cited this before in the case with the Department of National Defence and the minister in providing documents, and ultimately up to cabinet.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3013976">We need to see more clarity. As others have mentioned, this issue has been examined in other jurisdictions. The MPCC is an important institution that was set up to deal with issues like those we saw with the Somalia inquiry and what happens when things go wrong within the military. It is a different organization obviously, a different institution, and it does require different methods in terms of dealing with issues around justice, but we really do have to modernize here. We have been very vocal and clear that the MPCC needs to be given full independence. The government needs to comply with the requests it makes and not put barriers in its way.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013977">The bill does not go far enough to really address some of the issues around grievances, as was mentioned by my colleagues.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013978">With respect to the summary trial system, I just want to read into the record again some of the important statistics around the use of summary trials. Summary trials are seemingly the dominant disciplinary method that is being used by the Canadian military. A lot of people are shocked to note the statistics we have available. Between 2008 and 2009, there were a total of 1,865 cases, 96% of which were determined by summary trial. The other 67 were heard by court martial, 4%. It is important to note that if we do not deal with the issue of summary trials, then we are really not dealing with the big problem, and that is modernizing our system of justice within the military. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013979">If the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland are able to deal with this legacy of summary trials, then why can we not deal with it here? I have just listed Westminster models, and they are able to do that, so it is certainly not a question of our parliamentary system. The countries I just listed were able to do it. They are all within the Westminster tradition. Why is the Conservative government not able to see that, to put that forward? We have put this case forward many times. We were debating this particular bill in its previous iterations when the Speaker was a member on the floor of the House. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013980">The government is saying it will just get it done when the bill gets to committee. Government members already know what the problem is. Why did they not deal with it before? Why did they not deal with it perhaps after the second iteration? Here we are the third time. The government could have dealt with it. If the government is going to deal with it in a fulsome way, it could have put that in place. It could have strengthened the Military Police Complaints Commission and dealt with the whole issue of summary trials and grievances.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013981">As I stated before, the military is a different institution. My father was a sergeant who served in the second world war. He used to joke about what his role was within the military. He was at times a disciplinarian with the troops because he was a sergeant. There was a code and they had to follow it. That was then, but times have changed. It is time to modernize, and that is why at this point it is difficult for us to support the bill at second reading. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013982">We look to the government to tell us why it did not get the job done before. We ask the other opposition parties to see the problems we have. Let us get this done right. Let us get this done well, so we can fully support our troops.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Lamoureux" id="7736781"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170750" Type="2">Mr. Kevin Lamoureux (Winnipeg North, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3013983">Mr. Speaker, having been a member of the Canadian Forces, I do appreciate the importance of trying to narrow the gap between the civil system and the military system, as I have referred to in the past. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013984">One of the issues that has always come up is the issue of not being able to report in to work. There is quite a different consequence for someone in the military who does not report in to work compared to a civilian who does not report in to work. I am wondering if the member could just provide his thoughts with regard to that sort of disciplinary action. Does he recognize that there is a difference? </ParaText><ParaText id="3013985">On the other hand, there are many different types of offences that could apply for a civil court system, such as representation for many of the summary convictions that other members of this caucus have made reference to.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Dewar" id="7736792"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170296" Type="2">Mr. Paul Dewar</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3013986">Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned in my comments, we acknowledge that when it comes to the Canadian Forces, to the military, it is a different institution, so for the example the member gave, it is obvious there is a propensity, and an understandable one, to deal with situations differently. That said, we really have to take a look, and I mentioned the stats of the use of summary trials, and see that this is an outdated method of dealing with justice for our military and it is time we respect the forces and the institution itself and modernize it. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013987">As I said, this has been done in many other jurisdictions.

The Conservative member wants to get the bill to committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013989">My question for my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170296" Type="2">Ottawa Centre</Affiliation> is: Considering the fact that the House has passed dozens of bills, maybe hundreds, since the government became a majority and we have been able to make amendments to one bill, maybe two, can the hon. member tell me what the chances are of our making good amendments to Bill <Document DbId="5156729" Type="3">C-15</Document>, or are we not going to be able to do that?</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Dewar" id="7736805"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170296" Type="2">Mr. Paul Dewar</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3013990">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170294" Type="2">Nickel Belt</Affiliation> for his question because many people are wondering that. There is a question around the functioning of our parliamentary democracy right now, when we have time allocation used regularly, when we have omnibus bills brought in anytime the government wishes to get anything done, bypassing normal parliamentary scrutiny.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013991">When it comes to committees, we have seen that going in camera is too often used. The rationale for Parliament to do its job is to be able to provide scrutiny and alternatives to bills and amendments. I sadly say to my colleague that it is very unlikely that government would accept the amendments. We have tried that. We have made the case here, and as we have said before, please take our ideas, adopt them, let us get some results happening. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013992">Conservatives have said it will happen later. There is a certain trust on that. We have not seen support for putting forward our ideas adopted by government, so for those of us who have watched the government in a minority and now a majority, it is a matter of whether it is true that the government is really focused on getting things done for the best results for Canadians, or whether it is more about how it is using its majority power just to get things done for its own political benefit. Sadly, I think it is that. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013993">We need to address that in our system. We need to see committees work better. We have to stop the business of time allocation and certainly stop the pattern we have seen from the government of bringing in omnibus legislation, because it is deeply affecting our parliamentary democracy and therefore the health of our democracy.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Julian" id="7736810"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170651" Type="2">Mr. Peter Julian (Burnaby—New Westminster, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3013994">Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise to speak on behalf of military families across the country. Like many people in the NDP caucus, I have relatives—my grandfather and uncle—who both fought for Canada and their names figure on the memorial in downtown New Westminster, just outside the city hall. There are many members of Parliament in the NDP caucus who are strongly supportive of the immense sacrifice that military families and members of the Canadian Forces make on behalf of the country. They put their lives on the line every day. Without question, they follow the directives that are provided through the democratic framework we have here in Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013995">When we talk about veterans who have put their lives on the line, those who have lost their lives in so many tragic cases and those who are currently serving in the military, we know they are entitled to our respect. They are entitled to the respect of Parliament for what they do on our behalf every day. We have a bill that was brought forward by the Conservative government, yet another example—and I will point to a few other examples in the few minutes I have remaining—that shows a profound disrespect for military families and members of the Canadian Forces.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013996">We have a bill that was flawed from the outset. The NDP went to work and put forward amendments that received the support of the committee and Parliament. Yet the government is trying, through a back door, to resubmit flawed legislation that was improved through NDP action but was obviously flawed when the government put it forward.</ParaText><ParaText id="3013997">I know there are military families listening to the debate today, from some of the emails members are getting, who are very supportive of what NDP MPs have been saying in the House of Commons. I will point out one example of how flawed this legislation is, with the summary trial system that the government seems intent on ramming through. We see that a member of the Canadian Forces who may have had a few drinks one night or may have put his cigarette in the wrong place can receive a criminal conviction that will carry through for the rest of his or her lifetime. This point has been made by NDP MP after NDP MP. We have not seen one Conservative stand to defend this legislation, and we can certainly understand why. It is so badly flawed. </ParaText><ParaText id="3013998">To say that a member of the Canadian Forces who has just a few too many drinks one night is entitled, as a reward for that, to have a criminal conviction that may last the rest of his or her life is absolutely absurd and ridiculous. Yet the Conservative government is saying it does not care about the military or Canadian Forces personnel; it is going to ram this through come hell or high water. It is simply unacceptable. It is unacceptable.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Comartin" id="7736844"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="185261" Type="22">The Deputy Speaker</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3013999">The use of that term in that context is inappropriate and unparliamentary, and I would ask the member to withdraw it.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Julian" id="7736845"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170651" Type="2">Mr. Peter Julian</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3014000">Mr. Speaker, I will rely on your wisdom. It is a common expression but I withdraw it. </ParaText><ParaText id="3014001">The reality is that what we have is a government that is bent on pushing through this legislation without amendment, when the NDP amendments that we brought forward before and that were adopted by the House and by committee are obviously in the best interests of Canadian Forces personnel.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014002">When we look at the pattern of the government and what it has done in a very clear way against the Canadian Forces military personnel and military families, what we see is a pattern of disrespect. There is no other way to put it. It is refusing amendments to flawed legislation that puts Canadian military personnel in a very awkward situation, to say the least. On top of that, we see what has been the pattern of the government, a record of disrespect for Canadian Forces personnel and for veterans. </ParaText><ParaText id="3014003">I will give some examples. First is cutting $226 million from Veterans Affairs Canada. That eliminates 500 employees. The Conservatives can say that is fine and that they will find another way to provide services. However, as many NDP MPs have pointed out, as our critic for Veterans Affairs has pointed out on numerous occasions, there is no doubt that it has a net impact on services provided to veterans. There is absolutely no doubt that it shows disrespect to military forces personnel and to veterans. </ParaText><ParaText id="3014004">We have seen case after case. Our team on the Veteran Affairs side, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170509" Type="2">Sackville—Eastern Shore</Affiliation> and the critic as well, the member from Quebec, have been pointing out in the House that many veterans who need access to services are being denied those services, such as those veterans who need access to psychologists through the Department of Veterans Affairs and have seen their applications denied. </ParaText><ParaText id="3014005">We have seen World War II veterans who were denied reimbursement for stair lifts to access the upper and lower levels of their homes because they were not considered essential living spaces. We have seen veterans who have been denied care at the veterans hospital because they were not seen as meeting very strict criteria, even though they were veterans in the service of our country. We have seen, a number of times, the personal medical files of Canadian veterans being released to the public. </ParaText><ParaText id="3014006">This is not a series of accidents. The debate that we are having today, where the government is refusing to improve badly flawed legislation that hurts our Canadian Forces personnel, is an example of a pattern of disrespect. </ParaText><ParaText id="3014007">On this side of the House, the NDP caucus will stand up for Canadian Forces personnel. We will stand up for our veterans because we believe it is right to do so. They put their lives on the line for our country and the least that we can do in this Parliament is to ensure that legislation respects them. This legislation does not. That is why we oppose it. That is why we are voting no. </ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Comartin" id="7736874"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="185261" Type="22">The Deputy Speaker</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3014008">The hon. member will have two and a half minutes to complete his speech when the bill is next called to the House.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Therefore, there is no controversy, in case people start spinning this up. There were discussions held on this, and we certainly agreed with that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014052"> We would welcome the opportunity to make a few remarks about the bill. First, I would like to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="170525" Type="2">Kitchener—Conestoga</Affiliation>, as well as the senator who came before the health committee and spoke about the bill. We had a good discussion. We were very clear at the health committee, when we dealt with it a week ago, that we in the NDP very much support a day in recognition of autism and the impact it has on Canadian families. </ParaText><ParaText id="3014053">As the member alluded to, if there is any slight criticism it is that this really is a bill about an awareness day. We would hope to see much more meaningful action take place, as many members in the community have called for, families who are living with autism. There are some very severe needs that need to be addressed. For us, this is an issue about certainly giving recognition but needing to do more than that. That is our point.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3014054">I would point out that a number of our members have also had bills on autism. The member for <Affiliation DbId="170261" Type="2">Vancouver Kingsway</Affiliation>, put forward Bill <Document DbId="5204100" Type="4">C-351</Document>. That has been a very important bill that he put forward. There is also the member for <Affiliation DbId="170117" Type="2">Sudbury</Affiliation>, who has had two bills calling for action to better support those living with autism. That is the kind of meaningful action we need to see.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014055">We in the NDP are somewhat concerned that for a number of years the government has not taken the kind of leadership that is required on this issue. We do see many organizations calling for a national strategy. In fact, there were promises made to have a national strategy on autism. That is something that is very important to do. I know the member for <Affiliation DbId="170525" Type="2">Kitchener—Conestoga</Affiliation> probably supports that. I hope he will encourage his government to now go further and build on the day of awareness we have.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014056">The only other point I would like to make is that much has been said overall in this debate, in the first hours of debate, but there is new information that is coming out. One of the issues is an issue of gender, which on the surface appears to be an issue about age. This has to do with where early intervention is provided.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3014057">The fact is that there are some estimates that the average age of diagnosis for a girl on the autism spectrum is 12, whereas for boys it is between the ages of 5 and 7. What happens is that, because early intervention often takes place around the age of 5 or 6, many girls are actually being cut out of that early intervention.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014058">This was something that was brought to my attention by a family in Nova Scotia who actually have three daughters who are on the autism spectrum. It is something to factor in about what needs to be done, to understand the kinds of supports families need to have and to understand, when we say early intervention, that it actually has to be appropriate to the ages of children when they are diagnosed. Certainly intervention is important, but it has to be appropriate and it has to meet the needs of the children at the ages they are being diagnosed.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014059">I did want to make that point today, because I do think it is something that helps build the debate on this issue. In conclusion, I would again say that, in the NDP, we have supported this bill. We supported it at committee. We are happy to let it go on a voice vote today, which means it will be approved.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3014060"> However, we would use this opportunity to say to the government members who have been supporting this bill, and indeed to all members, let us see this as a first step, let us build on this issue, let us hold the government to its commitments for a national strategy, and let us support the families in their needs, as well as people who are living with autism, because there is much more that needs to be done.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Hedy Fry (Vancouver Centre, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3014061">Mr. Speaker, like my colleagues in the House, I want to support the member for <Affiliation DbId="170525" Type="2">Kitchener—Conestoga</Affiliation>, who suggested that we make some quick comments and then take it to a voice vote. </ParaText><ParaText id="3014062">The Liberal Party supports this very much and we are very grateful to Liberal Senator Jim Munson, who brought the bill forward. However, I do want to add some comments.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014063">My hon. colleague for <Affiliation DbId="170224" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation> discussed the fact that gender is a huge issue in terms of early diagnosis. We know that early diagnosis is very important to get the kind of early interventions one needs. However, there are some other things I want to highlight.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014064">I was quite impressed and moved at a conference I was at this weekend in British Columbia. It was an international conference with people from eight countries, all of whom themselves were autistic or on the spectrum disorder at some level. I heard some things from them that, even as a physician, I was not aware of and that moved me greatly. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3014065">We talk about this as a spectrum disorder, which becomes an illness, a diagnosis, et cetera. However, I was very much moved by the people in that room, from eight countries, in that that they did not want people to see them as a disorder. They wanted people to understand that many of them are functioning well and have great ability. They need people to understand the nature of autism in its full spectrum. </ParaText><ParaText id="3014066">It was interesting when the member for <Affiliation DbId="170224" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation> talked about diagnosing girls at about 12. I met women with Aspergers who belong to the Asperger Women Association, who were diagnosed at 50, 42 and 35. </ParaText><ParaText id="3014067">We see that we do not understand, in fact, that many people with autism function in our society. However, the people at the conference commented that they are discriminated against in society. Sometimes at home and school there is a certain protection for them, but when they go out into the real world they are discriminated against. They cannot get jobs. They find that people look at them as if they have a mental disability, when many of them have extraordinarily high IQs. Many are extremely talented artists. Some are very verbal and very good at all kinds of communications, not necessarily verbal ones.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014068">I heard that they wanted the schools to understand them and not discriminate against them. They are subject to bullying a great deal and they wanted to deal with that issue.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3014069"> As we talk about awareness, they very much want people to understand the fact that they are very able. Many of them are highly functioning. I met people there that day who had extraordinary IQs that were much higher than mine. They would be at genius levels. I also heard that they are concerned about their human rights.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014070"> I heard some moving things. For instance, they do not want people to fix them or cure them, but they do need support, understanding and opportunity to participate fully in jobs and the economic, cultural and social sectors. This is where I want to put a plea on the table. I was extremely moved by that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014071"> As a physician, I had understood the spectrum disorder very differently. However, I do not even want to talk about it as a spectrum disorder anymore. As a physician, I saw it as a problem for a long time and not necessarily as something where a person would say they were born autistic, that is who they are and they are happy with the gifts they have. They just want opportunity, understanding and the ability not to have people say they want to fix them.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3014072">In fact, some said that family doctors, psychologists and psychiatrists have told them that if they are functioning well they should not tell anyone they are autistic. If they did not tell anyone, they would not be discriminated against. It was kind of like telling the LGBT community, as in the old days, to stay in the closet and not to come out. </ParaText><ParaText id="3014073">I want to put that to members here so that we can understand people with autism spectrum disorder very differently from how we have tended to understand them.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I am very heartened by the members of all parties saying they want to bring this to a vote tonight. I am also heartened, listening to two members of the opposition who have been around here for a long time, who have both said they have learned something new about autism in the last little while. I am excited about that. I look forward to having further conversations with them. If there is any way I can help them increase their understanding any more, or put them in touch with others who may also be able to express similar types of challenges, certainly I would be glad to do that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014075">I want to recognize a few people today, if I could. I want to thank Senator Munson for moving this bill in the first place. I really appreciate that. I appreciated having the opportunity to work with him on this issue over time. I want to thank some government ministers: the <Affiliation DbId="170705" Type="96">Minister of Health</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="128694" Type="4">Minister of Human Resources</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="170678" Type="4">Minister of National Revenue</Affiliation> and staff who we worked with to try to move some of the issues.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3014076">The opposition members talked about some of the challenges. We have had the opportunity to bring forward some of those challenges to these various ministries and their staff, and stakeholders have been received very well as we have tried to move some of these issues forward. I want to thank those ministers.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014077">I want to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="170525" Type="2">Kitchener—Conestoga</Affiliation> for picking up the bill in the House and for his very enthusiastic support of it, as with everything he does. The vigour and the positive attitude with which he supported this have been really encouraging.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014078">I am doing a lot of thanking today, but I have spoken a lot about the issue. I want to thank my own staff, who I do not thank enough, for their work on this issue. They have embraced the issue as their very own. They have embraced Jaden as though he is their family member. It is a lot of work on top of the regular life of an MP. The work they do to raise awareness of this issue on top of their regular workloads is astounding, and I really want to thank them for that. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3014079">Jaden and I had the opportunity to go to New York a couple of weeks back. We went there for a UN event. The World Autism Awareness Day actually arose out of an initiative by the UN and Bob and Suzanne Wright, who founded Autism Speaks. It arose out of conversations they had. They have continued their work to raise awareness on this important issue. </ParaText><ParaText id="3014080"> We were there for a couple of days, and while we were there we had a chance to speak to the spouses of world leaders. There were 15 or 16 spouses. We actually spoke with the Prime Minister of Bangladesh and the President of Panama at the same time. We were very enthused and excited. We had the chance, as we were speaking to them, to play a bit of football in front of them. I had to explain that North American football is a bit different from the football most of them are used to. We do that to settle Jaden down, because he sometimes gets very excited and intense when we are doing some of these things. Playing football kind of calms him down, so we had the chance to show them how that works for him.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3014081">While we were in New York, I was constantly working, so Jaden was grabbing my shoulder and hanging off my shoulder, staring at my BlackBerry the whole time because he had to be on top of what the schedule was, but he was more excited than I have ever seen him in two days. We really had a fun time. </ParaText><ParaText id="3014082">We went to Times Square on Friday night and, in terms of autism awareness, one of the things we have to be aware of as parents is that when we are in situations like that, Jaden is very excited, hanging off my shoulder, but if he gets two feet away from me in a crowded atmosphere like that, I might never find him again. We had the opportunity to experience Times Square together with all the excitement of the bright lights and everything else. It was a spectacular time.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3014083">We had the chance to do about five media interviews while we were there. I do want to recognize the folks in the media who have really worked to raise awareness of this issue. David Ariosto from CNN did an interview with us, and so did David Common from CBC. They both got it immediately. They both understood Jaden immediately. They made that connection with Jaden, and their stories reflect that. That was similar to the things that Tom Clark and Steve Paikin and Evan Solomon have done here when they have had the opportunity to raise awareness. We talked to Marci Ien at <I>Canada AM</I> and a lady named Susan James at ABC News. All of them really took an interest in this issue. It was not just another day in their lives of work, but they actually took an interest in really raising awareness of this issue. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="50">(1850)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3014084">They had a chance to get to know and connect with Jaden and move that issue forward. I want to thank them for doing that and for taking the time to go above and beyond in their approach to this.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014085">I do not want to take much more time. I know that we want to pass this bill. No one wants that more than I do. However, I would be remiss if I did not thank the families of people with autism. When it comes to autism awareness, we can do a lot in the House, but it is the families that model the grace, perseverance and love for their family members, the sons, daughters, siblings, and in some cases, parents, who may not have been diagnosed until later in life as being on the spectrum. No one who advocates is more aware of the challenges than they are. They live every day with this. We discuss it once in a while in the House, but every single day those families live with this. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3014086">We heard the hon. member down the way refer to individuals with autism and their own unique perspectives. There is certainly a whole variety of unique perspectives. When we focus on the challenges, we also have to focus on the amazing, unique skills and talents these people have. As a society, we need to try to find ways to include them, take advantage of their incredible strengths, and learn from them. They make our lives better. My life is infinitely better because my son Jaden is involved in it. I would say that everyone in the House who has had the opportunity to meet Jaden, without exception, would say that their lives are better for having had the opportunity to give him a high five, a hug or a kiss.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014087">With that, I will close. I thank all members from all parties for the way they have embraced Jaden during the time I have been a member of Parliament. God bless them all.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We are all somewhat familiar with autism, but I would like to provide some information about autism in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014090">In Canada, although there is a lack of detailed epidemiological data, there are currently around 48,000 children and 144,000 adults with some form of autism. It is estimated that one in 150 children in Canada is autistic. We know that the rate of autism is increasing every year without a discernible cause. Boys are much more susceptible than girls to be affected by autism. It is estimated that autism is four times more common in men than in women. Autism is more prevalent than childhood cancer, AIDS, and diabetes combined. It is estimated that treating an autistic person in Canada can cost between $80,000 and $100,000 a year.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3014091">These figures reflect the scope of the situation. That is why we will definitely support this bill. In fact, we would like to do so as quickly as possible. </ParaText><ParaText id="3014092">This awareness day will help organizations specializing in childhood illnesses, such as the Autism Society of Canada, promote public awareness of this illness and perhaps go further and make parliamentarians aware of the importance of developing a broader strategy. I see this bill as a first step. </ParaText><ParaText id="3014093">Last year, I talked about another bill dealing with the establishment of an illness awareness day. At the United Nations, only three days are dedicated to illnesses. This shows the importance of this day. If the United Nations has decided to recognize only three illnesses and if autism is one of them, it means we should really talk about it.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014094">This will not only give these organizations a day for meeting with parliamentarians and senators. It will also give them enough visibility so that people better understand the illness and learn how to help those who suffer from it better integrate into society. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3014095">This illness costs parents from $80,000 to $100,000 annually. That is a tremendous cost. If we have a better understanding of this illness, perhaps more people will have better jobs. I am thinking of mothers who must look after their child and who may want to work part-time. It can also provide tools to employers to help families who have a member suffering from autism better integrate into society. </ParaText><ParaText id="3014096">I would like to explain what the NDP really wants. Establishing an autism awareness day is a good thing. However, people in different parts of Canada do not all have access to the same care. Since health is a provincial jurisdiction, people do not have access to the same care in every province, and health insurance plans do not pay the same amount. This is an issue that should be discussed.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014097">There is also the case of young aboriginal children who suffer from autism. Currently, there is nothing in Canada to tell us what we should do for these young children. Yet that is clearly a federal responsibility, because everything related to aboriginal affairs comes under that jurisdiction.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3014098">We hope that this bill is just a first step and that we can create this day, but we also hope to go further.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014099">I would therefore first like to thank the senator who sent this bill here and the Conservative member who sponsored it; however, I would also like to make them aware of the fact that we should take this a little bit further. When this type of bill is introduced, it is important to determine whether it will improve the overall situation of people with autism.</ParaText>

Specifically, I will follow up on a question I asked in the House following a leaked Health Canada report that suggested that the government may consent to provisions in the CETA that would raise the price of prescription drugs in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014109">I will first reiterate the position of the official opposition New Democrats, which is that we want to encourage trade with Europe. We see in Europe and the European Union an excellent trading partner that comprises many wonderful jurisdictions. Europe comprises mature democracies with mature and progressive economies. In many sectors, our industries are complementary, which means that there are great opportunities for Canadian exporters to tap into the massive European market.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014110">However, the CETA is also raising concerns among Canadians, both because of what they fear is in it and due to the secretive and non-transparent manner in which it is being negotiated. These two issues are illustrated perfectly in the question at hand involving the leaked study from Health Canada. This report concluded that the changes to intellectual property proposed by the European Union and CETA could raise the cost of medication in this country by $2 billion a year.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3014111">Canadians have been voicing their concerns about this for years, since first hearing rumours that the Conservatives were willing to negotiate away access to affordable drugs to get a free trade deal with the E.U. In addition to the leaked Health Canada document, there is a reputable study that concludes that the changes may raise the cost of drugs in Canada by nearly $3 billion. </ParaText><ParaText id="3014112">How has the government responded to these concerns? It has ridiculed them and misled Canadians. The Conservatives have repeatedly been asked to shed light on what they are seeking in the trade agreement with the E.U. In June, government officials testified that they did not have a mandate to make changes that would raise drug costs. The government then put out a so-called fact sheet, calling the idea that CETA would raise drug costs a myth.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014113">If there was no mandate to do this, if the government was not seeking to change the intellectual property regime in Canada, why would Health Canada and Industry Canada take it upon themselves to conduct a study this September on the cost implications of the IP changes in raising prescription drug costs in Canada?</ParaText><ParaText id="3014114"> In a further example of non-transparency, the government has not released the Health Canada study. Just as with the rest of the CETA, Canadians are left to rely on leaked documents. </ParaText><ParaText id="3014115">Transparency is critical to democracy. Honesty is critical to democracy.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3014116">We understand that the actual negotiations must happen behind closed doors, to some extent. However, that does not mean that they cannot have a level of transparency. A government can seek input from Canadians as to what they want out of a trade deal. A government can announce what it will be seeking. A government can also be up front about the possible implications and give regular progress updates to Canadians. That is a transparent approach to negotiating trade deals. This is the approach New Democrats would take to negotiating trade deals. </ParaText><ParaText id="3014117">Trade deals are extremely important in all aspects of Canadian society, and New Democrats know that co-operating and consulting with a wide variety of interests will lead to a better deal. Canada should consult with investors, business leaders, labour leaders, municipalities and stakeholders of all types. There are legal implications, so we need to hear from legal and constitutional experts.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3014118"> In the case at hand, when we are talking about making changes that would raise the cost of drugs, perhaps by billions of dollars a year, we need to consult with those most affected. Businesses pay for drug costs through their employee benefits plans. Provinces are large buyers of prescription medication. Seniors and disabled people, the most vulnerable in our society, are the ones who will bear the brunt of these changes. Yet the government dismisses all of these people and refers to their fears as myths, while studying the very issue they are concerned about.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014119">Will the government come clean with the Canadian people and tell them how much the CETA will cost them?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

In fact Canada's economy proves it, with trade equivalent to over 60% of our GDP and with one in five jobs generated by exports.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014121">Our government understands that helping Canadian businesses expand and succeed abroad directly benefits workers and families by creating jobs and prosperity.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014122">This is more important now than ever. These are challenging, uncertain economic times. Our government has an economic plan to meet these challenges, a plan with deeper trade at its core. We see trade as the new stimulus, an opportunity to create new jobs and prosperity for Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014123">Our negotiations with the EU are a cornerstone of our plan. The EU is already Canada's second most important trading partner, with two-way merchandise trade reaching $92.1 billion last year. </ParaText><ParaText id="3014124">A successful agreement would give Canadian businesses a serious competitive edge in the single largest market in the world. Tariff elimination would make our exports far more price competitive in the EU market. In fact, a comprehensive agreement with the EU is expected to provide a 20% boost to our bilateral trade and a $12 billion boost to Canada's economy. That is the equivalent of a $1,000 increase to the average Canadian family's income, or 80,000 new jobs.</ParaText>

Millions of jobs have been created since Canada and the United States signed the NAFTA. It has given our businesses and workers the kind of access to the U.S. market that other countries can only dream of. We want to create the same benefits for our workers in the EU market.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014127">Despite these facts, the NDP and professional anti-trade activists continue to resurrect the same old, tired arguments.

It talks about the deals that it has signed as if it were crossing off a shopping list. However, let us look at those deals. Generally these deals have been with small economies, and in many cases with partners with whom we should not be dealing, countries like Honduras and Colombia, with disturbing track records on human rights and environmental protection. </ParaText><ParaText id="3014133">What about the Conservatives' record?

Lawrence MacAulay (Cardigan, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3014138">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to stand in my place today, even though the topic is a bit unfortunate. Being born on Prince Edward Island and knowing the fishing community and the importance of the Coast Guard, I want the parliamentary secretary to elaborate on a question I asked in the House on May 18. </ParaText><ParaText id="3014139">On May 18, I indicated that the St. John's and Quebec City Coast Guard stations were closed down. At the same time the government announced that one of the biggest and most important Coast Guard centres in Canada would be closed down. Kitsilano is a very important Coast Guard base. The government also sent out 763 notices to Coast Guard employees, telling them they were no longer required by the Government of Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="3014140">Having lived all of my life among fishermen and along the sea, I am well aware of how important the Coast Guard is. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3014141">Although the issue in Kitsilano is on the other coast, this base responds to hundreds of emergency calls every year. It is located in one of the largest ports. About five million people pass through this port every year. Billions of dollars pass through this port every year. Every year 75 to 100 of the calls that Kitsilano gets are life-threatening. Some of those calls can be from people who are attempting to take their own lives or whatever. The Coast Guard has people prepared to handle these kinds of things. It is just so unfortunate that the likes of this would happen.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014142">The mayor of Vancouver has clearly stated that there could be a high risk of increased fatalities due to the Kitsilano Coast Guard base closure. It is a massive concern for all of those in Vancouver. The City of Vancouver does not have the mandate or the resources. In the meantime, Mayor Robertson has said that the people of Vancouver and across the country should inform their members of Parliament that this is totally unacceptable. I hope that having had a number of people indicate to their members of Parliament how serious this is, I will get an indication from the parliamentary secretary that things will change.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014143">The Coast Guard station in Quebec City has closed down. St. John's has also closed, and it had 500 search and rescue incidents a year. The station covered 900,000 square kilometres and 30,000 kilometres of coastline.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3014144">We are talking about people's lives. It is important to note that a <I>Fifth Estate</I> investigation showed that Canada has one of the worst search and rescue response times in the world. If an emergency happens in the evening or on the weekend, it sometimes takes four times the normal time for search and rescue teams to respond.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014145">I hope when the parliamentary secretary responds to this question he will understand, he will listen to the people of Vancouver and he will take their information. Hopefully he has convinced the government that the Kitsilano Coast Guard base should remain open so that no lives will be lost on the west coast of this country. </ParaText><ParaText id="3014146">Also, I hope the parliamentary secretary will indicate that instead of releasing 763 people from their jobs in the Coast Guard, he will indicate that more well-trained people, as those in the Coast Guard are, will be employed.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Answer" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Kamp" id="7737170"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170848" Type="18">Mr. Randy Kamp (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and for the Asia-Pacific Gateway, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3014147">Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Cardigan for his intervention on this matter. I am sorry to say that he got many of his facts wrong. I do not have the time to correct all of them, but let me comment on the two major issues he raised.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014148">With respect to the reorganization of the Canadian Coast Guard search and rescue resources and the consolidation efforts in St. John's and Quebec City, I have spoken on this several times. I just want to reiterate that our government would not make a change to search and rescue resources that would jeopardize safety.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014149">The consolidation of the marine rescue coordinators into the joint rescue coordination centres in Trenton and Halifax will not change the quality of service provided in coordinating rescues on the water, or the number of resources available to provide response capacity in the waters off Newfoundland and Labrador, and Quebec.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3014150">The decision to consolidate the rescue sub-centres in St. John's and Quebec City with the joint rescue coordination centres in Halifax and Trenton resulted from the Government of Canada's strategic review exercise, which provided us with the opportunity to streamline programs and the way services are delivered to Canadians. It was determined that search and rescue coordination services could be delivered in a more efficient and effective manner, with no impact on service delivery or safety. This process ensures that the tax dollars of hard-working Canadians are used in the most efficient way possible, which Canadians demand of us.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014151">The marine rescue sub-centre in St. John's was successfully consolidated into the joint rescue centre in Halifax earlier this year. Our highly trained coordinators will continue to be available to coordinate rescues on a 24/7 basis. As with St. John's, we will continue to commit to not closing the sub-centre in Quebec and consolidating its responsibilities into the joint rescue coordination centre in Trenton until safety can be assured and we know that we can continue to provide the same level of service in both official languages.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3014152">Regarding the decision to close the Kitsilano station, we know that a safety gap will not be created, as multiple resources will continue to provide search and rescue support. The Coast Guard, the volunteers of the Royal Canadian Marine Search and Rescue, the Canadian Forces and other local responders will all continue to be available to serve the area for maritime distress calls.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014153">In addition to this, a new in-shore rescue boat station will be established in the Vancouver area and will be available to respond to incidents in the busy summer period. As well, the Royal Canadian Marine Search and Rescue will be increasing its response capacity in the Vancouver area.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014154">We also know that the Coast Guard hovercraft at Sea Island has the capacity to support additional search and rescue calls. In 2011, the Sea Island hovercraft spent only 4% of its available time on search and rescue services, including time to and from incidents. Therefore, we certainly think there is more capacity there as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014155">The Coast Guard remains confident that the current level of service will be maintained after the reorganization of resources is complete, and it will continue to effectively support maritime safety in the Vancouver area, as well as the rest of Canada, by coordinating responses to maritime search and rescue incidents using all available resources.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Lawrence MacAulay</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3014156">Mr. Speaker, this idea of downsizing and downloading only creates hardship for people.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014157">The report prepared for the City of Vancouver by the deputy city manager indicates that the Vancouver police officers consider the Kitsilano base to be a significant source of crime prevention and needed enforcement on the water. They rely on support from the Kitsilano Coast Guard base for various call types, as the members of the Vancouver police department are not trained in search and rescue and have no paramedic capabilities. They also support the Coast Guard with search and rescue when they can.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014158">Opposite to what my hon. colleague had to say, the conclusion of this report indicates that the Kitsilano Coast Guard base closure creates a significant gap.</ParaText><ParaText id="3014159">The current activities at the Kitsilano Coast Guard base are within the legislative mandate of the Government of Canada. It is the responsibility of the Government of Canada. As my hon. colleague indicated, the people of Canada and Vancouver want the Kitsilano base left open. I hope my hon. colleague understands that.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We are continuing to provide that network. We believe that when all of the changes are implemented, including the new inshore rescue boat station, the new hovercraft and the new capacity with the Royal Canadian Marine Search and Rescue, we will be able to provide those services in a very effective way.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
