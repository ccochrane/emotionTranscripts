A major fundamental flaw when Bill C-51 was brought in was the fact that there was no parliamentary committee to oversee our security systems. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479586">That is very important because Canadians have expectations that their government will have a balance when it comes to issues such as freedoms, our rights, and security.

All of our allies have oversight committees with an independent chair, a chair that is selected by the committee not by the government.

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Bergen" id="9082628"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="214460" Type="2">Hon. Candice Bergen (Portage—Lisgar, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4479602">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today and join in the debate on Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>, which would establish a national security and intelligence committee of parliamentarians. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479603">I will be sharing my time today with the member for Charlesbourg—Haute-Saint-Charles. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479604">National security has taken on even greater importance over the last number of years. Abroad, we have seen horrific jihadist attacks just months ago, in fact, month after month in countries like France, Belgium, and even the United States.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479605">Right here in Canada, we saw a jihadi inspired attack in October 2014. Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent was killed in Quebec, and Corporal Nathan Cirillo was killed while he was on guard at the National War Memorial, just steps away from where we are standing today. Many of us who served in the last Parliament will recall being locked down, and not knowing what was going on, and we remember that day.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479606">It is important that our national security agencies have the tools they need to do their job, and keep us safe from terrorists. That is why the previous Conservative passed the Anti-terrorism Act in 2015, more commonly known as Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document>. Bill C-51 is good legislation that struck an appropriate balance between protecting national security and protecting the privacy of others. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479607">In fact, the director of CSIS recently told the committee in the other place that CSIS agents have used the powers created under that legislation at least two dozen times. That record speaks volumes.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479608">Today, I am not here to talk about that bill, but I am here to talk about Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>, and how to ensure that the rights and liberties of Canadians are appropriately protected through extensive review and oversight of our national security agencies.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479609">While our men and women in these agencies do excellent work each and every day to keep us safe, it is always important to have a third party watchdog. Currently, national security agencies have a substantial review mechanism. CSIS is reviewed by the Security Intelligence Review Committee, which is composed of former parliamentarians and other prominent Canadians. The Communications Security Establishment is reviewed by the CSE Commissioner, and the RCMP is reviewed by the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479610">However, we note that the Liberals, in their platform, promised that they would “create an all-party committee to monitor and oversee the operations of every government department and agency with national security responsibilities.” Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, depending on how we look at it, that is not the bill that we have before us today. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479611">First, the bill does not provide for any oversight of national security agencies, in fact, the word oversight is not even in the bill. It is nowhere in the description or in the body of the bill. What it provides is a review mechanism for after-the-fact assessment, but it does so with enormous caveats. In fact, there are seven large caveats contained in section 14 of the bill. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479612">These caveats allow the cabinet to deny the committee, a committee of duly-elected parliamentarians sworn to secrecy, the access to any confidence of the Queen's Privy Council, any military operation information, any information on the Investment Canada Act, and any information that may lead in future to criminal charges, among other things.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479613">That pretty well covers off all of the information in the possession of the Canadian Armed Forces, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. That is pretty well all of the information that this so-called committee would need to do the so-called oversight that it is created to do.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479614">Unfortunately, what we have under this legislation is a committee that does not actually have any access to any relevant information. What is more, it is not actually a parliamentary committee. Right here in black and white in subsection 4(3), the bill states that this would not be a committee of Parliament, rather it would be a committee made up of parliamentarians.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479615">What we have right now is a committee made up of parliamentarians with no ability to collect information. We will also learn it has absolutely no teeth to do anything because it cannot report anything outside of the committee, and we have the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and ministers able to cleanse the report before it is brought to Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479616">We kind of have a glorified parliamentary friendship group here, and really nothing more, because the committee cannot review any information. It cannot do anything with the information that it finds because if the Prime Minister deems it is not appropriate for a number of reasons, the Prime Minister or the Prime Minister's Office can change it. Really, this is a pretty hollow shell and nothing more. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="30">(1530)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4479617">I want to speak a bit about the fact that in section 12 parliamentary privilege is eroded by making it clear that a whistleblower could be prosecuted for making any of the information public. Let us think about that for a minute. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479618">The Liberals have said they want this committee to fix the situation where they felt it left the public uninformed and unrepresented on critical issues, but they have established, through this legislation, a system where it would be a crime for a whistleblower to disclose anything from the committee. So, how can there be any access to the information by regular Canadians?</ParaText><ParaText id="4479619">The bill before us does not even come close to meeting the Liberal platform commitments. In fact, it is a bill that further serves to centralize power in the Prime Minister's Office.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479620">Typically, like in the United States and Great Britain, committees of this nature would report directly to the legislative branch rather than to the executive. Yet, in this legislation, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> gets to play middleman between the committee and Parliament.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479621">Under this legislation, it says in subsection 21(1) the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> will receive all annual reports, special reports, and other findings of the committee, so the Prime Minister is going to get everything before Parliament does. He will then have the opportunity to edit and change any report to suit his liking, and subsection 21(5) says that the Prime Minister can refuse to release information at his discretion.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479622">The Liberals have said that this is to protect serious national information and security information, but let us read the text of the bill:</ParaText><ParaText id="4479623"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">If,...the Prime Minister is of the opinion that information in an annual or special report is...injurious to...international relations...the Prime Minister may direct the Committee to submit...a revised version of the annual or special report.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4479624">I want to remind my hon. colleague, the parliamentary secretary, that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> actually can direct the committee to submit a revised report. In this case, it would be if it contravened or hurt international relations. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479625">What does that mean? That means that the Prime Minister and his office could delete or eliminate information that they thought might hurt international relations. From what we have seen recently, does that mean if this report said something that would show that the Chinese are doing something they should not be doing, that the Prime Minister would say not to say anything about the Chinese because we do not want to offend them? Maybe the Prime Minister would be concerned that his vanity project of getting a seat on the UN Security Council might be offended.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479626">With the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> having the motivation, and the naïveté that he seems to be displaying, it is very concerning that this power would be in the Prime Minister's Office to vet this information, and eliminate information that he thinks would not be beneficial to international relations. This is not transparency in any way, shape, or form.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479627"> It is definitely not transparent that several months before this legislation was even tabled, we found out, through the media, that the member for <Affiliation DbId="214297" Type="2">Ottawa South</Affiliation> was given the sweetheart deal as chair of this committee. That in and of itself is very disingenuous. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479628">The government and the Liberals could have at least had respect for Parliament and for its own platform to have withheld that. I do not know why the Liberals felt they had to make that announcement, and do that so quickly unless it had to do with an inside deal that they were concocting. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479629">How can someone become a chair of a committee that has not even been constituted by Parliament in legislation? With a partisan appointment like this, it is clear that the government is not taking the non-partisan goals of this committee seriously. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479630">Let us look at the facts. The <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> and many of the Liberals who have spoken before me have touted that this proposed committee is modelled after the United Kingdom, but the Liberal partisan appointment of the chair is completely different from the U.K. model which allows its committee to elect its own chair. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479631">Second, the committee reports to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, not to Parliament, and the Prime Minister has the ability to omit items and ask for revised reports.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479632">There is more that I could say on this piece of legislation but at the end of the day we are seeing more and more that this is a hollow shell with no substance. This committee will be made up of parliamentarians with no power to do anything, with no power to get information, and with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> vetting all of the information. It looks again like the Liberals want to look like they are fulfilling a campaign promise but they are actually not fulfilling it and they are disrespecting and being disingenuous by doing so.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479633">Unless there are major changes to the bill I cannot support it.</ParaText>

We know, as parliamentarians, that even though we are supposed to keep things quiet, sometimes things leak out. This is probably not a good idea on behalf of the Liberal government, but again, it wanted to fulfill its promise and in doing so realized that it may have created a problem it does not want to have, and that is that very sensitive information is going to be in the hands of parliamentarians. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479636">The Liberals created this problem, and now they are creating more problems. There really is no easy solution to this. They cannot create a committee of parliamentarians that is going to have oversight and real teeth and the ability to oversee something without members having information, but the government is concerned about letting this information out and what is going to happen with it.

I recognize that my hon. colleague in the NDP would support the idea of a committee to oversee CSIS, for example, but it is not workable.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479643">Instead, the Liberals want to look like they have fulfilled their commitment, but then they have realized that they cannot, so they now would create a committee that would have no power to get information and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> would have the ability to vet all information, because I am sure that the Prime Minister's advisers have said to him that we have to be watching over this to make sure that sensitive information cannot get out.</ParaText>

							<ParaText id="4479652"> The Prime Minister's approval is even required for the appointment of senators to the committee, as we see in subclause 5(2), which reads:</ParaText><ParaText id="4479653"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"><B>5(2)</B> A member of the Senate may be appointed to the Committee only after the Prime Minister has consulted with one or more other members of the Senate.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4479654">The words “Prime Minister” come up quite frequently. Even when it comes time for committee members to resign from their duties, they must inform the Prime Minister, as required by subclause 5(5), which reads:</ParaText><ParaText id="4479655"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"><B>5(5) </B>A member may resign by notifying the Prime Minister in writing</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4479656">Since we have a Prime Minister who has the utmost respect for this institution and its elected representatives, what do you think he did? The Prime Minister also retained the right to control who will be appointed as committee chair. That is what it says in subclause 6(1), which reads:</ParaText><ParaText id="4479657"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"><B>6(1)</B> The Governor in Council is to designate the Chair of the Committee from among the members of the Committee, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4479658">One quickly realizes from the way the bill is written that this is the Prime Minister's committee, not a committee of parliamentarians. He chooses who will sit on the committee and who will chair it. It is not a committee of parliamentarians. It is a committee for the Prime Minister so that he can show that the government is taking action on an issue that he has found it difficult to take a clear stand on.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479659">The best response that the government was able to come up with was to create a fully sanitized committee over which the Prime Minister and his office will have complete control.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479660">What is more, the so-called committee of parliamentarians will not report to Parliament as one would expect from its name. It will report, and I hope my colleagues are sitting down for this, to the Prime Minister himself. That is what it says in subclause 21(1), which reads:</ParaText><ParaText id="4479661"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"><B>21(1)</B> Each year the Committee must submit to the Prime Minister a report of the reviews it conducted during the preceding year.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4479662">Subclause 21(2) also confirms that the committee can present a special report to the minister concerned and the Prime Minister.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479663">The work done by the committee of parliamentarians will not be tabled in the House to inform the other members of Parliament, because everything clearly has to go through the central office that controls everything about this committee. Whose office is that? The Prime Minister's.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479664">It is quite disconcerting to read this, but it was written by experts on consultation, transparency, openness, and good governance.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479665">I would like to again quote Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document>, specifically subclause 21(5) on the information that is excluded from the report:</ParaText><ParaText id="4479666"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> If, after consulting the Chair of the Committee, the Prime Minister is of the opinion that information in an annual or special report is information the disclosure of which would be injurious to national security, national defence or international relations or is information that is protected by litigation privilege or solicitor-client privilege or, in civil law,...or the professional secrecy of advocates and notaries, the Prime Minister may direct the Committee to submit to the Prime Minister a revised version of the annual or special report that does not contain that information.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4479667">Consequently, if the Prime Minister does not like the reports received from the committee, he can ask that changes be made to the various reports in order to table a report that suits the government.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479668">Subclause 21(6) refers to the tabling of the report:</ParaText><ParaText id="4479669"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"><B> 21(6)</B> Subject to subsection (4), the Prime Minister must cause to be laid before each House of Parliament, on any of the first 45 days on which that House is sitting after a report is submitted under subsection (1) or (2), a copy of the report or, if the Committee was directed to submit a revised version, a copy of the revised version.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>

In theory, the committee has access to all kinds of sensitive and classified national security information, but the government retains the right to refuse to provide some types of information the committee might request, as stated in subclause 16(1), which reads as follows:</ParaText><ParaText id="4479673"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"><B> Refusal of information</B></QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4479674"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"><B>16(1) </B>The appropriate Minister for a department may refuse to provide information to which the Committee would, but for this section, otherwise be entitled to have access and that is under the control of that department, but only if he or she is of the opinion that</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4479675"><Quote><QuotePara IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2"> (<B>a</B>) the information constitutes special operational information, as defined in subsection 8(1) of the Security of Information Act; and</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4479676"><Quote><QuotePara IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2"> (<B>b</B>) provision of the information would be injurious to national security.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4479677">Refusal of information is final and may not be appealed, as stated in subclause 31(1):</ParaText>

Bill C-22 provides nothing, as indicated in subclause 31(2), which states:</ParaText><ParaText id="4479680"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"><B>31(2)</B> If the Committee is dissatisfied with the determination or the decision, the Committee is not to bring the matter before the courts, but it may note its dissatisfaction in a report referred to in section 21.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4479681">The committee can note its dissatisfaction, but the government could choose to completely ignore the report, for the committee members will be inclined to say nothing, in order to continue sitting on the committee. On top of that, this protest report will never be tabled in the House.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479682">From the way this was presented, the Liberals have a lot of work to do to get the unanimous support of the House. I strongly believe that something like this should have the unanimous support of all members of the House. We are talking about oversight of bodies that are responsible for ensuring the safety and security of Canadians. This is not about partisan politics. Unfortunately, from the way this bill was presented, it appears as though the top of the pyramid wants to make sure it can lead all of the work without any problems. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479683">Let me be very clear: our intention is not to go public with any state secrets or any information that could compromise national security, far from it. We simply want to ensure that the committee is able to have the flexibility and independence needed to properly fulfill its mandate. If we are going to do something, we might as well do it right.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479684">To sum up, what really matters to me is that a committee such as this be founded on trust. It must have the full confidence of all government members and all opposition members, across party lines. With this kind of committee on national security, we need to be working from a place of absolute trust. I will be the first to say it.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479685">Let us listen to our colleagues in the governing party and let us all acknowledge these facts.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The bill would create a committee of parliamentarians to oversee Canada's security agencies. For the first time in history, a multi-party group of members of Parliament and senators would hold Canada's security apparatus to account. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479709">Bill C-22 represents a Liberal initiative that dates back to 2005 in fulfillment of a key part of our campaign commitment to Canadians to reverse the legacy of the old Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document>. I am proud to stand in support of it and the important idea that Canadian security must never come at the expense of our rights and freedoms. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479710">I will start by turning back the clock to early 2015 and the previous government's introduction of Bill C-51. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479711">In my riding of Parkdale—High Park last year, I heard about Bill C-51 over and over again at the doors. Residents in my community in Toronto are smart. They are engaged, and when they sense injustice, they speak out. They told me that they expect better from their government, that ensuring public safety is the preeminent responsibility of any government, but that it is not acceptable to pursue security at any cost. My constituents, and indeed all Canadians, want a government that respects Canadians' rights and one that will put in place mechanisms to protect those rights.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479712">As a human rights and constitutional lawyer, I listened to those residents as a candidate in the past election. I communicated those very valid concerns to my party, and the party responded. In 2015, we committed on the campaign trail that if we were fortunate enough to earn the respect of Canadians and to form government, we would significantly amend that flawed bill and put in place the mechanisms that Canadians want to protect their rights while simultaneously keeping them safe. That is what Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> would start to do. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479713">However, we cannot take all the credit. The idea of ensuring that parliamentary representatives oversee security agencies, like the RCMP, CSIS, and CSE, did not come to us as some sort of epiphany. It is exactly what our allies have been doing for many years. Every single member of the Five Eyes alliance but Canada has some oversight mechanism in place. Those are Australia, United Kingdom, New Zealand, and the United States. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479714">The Auditor General identified the need for parliamentary oversight in a seminal report in 2003. Our party initiated this in 2005 when then public safety minister Anne McLellan introduced Bill C-81. That bill died on the Order Paper when the opposition parties voted down the minority government of then prime minister Paul Martin, triggering the election that brought us Prime Minister Stephen Harper. </ParaText>

							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4479723"> This oversight committee of parliamentarians will have a broad, government-wide mandate to review any national security matter relating to all government security departments and agencies. Committee members will have top security clearance and can demand unprecedented access to classified material.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479724"> The committee is required to report back to Parliament annually, but can do so even more frequently through special reports, if it finds that a special report is required to protect the public interest.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479725"> The committee members are independent. They have the authority to self-initiate reviews of the legislative, regulatory, policy, financial, and administrative framework for national security in Canada. The committee members have tenure. They are appointed until the dissolution of the House. </ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4479726">This committee will not be dominated by government members, because government members will not make up the majority of the committee. Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> specifies that the committee will comprise nine persons, only four of whom may be government members of Parliament. The other five must come from the opposition parties. This is not a rubber stamp; it is actual accountability and oversight of government departments and agencies by a majority of opposition parliamentarians.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479727">Allow me to provide an example. Throughout the extensive debate on the old Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document>, residents of my riding of Parkdale—High Park were very vocal about information sharing among government departments and agencies. Rightly, Canadians said that widespread information sharing may compromise privacy rights. Information sharing is precisely the type of thing this new oversight committee will scrutinize, because it will have a broad government-wide mandate over all national security departments and agencies. This can ensure that when information is shared for intelligence gathering, the rights of Canadians are not being violated or jeopardized. If a violation is identified, the committee can report that to all Canadians through Parliament.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479728">Of course, there may be those who feel this legislation does not go far enough. The important response to those individuals is to note that Bill C-22 contains a mandatory review provision. Every five years, according to law, a committee must study this bill and report back to Parliament on how to strengthen it. In this way, the conversation of Canadians in my riding of Parkdale—High Park and around the country about how to balance security with the protection of rights and freedoms will not stagnate. It will remain dynamic.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479729">This brings me to my third point. We want to hear from Canadians, not just in five years but now. Our government has commenced a Canada-wide consultation on our national security framework. These consultations will allow us to discuss the other campaign commitments we made to remedy the defects of the old Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document>, including entrenching a sunset clause, ensuring that no judge can issue a warrant that violates the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, guaranteeing the constitutional right to engage in advocacy and protest, and narrowing the overly broad definition of what constitutes “terrorist propaganda”.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479730">This national consultation will allow us to hear from Canadians what else they want to see from their government. We do not just want to implement our campaign commitments, but to improve upon them. Throughout this, one thing will always be top of mind, that in seeking to balance security and the protection of rights and freedoms, we will work with Canadian communities, not against them.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479731">Here, I address the House as a Muslim member of the Liberal caucus. The practice of our new government is not to vilify groups or to sow division, but to engage communities and to listen to their concerns. We have done this through our comprehensive efforts to counter Islamophobia. We have done this through our 2016 budgetary commitment of over $35 million over five years to create an office of community outreach and counter-radicalization. We have done this through our efforts to welcome, not shun, the victims of Daesh, which has translated into our accepting nearly 31,000 Syrian refugees to date. We have done this through our efforts today to improve the rights of those who inadvertently find themselves on no-fly lists, by creating a passenger protect inquiries office, and implementing a Canada-U.S. redress working group.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479732">I know that Canadians prefer this approach. It is an approach they voted for in October 2015. It is an approach that seeks to address security concerns on multiple fronts, and one that engenders the confidence of all Canadians, including the very minority groups, like mine, that were disproportionally bearing the brunt of the previous government's surveillance.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479733">I will end with this. It is a fine balance. Ensuring safety while simultaneously protecting rights and freedoms is not easy, but I am confident that Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> will help do just that. I am proud to support this legislation that has been 11 years in the making. At this time, I urge the members opposite to get behind it, rather than standing in our way.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It looks to establish a national security and intelligence committee of parliamentarians.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479751">We know that the committee's mandate, as laid out in the legislation, is to review the legislative, regulatory, policy, administrative, and financial framework for national security and intelligence; any activity carried out by a department that relates to national security or intelligence; or any matter relating to national security or intelligence that a minister refers to the committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479752">I believe that the overall principle of the bill is relevant and necessary, given what we are dealing with in today's reality. However, there is a significant amount of responsibility and understanding, and it requires knowledge and critical thinking on a number of fronts. This is why I find pieces of the legislation somewhat troubling, especially when the act does not require the members of the committee to have any experience in dealing with security or intelligence-related matters and information.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479753">I will frame this up in order to put some context around the issue. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479754">From a personal perspective, and as a former mayor whose city bordered on the United States and is the second-largest border crossing in the country, next to Windsor, Ontario, I have presented before the U.S. Homeland Security on a number of issues. I have presented and also had the largest RCMP detachment in Canada, and I have dealt with significant financial, legislative, and security issues, from the proliferation of gang activity, cross-border drug and firearms issues, and murder investigations to the importation of drugs from China, Mexico, the Middle East, and the list goes on.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479755">I cannot stress this point enough. The people serving on this committee must have some understanding and experience of sensitive, confidential, and secure information as it relates to national security and intelligence.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479756">The bill is about the security of our country and the committee and its processes must be transparent. Regardless of political stripe, we all bring something unique to this discussion and this debate.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479757">The chair should not be appointed. Rather, the chair should be elected. I want to take a moment here, because at this point one of the government member's stated that the critic said, in a letter, that the chair should be appointed. However, I will reiterate point seven of the letter, which is that the committee should elect its own chair from among its members. This is the practice with the U.K. committee and other allied countries. The election of the committee chair was also a commitment made by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. This was a direct notation from the critic to the <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479758">There is no doubt that this is an issue. It is unfortunate that the chair of the committee was already selected and appointed by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> before the mandate of the committee was even established. It undermines the integrity of the committee even before it begins its work.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479759">We need to look at the U.K. model, which was reformed in 2013 to be a committee of Parliament that reported to Parliament, and the members are appointed by Parliament, except for issues of national security, which are reported to the Prime Minister. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479760">The stark difference with Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> is that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> appoints the chair, the members of the committee are recommended by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and the committee reports to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. </ParaText>

Virtually, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> can have any report from the committee rewritten if he does not like the content. I believe the parameters need to be much more prescriptive and narrower in scope.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479764">Openness and transparency is what we all want. We all want to achieve this while still maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive or classified information. The current bill as it stands would not instill confidence in the process or the general public when the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the chair of the committee, whom he appointments, can revise and change the committee's report at will.

However, we need to get it right, because we are talking about the security of this country and its people. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479766">Therefore, I put forward three points. First, the chair of the committee should be elected. Second, the committee should have full powers to summon any witnesses and require them to give or produce evidence that the committee deems necessary to meet its mandate. Third, the committee should submit an annual report to Parliament, but the committee, in consultation with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and their national security adviser, exclude from the report any information that may, if released publicly, jeopardize national security.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479767">I believe that these three points would add a level of transparency, as the committee would be arm's length from the Prime Minister's Office, and instill a level of confidence within the general public. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479768">I believe all members support the concept and the principles and really want to ensure that we get this done right.

While at times the odd vigilante, the lone assassin, or a disaffected group may have posed some threat to a state, these threats were rare and often insubstantial. Consequently, from Roman times until the mid-twentieth century, those responsible for state security were primarily concerned with threats posed by neighbouring states, great powers, and nearby armies. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479785">Taken from this perspective, Canada is geographically fortunate. We are protected by shining seas on three sides, and with the exception of the War of 1812, more than half a century before Confederation, our close friendship with our neighbour to the south has meant that Canada has not truly faced tangible threats to its borders.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479786">However, few would dispute the fact that the security landscape in the 21st century looks very different from any other point in our history. Where we once had vast oceans to separate us from invading armies, modern technology and the alarming growth of violent substate and non-state actors means that Canada's security is faced with new types of threats.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479787">While our country is still a safe and secure place to live, ensuring that it remains so is a much more complex challenge than our predecessors could ever have envisioned. As our country has faced new challenges to our security, new tools have arisen to keep Canadians safe.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479788">In our modern world, intelligence gathering and analysis has become a critical weapon in the fight against terrorism and other national security threats. In a globalized world, where the security threats we face are often shared by our partners and allies, Canada has become a member of a number of intelligence sharing agreements, including the Five Eyes alliance. This group, comprising Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia has been called one of the most comprehensive known intelligence alliances in history. This security alliance consists of some of our closest partners. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479789">The Five Eyes alliance is an excellent example of international co-operation through the sharing of both best practices and intelligence.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479790">Worryingly, however, our partner countries in the Five Eyes alliance, including some of the most formidable intelligence gathering entities in the world, all have placed a safeguard on their intelligence agencies, while Canada has not.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479791">Specifically, Canada is the only member of this alliance without proper oversight of our own intelligence community. While Canada does have a committee on public safety and national security, our partner states long ago realized the necessity of ensuring specific and specialized oversight of intelligence gathering. In fact, the United States formed its permanent committees on intelligence in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal four decades ago, after the Church committee investigated intelligence gathering for illegality of the CIA, NSA, and FBI.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479792">We are so very fortunate in Canada to have dedicated men and women who serve to protect us with great courage and fortitude. We have the opportunity to be proactive to ensure that proper oversight is put in place at a time when our security apparatus is transitioning to a new era. As elected representatives of the people of Canada, we need to be able to oversee our intelligence community to ensure that it continues to act in the best interests of Canadians. Our partner states realized the importance of this long ago. Establishing oversight of the intelligence community here in Canada is something I believe to be long overdue.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479793"> Let me be clear. Calling for oversight does not mean that we lack faith in our intelligence community. For decades we, as parliamentarians, have had oversight over our police forces and our military. This has had nothing to do with their ability to serve Canadians and do their jobs. Oversight is at the heart of our role as parliamentarians. We owe it to our constituents to make sure that government works in the best interests of all Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479794">Ensuring that our intelligence and security agencies do just that is a crucial part of that work. As MPs elected to represent the views, beliefs, and aspirations of our constituents, we must ensure that we balance the need for an effective security apparatus with the duty to uphold the democratic rights of Canadians.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4479795">The creation of this kind of oversight in the form of a dedicated committee was something we pledged in the last election. This government is keeping that promise by proposing here today the development of a committee that would have a wide-ranging mandate and a free hand to review and scrutinize material related to national security. The committee would be able to perform reviews of both national security and intelligence activities, including reviews of matters referred by a minister and strategic and systemic reviews of the legislative regulatory policy, expenditure, and administrative frameworks under which these activities are conducted. The committee would have robust powers to access important information to conduct its review, information not normally accessible by parliamentarians.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479796">This government believes in the importance of consultation, of listening to different opinions and points of view. We are here to serve the people who elected us, to ensure that Canadians are being listened to, and that their best interests are being promoted and protected. This is an integral part of our duty and public service, of which oversight is an important part. This oversight is one of the best ways we can ensure that our intelligence apparatus continues to remain accountable to Canadians. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479797">Accountability is a fundamental aspect of our democracy, and in my opinion, striking a permanent committee to keep our intelligence community accountable is one of the best ways this government can ensure that the organizations meant to protect Canadians and our country are doing their jobs well.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479798">This government also understands that accountability in Canada's security apparatus, and in all areas of government, works best when accompanied by discussions with ordinary Canadians.

There can be no greater obligation than to protect the security of one's citizens, both here and abroad.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479818">The government of a country such as Canada, which cherishes its hard-won freedoms, its democracy, and its rule of law, has another obligation, and that is to uphold the Constitution of Canada and to ensure that all laws uphold the rights and freedoms we enjoy as people living in a free and democratic society.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479819">The need to simultaneously fulfill these two key obligations is at the very heart of the bill before us. This bill is a response to the threats and attacks that have targeted various countries in the world, including Canada and some of our closest allies. Faced with this violence, we must remain alert and never let down our guard.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479820"> In addition, Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> responds to the many calls over many years for enhanced accountability of departments and agencies working in the area of national security. Hon. members will recall that these calls intensified last year when the previous government introduced the Anti-terrorism Act, 2015, also known as Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document>. At that time, our party made the argument that Canada's approach to national security legislation should avoid not only naïveté, but also fearmongering.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479821">The threats are real, and so is the need to protect civil liberties. That is why we included improvements to our national security framework, including the creation of a national security and intelligence committee of parliamentarians, as a major part of our campaign platform in the last election.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479822">The bill before us would establish a committee with nine members. Seven of the committee members would be drawn from the House of Commons, and of these seven, only four can be government members. Two members would be drawn from the other place. This committee will be different from other committees and offices established to review security and intelligence matters.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479823">Under the accountability framework, some review bodies can have access to classified documents, but only for a specific department or organization. The members of these committees are not sitting parliamentarians. Parliamentarians may be involved, but they do not have access to classified documents. Those external review bodies are the Security Intelligence Review Committee, which reviews CSIS, the Office of the Communications Security Establishment Commissioner, and the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the RCMP. None of those bodies include sitting parliamentarians.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479824">On the one hand, parliamentary committees review security and intelligence issues, but they do that primarily by listening to testimony during their public meetings. On the other hand, the Senate Standing Committee on National Security and Defence has a broad mandate to examine legislation and national security and defence issues.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479825"> Moreover, in the House, the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security studies legislation or issues related to Public Safety Canada and the other agencies in the public safety portfolio. They do extremely valuable work, but as a rule, neither of these committees has access to classified information. They have neither the mandate nor the resources to dig deep into the details of national security matters in order to hold the government and national security agencies truly accountable.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479826">Under the bill before us, members of the national security and intelligence committee of parliamentarians would obtain the appropriate level of security clearance and would, therefore, have access to highly classified security and intelligence information regarding national security and intelligence activities across the Government of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479827">I would also point out that our Five Eyes partners have review bodies that function in similar ways. In those countries, select parliamentarians have access to highly sensitive intelligence so that they can help protect the public interest with regard to civil rights while also helping protect public safety by ensuring that national security organizations are functioning effectively.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479828"> Until now, Canada has been alone among the Five Eyes partners in not having a committee where parliamentary representatives can access classified information. This bill would close that gap.</ParaText>

The committee will be able to access any information it needs to conduct its reviews, subject to some specific and reasonable limits. As is the case with similar committees in other countries, while committee members are not in a position to disclose the classified information to which they will have access, they can bring tremendous pressure to bear on a given organization or the government in power by letting Canadians know that something is not right.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479832">Clearly, this new committee represents a major step forward in strengthening the accountability of our national security and intelligence system. It will provide elected officials with a real opportunity to evaluate our national security policies and operations and to ensure that Canadians and their civil liberties are protected.</ParaText>

As a Conservative, I am proud to say our record speaks for itself on those two files.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479848">I also heard from people who were concerned about public safety and national security.

Do not misunderstand me, please, I am not attempting to strike fear into the hearts of Canadians, but I believe it is important that we are not naive about our place in the world.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479850">The most prominent example of this was October 22, 2015, or even most recently in August, when our enforcement agencies stopped an attack. There have been attacks across Europe. We see them in France, Belgium, and Germany, among others, and of course, in the United States. I say all of this because it is important to provide context on what members of the national security and intelligence committee of parliamentarians will have to review.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479851">Our law enforcement, intelligence, and military agencies have played a crucial role in keeping Canadians safe. This bill has legislated a committee of specific design. I think we agree on the essence of it, but there are parts of it that I have issues with, members on the Conservative and NDP benches seem to have the same issues.</ParaText>

The committee will have up to eight additional members of Parliament, to a maximum of four from the government and no more than two from the Senate. Members of the committee cannot be a minister of the crown, minister of state, parliamentary secretary, and are appointed by the Governor in Council on recommendation by the Prime Minister, and the leader of the other members' party.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479853">The committee is intended to be non-partisan and highly independent, but yet, the Liberal government appointed the committee chair in January before the legislation was even created. This committee will review agencies that were highly specialized and effective in their designated fields; yet, there is no requirement that the members of the committee have any experience in public safety and security issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479854">I also find it concerning that the government refused to consult with opposition parties, despite the public willingness by the Conservatives and the NDP to discuss this important committee. In fact, our official opposition critic wrote to the minister twice about this committee. The committee, as it is currently written, is appointed by and reports to the Prime Minister's Office.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479855">I believe, and I think most members on this side believe, that it should be open and reporting to Parliament. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> campaigned on a reduced role of the PMO. We all know actions speak louder than words.</ParaText>

The government in power should not have a veto on what the committee reviews or reports. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479864">As with any committee, the chair provides crucial support and direction to the committee as a whole. It is, therefore, peculiar for a committee of this importance, for a committee that is claimed to be independent and non-partisan, that the government would have already selected who it is going to appoint to this position. We know it is the member for <Affiliation DbId="214297" Type="2">Ottawa South</Affiliation>, and like all of us he is political. I have great respect for the member for Ottawa South. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479865">There are many members in the chamber who I am sure would like to be on that committee, and I have no doubt had there been a free election of the chair, the member probably would have won because he is well respected by members on all sides of the House. However, the government will not even give those members the opportunity to select their chair. What happened to the Liberals' sense of accountability? What happened to their transparency? Real change they said. However, the chair, as I have mentioned, was appointed before the committee was even struck. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479866">There are seven exemptions under section 14 in this legislation, including that the committee cannot look at ongoing investigations that may lead to criminal charges. If I am not mistaken, that basically covers every investigation, and operation of law enforcement and security agencies in this country. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479867">It has been made clear that Canada is not the first country to create this type of oversight committee. Many of our allies have enacted similar oversight systems. This includes the British, the Australians, and New Zealand.

It is, therefore, critical that legislation be properly drafted. As I said earlier, we all agree on the essence of the committee, but there are just some finer points that need to be tuned up in order to appease people on this side of the House. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479870">The committee of parliamentarians should not report to the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> or the government. This is something the Liberals raised many times in the previous Parliament. It is something the Liberals talked about during the election. They said the PMO has too much power, and that power needs to be given back to Parliament. What do we see with this piece of legislation? The Liberal government is no different than any other government before it. It just has the sunny ways title to go with it.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479871">As the legislation stands now, the government will have the ability to vet and veto the decisions made by this committee. This, therefore, would take away all the independence claims that the government has made. In effect, under the current legislation, the committee would be controlled by the Prime Minister's Office, and the Prime Minister's Office has appointed the chair already.

							<ParaText id="4479889">The first, which has been advanced by the official opposition members, is the concept that the architecture of Bill <Document DbId="8364795" Type="3">C-22</Document> undermines the independence of parliamentarians because of the apparent supremacy of the executive branch over the legislative branch. They have cited the various provisions in the act that deal with the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s capacity to appoint the members of the committee under section 5, and the ability of ministers of the crown to withhold information in certain situations under section 16. They have highlighted issues with respect to the ability of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, in consultation with the chair of the committee, to redact certain portions of the proposed report coming from the committee that might be injurious to national security or might disclose information that might be subject to solicitor-client privilege or might be injurious to or impact international relations. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479890">I appreciate this particular point because we do live in a Westminster model, wherein our branches of government, both our executive branch and our legislative branch, are fused into the same body. The supremacy of the executive branch is particularly exacerbated in this type of model, unlike, for example, in the United States, under a congressional model, where there are very clear and separate branches of government, and the executive branch is specifically divorced from the legislative branch.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479891">I would remind my colleagues of a point that was specifically highlighted by the <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness</Affiliation> in his address to the House on the bill. The mandate of this committee is very broad. If we look carefully at the language of the legislation under section 8, it says that the committee's mandate is to review:</ParaText><ParaText id="4479892"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">(a) the legislative, regulatory, policy, administrative and financial framework for national security and intelligence;</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4479893"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2"> (b) any activity carried out by a department that relates to national security or intelligence, unless the appropriate Minister determines that the review would be injurious to national security; and</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4479894"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">(c) any matter relating to national security or intelligence that a minister of the Crown refers to the Committee.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479895">Therefore, the oversight role, the review role, is very broad as set out specifically in the act. However, I would point out that the purpose of this piece of legislation is to do exactly that, to review the broad mandates of our national security and intelligence agencies. It is not to go and delve into the specific operational endeavours of the military or our police services to examine specific matters that are of a specific ongoing operational nature. I would submit that falls within the purview of the government's executive branch, to execute, in real time, responses to potential national security threats and to deal with those instances. The role of the committee is to look at these particularly broad mandates.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479896">Some of the committee's other mandates are to review that our security and intelligence services have the right legislative tools, that the resources appropriated to our national security agencies are appropriate, that we have the appropriate interagency co-operation, and that the legislative framework allows for that appropriate exchange of information. I would also argue that it has to deal with some of the concerns that the third party has advanced, which is to ensure that the appropriate procedural and substantive protections are afforded to individuals who may be impacted by the actions of our security agencies.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4479897"> I believe those are the appropriate measures of review, not the actual review of specific ongoing operational issues. The way I would frame it is that the role of the committee is not to play M in MI6 in a James Bond movie. Its role is to provide oversight and a check on the exercise of executive authority. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479898">The second theme I wanted to address that I think has been overplayed by the opposition is with respect to the ability in terms of both access to information and the ability to redact information. Again, I would invite my colleagues on the opposite side to carefully review the actual language in the bill as it relates to those specific limitations.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479899">Let me take, for example, the provisions that are dealt with under the access to information provisions in clauses 13 and 14, particularly as they relate to the exceptions under section 14. My colleagues on the other side have noted that there are seven exceptions, and they refer to them as being problematic. However, if we examine them carefully, they are very narrowly construed. Basically, they are construed with respect to other rights and immunities and privileges of other classes of persons other than parliamentarians. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479900">Again, I think it is a bit of a mis-characterization that the supremacy of Parliament and the role of parliamentarians somehow supersedes the rights, privileges, and immunities of other classes of persons. I do not think that is a fair characterization. I think we have to always constantly engage and make sure that there is a balance. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479901">We can take a look at the seven specific provisions in section 14. The first one is “a confidence of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada, as defined in subsection 39(2) of the Canada Evidence Act”. In plain English, that means cabinet confidences. The question is whether parliamentarians should be subject and be able to access information as it relates to the deliberations of cabinet. Again, I think not.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479902">The second one refers to “information respecting ongoing defence intelligence activities supporting military operations”. My point is that those are operational decisions. Again, I do not think that it is within the purview of the committee to be reviewing ongoing military action.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479903">The third is “information the disclosure of which is described in subsection 11(1) of the Witness Protection Program Act”. If somebody goes into the witness protection program, I do not think we need to know the identity of who that particular individual is.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479904">The fourth is “the identity of a person who...has been approached to be...a confidential source of information, intelligence or assistance to the Government of Canada”. Therefore, if somebody is prepared to spy on behalf of Canada, again, I do not think we need to have that specific type of information.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479905">The fifth one is “information relating directly to an ongoing investigation”. Again, that is an operational matter. We can certainly look at it retrospectively and review if there was a problem, but I do not think that this committee should be in a position to compromise an ongoing active investigation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479906">The sixth is information related to the Investment Canada Act, and seventh is information relating to the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act. Again, if we look at these particular sections, they are very narrowly construed.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479907">Therefore, the exceptions that are articulated in the bill are very narrow. Again, I would argue that these are very narrow areas that are carved out, and that the mandate of the committee is in fact very broad.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479908">The other point that has been raised is with respect to subclause 21(5), the writing of reports and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister's</Affiliation> capacity to edit the reports.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479909"> Again, I invite my colleagues to read subclause 21(5) carefully with respect to what it means. It does not mean that the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> rewrites the report. It means that a report that has been received by the Prime Minister is reviewed to make sure there is no sensitive confidential information that is then subsequently disclosed to the public. It is this information alone that would be redacted. Through consultation with the chair that information would be subject to review and allowed to be redacted on the basis of national security, on the basis that it might be injurious to international relations, or that the information is confidential because of solicitor-client privilege. </ParaText>

I want to make it clear that we have a lot of criticisms, which I will cover in my speech.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479924">We are willing to support the bill at second reading simply because it is a good first step. The NDP has long believed that we need to create this committee. However, there are some serious problems with the government's approach.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4479925">Before we get into the composition of the committee, I think it is important to point out many of the inconsistencies in the government's approach to this particular file, whenever it comes to proposing anything. We still have not heard, despite the minister's great grocery list in question period yesterday, what the actual plan is. There is no bill before the House, despite a lot of talk, as is becoming far too typical on the part of the government. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479926">Well, there is one bill, the bill from my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="213909" Type="2">Esquimalt—Saanich—Sooke</Affiliation>, which seeks to repeal Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document>. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479927">That said, we are hearing about all these grand plans from the government to bring specific changes, with no actual legislative plan in place.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4479928">The other problem is that we can form committees, create all sorts of mechanisms, but the fact is some already exist. One that springs to mind is the Security Intelligence Review Committee. That committee, which currently exists, reviews the activities of CSIS. The way things stand right now, in light of the budget the government brought down in March 2016 and according to the employees of that very committee, funding is expected to drop by $2.5 million annually. Over the next few years, this will lead to the loss of 11 employees assigned to overseeing CSIS. We can certainly form a committee, but we are definitely starting off on the wrong foot if resources are lacking due to budget cuts. </ParaText>

With all kidding aside, we have been parsing the words. The <Affiliation DbId="214305" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> seems to want us to distinguish between “discussions” and “negotiations”. In this regard, I would like the government to understand the difference between “review” and “oversight”.

							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4479932">After all, the MPs on this committee will swear an oath and be trustworthy. The bill gives the <Affiliation DbId="214300" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> a lot of discretion and that makes me think of the Conservatives' argument when we were debating Bill <Document DbId="6842344" Type="3">C-51</Document> during the last Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479933">The Conservatives argued, or at least strongly implied, that we needed to trust the authorities, that we could not trust parliamentarians to do this type of review, and that independent committees already existed.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479934">I find it downright disturbing because giving cabinet that much power reminds me of the Conservatives' argument.

At the end of the day, we cannot say no to forming this committee because, after all, it is what we wanted. Nonetheless, there are some serious flaws that need to corrected, as I said from the outset.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479936">Clearly, the first flaw is the election of the chair. Ultimately, the chair will ensure that the committee will be independent, which will be difficult if the chair is chosen by the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4479937">As I mentioned in my earlier question, we heard from our cousins from the U.K., when they came here at the invitation of the minister himself last week. They shared with us how important it was in the debate they had when creating a similar committee that the chair be elected. I heard the argument from my Liberal colleague before that this does not matter, because the opposition members will be in the majority on the committee anyway. That is not the issue here. The issue is not about which party is the majority. The issue is not leaving it up to cabinet who is carrying the committee. Parliamentarians from all parties need to have a say. I have no doubt that the Liberal members of the committee will make a wise choice to ensure the independence of the committee, much more independence that when it is coming down from the PMO.</ParaText>

Those two items are closely related and that is the important thing.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479944">To bolster this argument, I will mention the minister's response concerning the government's approach when we asked him about the ministerial directives concerning torture. I am taking this opportunity to officially state in the house that the NDP is calling for the repeal of these directives, because it is completely unacceptable that a country like Canada allows the use of information acquired through torture. The practice does not benefit public safety in the least, and quite frankly, it is immoral and goes against our international commitments.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479945">When we asked the minister the question, he told us not to worry and that the government would establish a committee to deal with such questions and provide oversight.

The bill would not apply to lawful activities such as hunting and fishing.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479994"> The Department of Justice has been clear: this bill applies to criminal abuse, not lawful activities involving animals. However, because letter writers have conveyed to me that they fear the lawful activities of ordinary Canadians could be interpreted as being affected by this bill, we will introduce amendments to clarify that. The NDP wishes to protect the right to hunt, fish, farm, and trap legally, and we will propose amendments to clarify that. Hunters and anglers are vital conservation partners on Vancouver Island, and we need them to be part of the conversation about criminal animal cruelty.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479995">The first part is about shark finning. Despite action by local governments to ban shark finning, Canada still imports several hundred thousand pounds of shark fins every year. This section of the bill would stop the importation of shark fins. </ParaText><ParaText id="4479996">Thanks to the New Democrat member for <Affiliation DbId="214131" Type="2">Port Moody—Coquitlam</Affiliation>, this measure came within five votes of passing in 2013. The only party that stood against it was the Conservative Party, even though 81% of Canadians polled supported a shark fin ban at that time.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479997">One of the most comprehensive studies on shark fisheries was compiled recently at Dalhousie University, in Halifax. In it, scientists estimated that at least 100 million sharks are killed every year around the world. It may be 273 million each year. The study found that shark populations are being depleted faster than they can reproduce. This threatens the stability of marine ecosystems around the world.</ParaText><ParaText id="4479998">The largest culprit is the illegal shark fin harvest, which feeds a growing demand for shark fin soup. Sharks are hooked out of the ocean onto boats and their fins are sliced off while they are still alive. The rest of the shark is discarded into the ocean, where, unable to swim without its fins, it sinks helplessly to the bottom to die. This powerful image was conveyed in the documentary <I>Sharkwater</I>. It was horrific carnage that I will not forget.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4479999">While sharks have survived earth's mass extinctions for over 400 million years, many shark species could be extinct within decades. A major environmental issue associated with shark finning is that the harvest is not specific to gender, size, or species. Therefore, we cannot target harvests to avoid endangered species, as we do with conservation-oriented fisheries.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480000">A further biological complication is that sharks are naturally slow to breed and mature. This makes sharks particularly vulnerable to overfishing, and it makes extinction for many shark species increasingly likely. </ParaText><ParaText id="4480001">This is why extinction would be absolutely terrible. Shark extinctions would significantly alter ocean ecosystems, and they likely already have, because sharks are vitally important apex predators. Like wolves and lions, their terrestrial counterparts, top predators control the population of grazers below them in the food chain. If left unchecked, this can destabilize entire ecosystems.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480002">Specifically, sharks reduce the over-consumption and depletion of plankton by herbivorous fish. This is relevant to the pressing issue of climate change, because plankton are a carbon sink. Plankton absorb carbon, and when plankton die, they sink the carbon to the bottom of the ocean, where it sits. Without sharks, plankton populations will become depleted, meaning more acidic oceans and more carbon in the atmosphere. </ParaText><ParaText id="4480003">Shark extinctions will exacerbate climate change. The health of the oceans, the climate of the planet, and ultimately the survival of our species might depend on sharks. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="45">(1845)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4480004">If by any chance people still believe the myth that sharks are bloodthirsty human eaters and ruthless killers that might harm our species, I will share this compelling stat with them. More people are killed each year by falling vending machines than by shark attacks. I ask members to please come together and support the ban on shark-fin imports for all our sake.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480005">The second part of this bill includes provisions to strengthen and modernize existing animal cruelty offences. These provisions have been advanced by many members of Parliament, including former New Democrat, Peggy Nash. They passed third reading in the House several times, and they were once even approved in the Senate. These changes are needed. For example, a man was acquitted of beating his dog to death by a baseball bat, but he was acquitted because the dog died quickly. As well, willful neglect of domestic animals has been hard to prove. This bill today, instead, proposes a gross negligence offence for failing to provide adequate care, where an individual is found to have departed markedly from a standard of care that a reasonable person would use.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480006">Finally, in this bill, the courts would be allowed to impose a lifetime ownership ban on repeat offenders of animal cruelty. Ninety-two per cent of Canadians polled support updating the Criminal Code to make it easier to secure convictions for animal cruelty offences. I hope parliamentarians will stand with these people.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480007">The final part of the bill proposes to ban the sale of cat and dog fur, and also to require source labelling of fur. This would match the laws in the U.S. and the European Union. A 2012 <I>Toronto Star</I> investigation revealed that cat and dog fur is used in children's toys, boots, and in trim on coats. Three NDP MPs have previously attempted the measures contained in this bill to ban the sale of that fur and to require source labelling for cat and dog fur.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480008">In conclusion, I want to say again that this bill is not about hunting and fishing. If it were, I would not support it. This is about animal abuse, not animal use. The bill applies to criminal abuse, not to lawful activities involving animals. My riding is built on commercial fisheries. It is full of hunters and anglers doing vital preservation work, and our riding is very dependent on recreational and sport fisheries. Because I do not want anyone to fear that lawful activities like those would ever be affected by this bill, there is an amendment we would propose in committee to clarify that this would not affect lawful hunting and fishing.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480009">Finally, Robert Brodgesell of Ladysmith reminded me of Gandhi's words: “The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated”. I urge Parliament to vote together and show leadership to end animal cruelty in Canada.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

That was Mahatma Gandhi. His words, uttered over half a century ago, remain as relevant today as ever. I say that because the last time animal cruelty laws were substantially changed in Canada was 1892. That was the first year Lord Stanley's cup was competed for by hockey teams in the Dominion. That was 124 years ago. Legislative change in this area is long overdue.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480012">I applaud the member for <Affiliation DbId="214185" Type="2">Beaches—East York</Affiliation> for introducing legislation that would help bring Canada's animal protection laws into the 20th century.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480013">Before I even read Bill <Document DbId="8122718" Type="4">C-246</Document>, I heard about it from the engaged residents of my riding of Parkdale—High Park by mail, by phone, through email. I am moved by the passion and dedication of my constituents, people like Ms. Barbi Lazarus and Mr. Kirti Shah, from the Toronto Vegetarian Association. They have been advocating for fair animal treatment practices in our community and around the country for years. Mr. Shah shares the same faith as my wife, Jainism, a religion that teaches about non-violence and respect for all living things. They understand that the kinds of practices Bill C-246 would prohibit have no place in Canadian society.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480014">However, I did not simply hear from adult advocates. In my riding, I also heard from youth. On a visit to the class of Mr. Davis Mirza, at Keele Street Junior Public School, I heard from Grades 5 and 6 students about their concerns. They were shocked to learn how long it had been since changes were made to Canada's laws respecting animals. They demanded that we, as parliamentarians, do better to ensure our laws reflect the values of all Canadians, including our young people who care deeply about animal welfare. </ParaText><ParaText id="4480015">I have listened to the concerns of my constituents, and I am committed to doing better by supporting this important bill, which I seconded on May 9 of this year. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480016">However, it is not just the people in Parkdale—High Park who are concerned about animal welfare. Canadians across the country and across the political spectrum care deeply about this issue. A key indicator of this are a few facts: 5,630 people have signed e-petition 509 in support of Bill <Document DbId="8122718" Type="4">C-246</Document>; 13,000 Canadians signed e-petition 123 relating to the use of cat and dog fur; and on change.org, 48,000 signatures were collected in support of the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480017">Let us turn to the bill. Bill C-246 addresses issues that I consider, to be frank, largely uncontroversial. </ParaText><ParaText id="4480018">First, it would ban the sale of cat and dog fur in Canada. It would require labelling that shows the source of all fur. Amazingly, in our country we do not have labelling requirements for animal fur garments. As I have learned through the advocacy of residents in my community, like Josie Candito, a tireless champion of animal rights in Parkdale—High Park, cat and dog fur is used for trim on coats, the lining in children's boots, and the exterior of toys. This is all permitted to occur because we do not have the necessary prohibitions in place. Bill C-246 would change this. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480019">Second, Bill <Document DbId="8122718" Type="4">C-246</Document> would ban the importation of shark fins. I venture to guess that most Canadians are unaware of what shark finning actually involves. Let me explain it briefly. Shark finning is the practice of catching a shark, cutting off its fin, and simply discarding the remainder of the shark's body back into the ocean. The still live, finless shark is completely unable to swim, sinks to the bottom of the ocean, and drowns. This heinous practice has been illegal in Canada since 1994, but the importation of shark fins continues unabated. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="55">(1855)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4480020">In 2015 alone, 318,000 pounds of shark fins were imported into Canada. Municipalities such as Calgary and Toronto banned the importation of shark fins, but their bans were overturned in court because they were not under municipal jurisdiction. The Court ruled that only the federal government has the power to impose such a ban. Clearly, this is Parliament's cue to take action. </ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4480021">This brings me to my third point in relation to the bill. Bill <Document DbId="8122718" Type="4">C-246</Document> also answers the Supreme Court's call for clarity on the issue of bestiality. Allow me to explain. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480022"> In the case of D.L.W., our Supreme Court acquitted a man accused of bestiality where the sexual conduct involved a dog and the man's teenager stepdaughter. Because the act in question involved a disturbing act of oral sex and not physical penetration, the Supreme Court of Canada overturned the man's conviction.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480023">In his majority ruling, Justice Cromwell said:</ParaText><ParaText id="4480024"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The term bestiality has a well-established legal meaning and refers to sexual intercourse between a human and an animal.... It is manifestly not the role of the courts to expand that definition. Any expansion of criminal liability for this offence is within Parliament's exclusive domain.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4480025">As can be imagined, the public response to this decision was incredulous, not because of the judge's interpretation—Justice Cromwell was simply applying the law—but because the actual definition of bestiality was so narrow. We do not need to be lawyers, we just need to apply some common sense to recognize that the bestiality prohibition ought to prevent all sexual acts with animals as exploitative. Whether penetration occurs or not is not the issue and should not be determinative.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480026">That is exactly what this bill will address, a legal void. It will expand the definition of bestiality, as the Supreme Court invited this Parliament to do to cover all “sexual activity between a person and an animal”. This will improve on an important goal, preventing the sexual exploitation of animals in all of its forms, a goal that I am confident all members of the House believe in pursuing.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480027">Fourth, I would like to address some misunderstandings about this bill. Bill <Document DbId="8122718" Type="4">C-246</Document> is geared towards preventing animal abuse. It does not affect or prohibit legitimate animal use. Therefore, in the latter category, the rights of anglers and hunters are not compromised by this bill, nor are the rights of livestock farmers.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480028">Concerns about the impact of this bill on legal, accepted practices is unfounded. Allow me to explain. To contemplate a situation where police, conservation officers, and prosecutors across this country would somehow investigate and begin charging and prosecuting hunters, anglers, or farmers engaged in well-accepted animal practices is simply not credible. As a former crown counsel who practised law for 14 years, I know firsthand that police and prosecutors are far too preoccupied with serious criminals to use their precious, limited resources to chase after our important farmers or law-abiding anglers and hunters. Legitimate, well-accepted animal use practices are not the target of this legislation. The target is animal abuse.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480029"> Let me provide some examples. Dog fighting, for instance, is not simply a foreign problem. It has reared its ugly head recently in Tilbury East Township in Ontario, where they seized 31 pit bull-type dogs in a case involving 5 different individuals.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480030">Another example of animal abuse is puppy mills. One such mill was discovered in Windsor this past June. A total of 14 dogs were found in the possession of a single woman, and the dogs' physical condition had seriously deteriorated. One of the dogs, a Shih Tzu, was found with six pounds of dried feces attached to its long, matted fur. Those are the types of abuse targeted by this bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480031"> The proposed amendments in this legislation to the animal cruelty provisions of the Criminal Code would facilitate prosecutions of animal abusers, moving the criminal standard from “willful neglect” to “gross” or severe “negligence”. In addition, this bill will close some of the loopholes that currently exist regarding animal fighting, and those who benefit economically from it. This includes criminalizing receiving money for fighting animals, and breeding, training or transporting an animal in order to fight another animal.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480032">The fifth point that I want to make is that Bill <Document DbId="8122718" Type="4">C-246</Document> is based on sound evidence. There are numerous studies and journal articles demonstrating that animal abuse is often a precursor to later, more serious criminal activity, including domestic violence. So there is an important public interest in enacting legislation that targets animal abuse, and works to deter such behaviour. This observation was made in previous submissions and speeches on this legislation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480033"> By enacting Bill C-246, Parliament can deter animal abuse, which will have the derivative effect of helping to address some of the root causes of violent crime in this country, including violence against women.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480034"> I would urge members to get behind Bill <Document DbId="8122718" Type="4">C-246</Document> not simply because it is based on sound evidence, but also because it is ethically sound. To circle back to the quote from Gandhi I mentioned at the outset:</ParaText><ParaText id="4480035"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4480036">This observation rings true, because more so than any other un-empowered group, animals are truly voiceless. They cannot advocate for themselves. By definition they require others to take up their cause. In 2016, some 124 years since the last significant change to the animal cruelty provisions in the Criminal Code, I believe its high time we took up that call as parliamentarians. That is why I am supporting this bill.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

All the livestock farmers I know have pets, dogs, and I was no different. Nobody has more respect for animals than those people. </ParaText><ParaText id="4480039">I am speaking not just for myself as a parliamentarian and not just for the farmers in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="214417" Type="2">Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound</Affiliation>, but for farmers everywhere, and also people who hunt, fish, and trap. This is a bill that has them very concerned.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480040">Bill <Document DbId="8122718" Type="4">C-246</Document> is a reiteration of several other pieces of similar legislation that have come before the House over the years. Having been a member of Parliament since 2004, I can say that I have seen some variation of the bill in almost every Parliament I have been a part of. It has been voted down every single time due to concerns that it goes too far and endangers legitimate animal use. I will express these same concerns here today.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480041">The riding I represent is a rural riding. It is home to a lot of farmers, hunters, anglers, and trappers. For the constituents of <Affiliation DbId="214417" Type="2">Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound</Affiliation>, animal use has always been a vital part of their everyday life. For this reason I will be speaking against the passage of Bill <Document DbId="8122718" Type="4">C-246</Document> at second reading, as I feel that it would endanger the livelihoods of the many residents of <Affiliation DbId="214417" Type="2">Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound</Affiliation> and across Canada, and possibly put an end to the number of farming, hunting, angling, and trapping traditions across Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480042">I will start by stating that I am fully supportive of legislation and initiatives that seek to promote better welfare for animals and I am in full support of harsher penalties for those who are wilfully and intentionally cruel to animals. Those who are knowingly cruel to animals should face the full force of the law. Nobody is disputing that, and anybody who opposes the bill does not dispute that aspect of it. In fact, in the last Parliament I was pleased to vote in favour of Quanto's law, which was a piece of legislation that enhanced legal protection for service animals of police agencies and the Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480043">Furthermore, I note that the bill contains provisions surrounding shark finning, which again, I am opposed to, but shark finning has been illegal in Canada since 1994. We should not even be talking about it. There is no need. It is illegal already. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480044">Overall Canada has very good animal welfare legislation at both the provincial and federal levels, but I am always open to discussing potential problem areas to ensure that animal welfare is upheld. These are not the measures with which I have great concerns. </ParaText><ParaText id="4480045">When it comes to Bill <Document DbId="8122718" Type="4">C-246</Document>, I am concerned with four specific sections of the bill. The first is a section of the bill that moves the provision in the Criminal Code surrounding animal cruelty out of the section dealing with offences against certain property and into the section dealing with offences against persons. This could be the start of a very dangerous trend. Essentially, moving animal cruelty provisions from that section of the Criminal Code to this section of the Criminal Code begins to suggest that animals are entitled to the full rights of human beings and have the right to be represented in court. I find this deeply troubling, as it could be the beginning of the end of hunting, farming, angling, and trapping.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480046">To put this in perspective, it does not mean we do not respect animals, but if I had to choose between one of my family, like one of my grandkids and my dog, in terms of rights, I think there is only one obvious way I would choose. I hope I never have to do so, but the bill could do that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480047">Furthermore, Bill <Document DbId="8122718" Type="4">C-246</Document> contains a number of new provisions that redefine what constitutes criminal activities against animals, the first of which is the inclusion of a recklessness test that would be included alongside the wilful test. What this means is that wilfully causing harm or suffering to an animal has always been illegal, but the bill would add a new host of actions that would fall under the test of recklessly causing harm or suffering.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="05">(1905)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4480048">The problem here is that what constitutes recklessness is not clearly defined. Would hitting an animal with a car constitute reckless harm or suffering? We have all hit animals, or most of us have, if we drive in rural Canada. Would hitting an animal cause reckless harm or suffering? I do not think so. It is not intentional, but accidents happen.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480049">These are the loopholes that make the bill so dangerous. I would not want to see anyone slapped with a criminal record for hitting a racoon, deer, or whatever with a car. </ParaText><ParaText id="4480050">My greatest concern is the following provision, which I will read. Under proposed subsection 182.1(1) it says: </ParaText><ParaText id="4480051"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> Everyone commits an offence who, wilfully or recklessly,...(b) kills an animal or, being the owner, permits an animal to be killed, brutally or viciously, regardless of whether the animal dies immediately;</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480052">This opens up a very serious can of worms that would result in the criminalization of farming, hunting, angling, and trapping in Canada. The words “brutally” and “viciously” are used here to describe what could constitute an offence against animals under the Criminal Code. A major problem here is that there is no definition of what is meant by brutally or viciously. Furthermore, these terms are completely brand new to any sort of legislation related to animal cruelty in Canada, the U.K., Australia, and the U.S. </ParaText><ParaText id="4480053">Further still, no Canadian court has every interpreted this language, so we do not know how this will play out once this legislation comes into force. I have heard from a great number of constituents and stakeholder groups that this has the potential to criminalize any sort of animal use in Canada. The language is simply too vague. It is unacceptable.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480054">For example, the group PETA states that animals are not ours to kill, eat, wear, experiment on, or exploit for entertainment. It would seem as though PETA would certainly claim that slaughtering cattle for beef production would constitute a brutal or vicious act against animals. There goes our agriculture industry.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480055"> PETA would most certainly state that shooting a deer, moose, or turkey would be a brutal or vicious act against animals. There goes recreational hunting in Canada. A fish with a lure in its mouth: gone is the recreational fishery. A muskrat or beaver in a trap: there goes our trapping and fur trade.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480056">I think members see the point I am trying to make. Because the provisions in the bill are so open to interpretation, and because the interpretations are so wide-sweeping, we could see the end of many different traditions and practices related to animal use in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480057">While I do not think it was the intent of the sponsor of the bill to criminalize these activities, it is most certainly a major problem with the legislation. Furthermore, a simple solution would have been to clearly state a list of activities that are exempt from the provisions in the legislation. This list should include ranching, farming, hunting, fishing, trapping, and medical research. This would ensure that these legal activities would not result in the handing out of criminal records for otherwise lawful activities.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480058">Finally, I want to discuss a host of proposed changes that have been sent to me by the sponsor and that many stakeholders have been talking about. I appreciate the efforts made by the sponsor to enhance the bill and respond to concerns from the farming, hunting, angling, and trapping communities. However, there is no guarantee that these amendments will be proposed and adopted by the committee. </ParaText><ParaText id="4480059">Therefore, at second reading, I cannot support the bill as currently drafted. I took some interest in what my colleague, the <Affiliation DbId="214673" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice</Affiliation>, said when he spoke to the bill in the first hour of second reading. He stated that,</ParaText><ParaText id="4480060"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> Animal cruelty is an important social issue that deserves a comprehensive legislative response. It needs broad public consultation to allow us to get this right. The best way forward is in the review of the Criminal Code that will take place in the future. This way we can hear and attempt to address the concerns of Canadians engaged in legitimate activities of hunting, fishing, ranching, medical research, etc. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4480061">While I do not always agree with my hon. colleague on all issues, on this issue he has hit the nail right on the head. We need to consult with those who have expressed concerns about the bill so that we can ensure that we protect animal welfare in Canada in a way that does not criminalize traditions that rely on animal use.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480062">In closing, I would like to say to the member that I truly appreciate that he tried to fix this after the fact, but he could have drafted the bill with the right kind of consultation in advance. I would be happy to work with him on something like that, and there are probably other members in my caucus who would work with him, but we just cannot support it the way it is.</ParaText>

It deals with three rather loosely related issues: animal cruelty, the importation of dog and cat fur, and shark finning.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480064">I have received a lot of feedback on this bill from constituents, most of it in favour of the bill because it seeks to strengthen animal cruelty law, but I have also heard serious concern from outdoor enthusiasts who felt that the bill might have inadvertently caught up hunting, fishing, and trapping in the web of animal cruelty provisions.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480065">I have had meetings with three hunters' groups in my riding who expressed this concern clearly. I assured them then and I assure them again that this is certainly not the case and if it were, I could not support it. That said, I would be happy if the committee would explore amendments that would make that crystal clear, and perhaps list the legal activities that would be excluded, as the previous member stated. This is really about criminal cruelty, not legal hunting, fishing, trapping, or agriculture. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480066">I would like to spend the rest of my time talking about the third issue dealt with in this bill, and that is shark finning. Finning is the practice of removing fins from live sharks on board fishing boats, and tossing the big animals overboard, where they die a cruel death. In that sense, finning might belong in this bill about animal cruelty, but it is really the impact on shark populations, and how that changes our ocean ecosystems that I think is a deeper concern.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480067">Many Canadians might not know how widespread, important, and diverse sharks are in Canadian waters. There are 28 species of sharks off of our shores, most of them large predators. Some are at the top of the food chain, and play a key role in shaping our marine ecosystems. Like many large predators, they are slow growing, slow to mature, and slow to reproduce. These are all features that make their populations very sensitive to overharvest, especially the overharvest of adults.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480068">Sharks have been suffering serious population declines in recent decades for a variety of reasons. Of the 245 species of sharks in the world, 65, more than a quarter, are on the red list compiled by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. They are at some real risk of extinction. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480069">The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada, COSEWIC, has assessed six species of Canadian sharks and listed three as endangered, and three as species of special concern. The two main causes of population declines are fisheries bycatch and shark finning. These two issues are related since many sharks caught in other fisheries, such as the longline fisheries for tuna and swordfish, are routinely finned and tossed back.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480070">Estimates of the numbers of sharks finned each year are difficult to calculate, but all estimates are mind-bogglingly high. A 100 million is the standard answer, but some estimates are over twice that. This practice is changing our oceans forever. Can anyone imagine 100 million bears disappearing from our forests each year, and what that would do to our ecosystems, or what about the loss of 100 million lions from the plains of Africa?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480071">Some species are particularly hard hit by finning. The scalloped hammerhead has declined by over 90%, one study suggesting the loss of 98%, over a period of 30 years off the east coast of North America. Data from the same coast indicates that the population of oceanic whitetip sharks, once one of the most abundant large animal species in the world's oceans, declined by over 70% between 1992 and 2000. That is 70% in only eight years. This species is rapidly becoming functionally extinct, so I heartily support this bill, and its effort to curb the trade in shark fins. It is a good first step, an essential first step, but Canada could and should be doing more on both the national and international stages to make an impact here.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480072">The government has made a lot of effort to get the message out that Canada is back on the world environmental scene, but we are sorely lagging in many aspects of global environmental action. For example, we could be co-operating with other nations in the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, which have been calling for meaningful bycatch limits for sharks during the tuna fishery, but both Canada and Japan have been dragging their feet on this issue. </ParaText><ParaText id="4480073">We could take the bold step to promote the listing of all shark species in appendix II of CITES, so that the international trade in shark fins can be better regulated.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="15">(1915)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4480074">In our own backyard, Canada needs to reinvest in fishery science and monitoring. Setting regulations about bycatch, and creating laws about shark finning will accomplish little if there is not a significant government presence on our coasts to actually witness what is happening to our oceans.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480075">We could put more emphasis on science, when government receives listing recommendations from COSEWIC. COSEWIC makes annual recommendations on species to add to the species at risk schedules, and government then decides whether to act or not. Bird species are almost always added as a matter of course, but fish species have only a 50-50 chance of being listed because economics often trumps the science of endangerment. We must rebalance this policy to ensure that our ocean ecosystems remain healthy into the future.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480076">I reiterate that I will support the bill. It is about criminal acts of cruelty, not legal hunting, fishing and trapping, agriculture. I support it both for its strengthening of the animal cruelty law, and for its steps to support the conservation of sharks.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

They work on a collaborative basis to enhance codes or practices on our farms. They also adhere to core values, such as accepting the use of farm animals in agriculture, believing that animals should be treated humanely, and supporting projects that are scientifically informed. That is the way we work to improve animal welfare in Canada. Unfortunately, Bill <Document DbId="8122718" Type="4">C-246</Document> could undo the good work of those organizations by unfairly targeting them through the legal system.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480106">We have been told that this bill will be modified at committee to address the many concerns that have been raised, which I have only barely scratched the surface of here today. This presupposes the outcome of the committee hearing. As members know, committees are their own masters. To modify the substance of the bill, the unanimous consent of the chamber is required. We have seen that this is not achievable.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480107">Procedurally, a bill at committee cannot simply be redrawn. Amendments may be proposed by members, but it is up to the committee to adopt or reject them. Significant changes are not in order, and the chair of the committee and the Speaker of the House have a responsibility, a duty deeply established in parliamentary convention, to rule as out of order any changes that are beyond the scope of a bill.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480108"> To get a bill to committee, the House must agree with it in principle. To change it, the committee must keep it within that principle.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480109">For me to vote for this bill at second reading, I must agree with the text as it is written in principle. I do not believe that hunters, fishermen, trappers, farmers, homesteaders, and others working with animals belong in prison. I do not agree with the bill in principle. I hope that my colleagues will have the wisdom and the foresight to reject the bill, to kill it without further pain or suffering.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="25">(1925)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Zimmer" id="9084221"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="214450" Type="2">Mr. Bob Zimmer (Prince George—Peace River—Northern Rockies, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4480110">Mr. Speaker, my colleague across the way and I have a lot in common. As co-chair of the parliamentary outdoor caucus, I share that role with a Liberal from Newfoundland and Labrador. Sometimes these issues cross party lines and we are supportive of one another across the aisle as well. </ParaText><ParaText id="4480111">I have three concerns with this bill. First, it would potentially criminalize traditional practices of hunting, trapping, angling and fishing, and farming. Second, it would change the definition of animals from property to people. Third, we already have extensive animal rights protection laws in Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="4480112">I will start with the first.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480113"> I think most of us have gone fishing with parents or family, and likewise hunting. A lot of us in this place have backgrounds in farming and agriculture, and have raised cattle to be harvested for hamburgers, steak, or whatever. Certainly, as was mentioned by my colleague on this side of the House, the last people who would want to be cruel to an animal are members of the groups that know those animals and see them every day, like farmers, hunters, fishermen, and anglers. To potentially put these groups of individuals into a place where they could be accused of being criminal is too far-reaching for us.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480114"> A key change in what the bill proposes is the new kill an animal offence. Proposed subsection 182.1(1) states: </ParaText><ParaText id="4480115"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Everyone commits an offence who, wilfully or recklessly...</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4480116"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">kills an animal or, being the owner, permits an animal to be killed, brutally or viciously, regardless of whether the animal dies immediately;</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4480117"><Quote><QuotePara IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">kills an animal without lawful excuse...</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480118">The concern are the words “brutally or viciously”. For this chamber of 330-plus individuals, brutally and viciously have different definitions and different meanings. For one, brutally and viciously is understood as something that is inhumane, that affects an animal in a negative way without concern for the animal's sensibilities.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480119"> However, another meaning could be considered for the common practices of even catching a fish for instance, where once people catch a fish, they have to end its life so it can be consumed and eaten as a filet for supper. That could be deemed to be brutally or viciously killing. That is my concern. We have groups of people that have traditionally fished, hunted, and trapped, etc.. They would now be potentially accused of treating animals brutally or viciously. I know the member who put this bill forward said that would not be the case, but the potential for that definition to be taken far and wide is what concerns a lot of us in this place.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480120">I will speak to the second point as well, about the changing in definition from property to people. The change is significant because it would take animal cruelty offences out of the section dealing with offences against certain property and would move it to the section of the Criminal Code dealing with offences against persons. That distinction is very important because instead of involving property, we would have potential offences against human-type individuals, which certainly would put it into a different level in the Criminal Code than I think most of us would consider acceptable.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480121">Again, I want to get to the premise of Bill <Document DbId="8122718" Type="4">C-246</Document>. On this side we, and I know many on that side too, do not want to see cruelty to animals. I have a family pet. We have had family pets in the past and we cherish them as members of our family. However, to hold them as members of the family equitable to the human beings in our family is going too far, and I agree with my colleague who said that earlier.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="30">(1930)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4480122">Last, we already have extensive legislation that deals with animal cruelty in Canada. To say that we need more legislation to make sure that this does not happen is just not necessary.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480123">I thought it was interesting that one of the members who said they were going to support this particular bill talked about a certain case of animal cruelty. I think it was dogs that the member said were abused. They were emaciated and down to a fraction of what their healthy weight should be. They were acknowledged as being abused and it was dealt with in the system. The owner was charged and the case went before the courts.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480124"> That is an example of the current laws in this place working. It already functions well in dealing with animal abuse and cruelty. We do not need more laws on the books to go even further.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480125">I will go a bit more into what our current laws are, because I think people out there who are watching us tonight may not know and may think that we need laws. Therefore, I will state the laws that we actually do have, or part of them.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480126">The offence is in part 11 of the Criminal Code entitled “Wilful and Forbidden Acts in Respect of Certain Property”. These are current laws on the books.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480127">Section 445.1 states:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480128"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Every one commits an offence who</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4480129"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">(a) wilfully causes or, being the owner, wilfully permits to be caused unnecessary pain, suffering or injury to an animal or a bird;</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4480130">That is fairly comprehensive in dealing with animal abuse in my mind. Other subsections are more specific. Section 445 prohibits “wilfully and without lawful excuse...kills, maims, wounds, poisons or injures dogs, birds or animals”. </ParaText><ParaText id="4480131">Section 446, “Causing damage or injury”, states that one commits a crime who:</ParaText><ParaText id="4480132"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">(a) by wilful neglect causes damage or injury to animals or birds while they are being driven or conveyed; or </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4480133"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">(b) being the owner or the person having the custody or control of a domestic animal or a bird or an animal or a bird wild by nature that is in captivity, abandons it in distress or wilfully neglects or fails to provide suitable and adequate food, water, shelter and care for it. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4480134">Those are just a few parts of the laws that are already on the books to deal with animal cruelty, although I applaud the member.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480135">Shark finning is another one of those practices that is already on the books that cannot be done in Canada legally. If one is caught doing it, one will be charged. Those are laws that are already on the books currently today.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480136">As co-chair of the parliamentary outdoor caucus, I have really learned to appreciate this part of our Canadian heritage. Our forefathers started this place. Hunting and sustenance fishing were part of what we did, and farming as well. It was all part of our tradition, and not just that, it was necessary for our survival. Therefore, to now come in with legislation that would potentially criminalize that historical activity unnecessarily, to us, is an overreach. </ParaText><ParaText id="4480137">Again, I have gotten to know a lot of these folks who would be captured up in this type of legislation, me included, because I fish and hunt. We cannot ask for a bigger group who wants to help the conservation efforts in Canada proceed. Ducks Unlimited and many other groups are supportive of conservation. They do tireless work to see that animals are healthy and that they have places to grow and prosper. To affect this group of really good, well-meaning folks with possible charges of criminal activity, again, goes further than we want to go.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480138">Again, I applaud the member for his intention. As I said, my family appreciates our pets. We had an English Bulldog, but lost our dog a year ago. When it died, it impacted our family. We care about animals, too, but we just think that Bill <Document DbId="8122718" Type="4">C-246</Document> goes too far.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480139">Likewise, I will be standing with my colleague on the Liberal side, from Newfoundland and Labrador, my co-chair in the parliamentary outdoor caucus, and we will both be opposing the bill. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="35">(1935)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Erskine-Smith" id="9084244"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="214185" Type="2">Mr. Nathaniel Erskine-Smith (Beaches—East York, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4480140">Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Canadians across the country for caring about, for speaking up for those without a voice, and for standing up for improved animal protections.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480141">My colleagues have been inundated with correspondence in support of Bill <Document DbId="8122718" Type="4">C-246</Document>. I want in particular to thank Ruby's Love Letter Legacy, an organization that came together to stop puppy mills, and Animal Cruelty Legislation Advocates Canada, both grassroots organizations working to improve our animal protection laws.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480142">When I introduced this legislation, I said that members from all parties support ending animal cruelty. I do not think this is a partisan issue and I do not think it should be. I would stand alongside farmers, like my in-laws, who would disown me, by the way, if I did anything to animals. I stand alongside farmers, fishermen, and anglers against animal cruelty. As any number of colleagues here today have said, this is about ending animal abuse, not ending animal use. </ParaText><ParaText id="4480143">When I introduced the bill I said the bill would bring our laws into the 21st century. I overstated the case. This is a basket of modest measures, all things considered, to improve our animal protection laws.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480144">There has been a ton of confusion about the bill giving animals' rights, the right not to be tortured and abused, if we want to call those rights.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480145">What would the bill do? The bill would do three things, and we have touched on some of them.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480146">Let me speak first about shark finning. Some folks in the House have said that shark finning is already illegal so we do not have to worry about shark finning. <I>The Globe and Mail</I> reported that last year over 300,000 pounds of shark fins were imported into the country. When they are tested they are commonly found to be from endangered species. </ParaText><ParaText id="4480147">Other countries have bans on the importation of shark fins. Ten states in the U.S. have bans on the trade of shark fins. When we look at Australia, there is actually an international norm, a landed shark requirement. The terrible practice is when the shark's fin is cut off and the body is wasted at sea. So, what do countries do? They require that the shark be landed intact and then be finned. </ParaText><ParaText id="4480148">If amendments are required, I am perfectly open to that idea. We in the House should stand against the practice of shark finning and against importing shark fins into Canada.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480149">Let me speak about fur labelling and banning the sale and importation of cat and dog fur. I do not know who could stand in favour of importing and selling cat and dog fur. There have been numerous petitions in the House against the practice. It has been banned in the EU and the U.S. for years. Why Canada would lag in this area is beyond me. The EU and the U.S. require fur labelling. Big companies in Canada already do this. A Canada Goose jacket comes from coyote. Why all companies should not be subject to this practice as a matter of consumer choice is beyond me.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480150">Now, with regard to animal cruelty in the Criminal Code, I have been accused of drafting this legislation in a wrong-headed way. This legislation was drafted in 1999 by the justice department, so ignore my opinion. Instead, take the opinion of the justice department that drafted it, take the opinion of the hon. Anne McLellan, take the opinion of the hon. Martin Cauchon, take the opinion of the hon. Irwin Cotler, all of whom had proposed identical legislation. If you do not trust them, take the opinion of the Cattlemen's Association and the Dairy Farmers of Canada, who in 2004, among many other animal use organizations, wrote a letter to the hon. Irwin Cotler to ask for this legislation to be passed. What legislation? The identical legislation that is before the House with respect to these Criminal Code amendments.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480151">Now, I recognize that we are over a decade later. People do not have the institutional memory. People are worried about this legislation. I listened, I consulted, I met with more agricultural sector groups in my tiny office. I am not the ministry of anything. We consulted broadly over the spring and summer. We heard concerns. Some people said they are political concerns and not policy concerns. I did not particularly care. I am pragmatic enough to know I want something to pass. I want to improve our animal protection laws.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480152"> So, I proposed amendments. I proposed amendments to limit the Criminal Code to three specific things: amending the bestiality provisions to address the Supreme Court case; expanding the definition of animal fighting, because no one is going to complain about criminalizing profiting off of animal fighting, breeding, or training animals for the purpose of fighting; and limiting the Criminal Code amendments, the third piece, to gross negligence. Why? Because every standard across the Criminal Code with respect to negligence is a gross negligence offence, a marked departure from the norm. Why would animal cruelty be any different, but right now it is. It is the only standard in the Criminal Code that is willful neglect. </ParaText><ParaText id="4480153">That is it. It is just these three changes.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480154">As far as the process goes, our job in the House is to support legislation if the object of the legislation is something that we can support at second reading. Guess what? If the changes are not made a committee, and I will be the first to propose changes when I address the committee, the bill will come back to us at third reading and we can vote it down. If these changes are not made, I encourage all members to vote it down. If members do not vote in favour of it at second reading, I encourage them to tell their constituents that they do not care about the object of the bill, which is to end animal cruelty.</ParaText>

I had asked the <Affiliation DbId="214329" Type="4">Minister of National Revenue</Affiliation> a question about the infamous Bahamas Papers, the leaked documents from the Bahamas. </ParaText><ParaText id="4480167">We learned that Senator Eaton was very surprised to see her name listed as a director on the board of a company set up as an equity firm in the Bahamas. She was surprised because she had no idea that that was the case.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480168">This raises two serious problems regarding certain countries considered tax havens, including the Bahamas. The first is the extremely strict bank secrecy. The second is the secrecy regarding the information related to businesses set up as equity firms in those countries. </ParaText><ParaText id="4480169">It is extremely difficult to obtain any information on the bank records or any records identifying the directors of companies set up as equity firms in those countries.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480170"> I had asked the minister a question about the famous tax information exchange agreements that Canada has signed. We have signed 21 since 2008, if my memory serves me well. These agreements are supposed to give us greater access to this information. We are given the impression that, with these agreements, we can just ask the tax authorities of those countries for information about Canadian citizens who are supposedly hiding their money or who might use the tax system of those countries for tax evasion or aggressive tax avoidance. The problem is that these agreements do not facilitate any exchange of information, far from it.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480171">What is interesting is that these agreements have gained popularity since the OECD established a grey list of tax havens. It created a template for this type of agreement that was supposed to put an end to the secrecy of banks and even the excessive secrecy of corporations. In order to be taken off the list, a country had to sign these agreements.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480172">That was not too difficult. The Cayman Islands, which were on this list, signed 18 agreements in two years. In general these were agreements the country signed with other tax havens so it would eventually be taken off the list. This shows just how meaningless these agreements are. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480173">As I said, Canada has signed 21 agreements so far. Are we talking about agreements concluded with the United States or with European countries, such as France or Germany? No, these agreements were concluded with Anguilla, the Netherlands Antilles, our first treaty, Aruba, the Bahamas, Bahrain, Bermuda, Brunei, and so forth.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480174">Most of these countries are considered tax havens. Canada continues to sign agreements that are utterly ineffective, so much so that when there is a leak like the Bahamas papers, some people are listed as directors without their knowledge.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480175">What I wanted to know when I asked my question, which was not answered to my satisfaction, was whether the Canadian government was going to review the effectiveness of its agreements. Unfortunately, the minister simply responded by reading the notes she usually reads. She talked about the famous $444 million that will eventually be invested, but that does not in any way answer the serious question I asked.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

These matters all have to do with international tax evasion or avoidance. </ParaText><ParaText id="4480178">My colleague spoke about various treaties that seek to prevent double taxation. To give him a specific answer, I want to tell him about what the Canada Revenue Agency is doing to combat aggressive international tax avoidance and tax evasion. My colleague spoke about the unprecedented investment of $444 million. The CRA is using that funding to acquire the tools it needs to crack down on tax fraud.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480179">The government is also working with international partners by participating in joint efforts and sharing intelligence so that it can go after tax cheats. In addition, the agency is using that additional funding to escalate and better target its activities to ensure compliance with tax laws, and it will report to Canadians on its progress frequently and transparently. These actions will benefit the middle class and ensure that Canada has a fair tax system.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4480180">This new funding, which we announced last spring, will enable the CRA to hire additional tax experts for a five-year period to scrutinize multinational corporations that use tax avoidance structures and to conduct audits of wealthy, high-risk individuals. The new staff will include not only auditors, but also economists, lawyers, and other experts. The CRA will therefore have highly qualified individuals with the diverse range of skills needed to go after complicated schemes designed to escape detection.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480181">The CRA will also tackle more files by using sophisticated business information, as well as the expertise of experts from various disciplines.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480182">In addition, the CRA recently created three other audit teams to focus on large corporations, and it will create additional teams next year. The minister recently signed the multilateral agreement concluded by the appropriate authorities on country-by-country reporting, which compels multinational corporations to report their global banking activities. This international effort allows tax authorities to follow financial transactions all around the globe.</ParaText><ParaText id="4480183">In closing, the CRA is currently conducting 750 audits and 20 criminal investigations focused on individuals who own property abroad. Those are just some of the actions the Canada Revenue Agency is taking to combat tax evasion and international tax avoidance.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
