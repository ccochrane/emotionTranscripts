We have learned through leaks from CTV's Ottawa bureau that, first, Roger's colleagues believe he had the best BS detector on the Hill. Second, no matter how busy, Roger would sneak out of the office for a 45-minute workout; his colleagues loved that. Third, on his last day of work, he left a note for the CTV team that said, “Work space for rent.

This is a proud moment for the British government, which kept its promise to meet the United Nations goal, despite internal opposition and very tough economic times. </ParaText><ParaText id="3246473">The UN target to commit 0.7% of GDP to international aid was a pledge put forward by Canada's very own Lester Pearson and is a very integral part of our reaching our millennium development goals. However, the Conservative government is far from the goal, with our percentage falling closer to 0.2% after drastic cuts in last year's omnibus budget. </ParaText><ParaText id="3246474">Looking to tomorrow's budget, we hope that the government will be reinvesting funds for life-saving development aid and join the United Kingdom as a leader on the world stage in our long-lasting commitment to the world's poorest of poor. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

In Canada alone, the Keystone and other pipeline projects will mean at least 905,000 new jobs by 2035. It also means $1.3 trillion of economic output and $281 billion in tax revenue.

By science, we mean all forms of intellectual endeavour whereby truth is sought.</ParaText><ParaText id="3246768">Our motion has three main points. The first is for all MPs to support the basic principle that federal scientists must be enabled to openly discuss their findings with the public. Second is also a fundamental principle that public science, basic research and the free and open exchange of scientific information are essential to evidence-based policy-making. The third point is a specific request that the federal government maintain support for basic scientific capacity across Canada, including immediately extending funding to the world-renowned Experimental Lakes Area research facility.</ParaText><ParaText id="3246769">To begin I will talk about our first principle, which we are asking the House to vote in support of tonight. This concerns allowing scientists to discuss their findings, a practice that sits at the very heart of what for centuries has been called the scientific method.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3246770">Science is not test tubes or data sets or microscopes or space stations, but a method by which we explore and attempt to explain our world. Central to the scientific method is the public disclosure of data and test results. This is crucial as it allows others to replicate research and retest and re-examine how and why scientists reached their conclusions. Without a strict adherence to the scientific method, we do not generate science but mere propaganda.</ParaText><ParaText id="3246771"> Our motion asks that the House recognize that we in this place support a critical component of the scientific method, namely that researchers employed by the Canadian government not be restricted in their ability to share their work.</ParaText><ParaText id="3246772">I was shocked to recently discover that during an interview on #FAQMP, the <Affiliation DbId="139897" Type="4">Minister of State (Science and Technology)</Affiliation> actually bragged about getting daily briefings to ascertain whether “some scientist leaked information to another country”. Is this what we have come to? Does the government live in such fear of our top researchers that it requires daily briefings as to whether our scientists are traitors? We ask government members to vote “yes” to our motion to prove otherwise.</ParaText><ParaText id="3246773">The second point concerns public science for Canadians. Our second principle concerns ensuring government policy is based on the best available research, and that this research is made available to the public.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3246774">Canadians support science through their tax dollars. However, by suppressing the results of public research, Conservatives either seem to think that Canadian taxpayers are incapable of understanding the science being done on their behalf or think it is too dangerous to allow them to be informed and make decisions for themselves.</ParaText><ParaText id="3246775">I would also like to mention at this point that I will be splitting my time.</ParaText><ParaText id="3246776">Despite their disdain for science, hopefully the members on the government side of the House can see how important it is that our policies, including those connected to the economy and the environment, be based on solid evidence and not ideology. It is hard for scientists to take comfort in platitudes from members opposite. They hear the same talking points about how the Conservative government values scientific research.</ParaText><ParaText id="3246777">Canadian scientists know full well that the voices of their colleagues are being silenced. Canadian scientists know that our international partners are now choosing not to collaborate with us because they question the integrity of Canadian science and fear government interference with their work. Canadian scientists also know that promising young students are being turned away because funding for scholarships and research labs is being drastically cut. Canadian scientists know that labs across Canada must now scramble to secure emergency funding and finding none, wait for an eleventh hour pardon for the crime of believing that furthering knowledge is worthy of their life's effort.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3246778">Finally, our NDP opposition day motion calls on the Conservatives to concretely demonstrate their commitment to discovery by ensuring long-term stable funding for basic research, starting with the extension of funds to the Experimental Lakes Area. In the grand scheme of things, the few hundred thousand dollars it takes to keep the ELA open is a pittance, both in real numbers, when compared to many other government schemes and policies, and in relative terms, recognizing how much Canadians and indeed the whole world has benefited from the work being done there.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="30">(1530)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3246779">To quote our outgoing environment commissioner, Scott Vaughan: </ParaText><ParaText id="3246780"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">—this is something that doesn't exist elsewhere and also it's been under way now for a couple of decades.

That is right. Instead of being used to solve questions such as the effect of silver nanoparticles on the environment, the forests around the lakes are likely to be logged bare.</ParaText><ParaText id="3246782">Let us not forget that what is happening to the ELA is happening in research facilities right across Canada. The ELA is just one cruel symbol among many of the Conservative science policy.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3246783">While I am sure the <Affiliation DbId="139897" Type="4">Minister of State (Science and Technology)</Affiliation> will stand and say that his government has invested more than any other, in fact, that is not true. The most recent Statistics Canada report shows that last year the Conservatives cut 6% from science and technology funding and laid off 1,500 personnel engaged in science and technology activities. Canada committed 1.8% of our gross domestic product to research and development in 2010, down from our 2.1% commitment in 2001. Our southern neighbours under President Obama now spend 3% of GDP on research and development, and other developed countries spend up to 4.5%. </ParaText><ParaText id="3246784">The Conservatives' cuts to science have hit hard primary funding agencies such as SSHRC, NSERC and CIHR. They have forced many labs and research institutes to close and forced promising early-career researchers to move abroad for research opportunities.</ParaText><ParaText id="3246785">A letter of concern signed by University of Ottawa professor David Bryce and 46 other top scientists on the moratorium on NSERC's major resources support program said:</ParaText><ParaText id="3246786"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">There are now no funding streams dedicated to the purchase of scientific equipment or to operate nationally and internationally unique resources.

One cannot expect that Canada will be in the position to lead the global push for innovation in the 21st century on one hand, but then on the other, ruthlessly slash the scientific research capacity from which innovation stems. One cannot expect that the voices of Canadian scientists will be the ones that inspire the world, but still choose to muzzle many and cast over all the fear of retribution.</ParaText><ParaText id="3246789">The innate human drive of curiosity is a powerful and beautiful thing, but that which leads us to world-changing discoveries is first contingent upon our freedom and capacity to innovate. That freedom, that capacity, is being taken away by the Conservative government. </ParaText><ParaText id="3246790">Canadian scientists need the freedom to speak freely and have their work judged not by political loyalty tests but by their peers in the field. Ensuring scientific capacity is strong means stable, sustainable funding for basic research and ensuring the next generation of Canadian scientists receive the support they need.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3246791">The NDP believes in scientific research and though it may take decades to reverse the effects of these short-sighted Conservative cuts, Canada will climb out from these new Dark Ages.

Then after those conversations, they may be 90% sure or perhaps 0% sure because someone shot down their idea. That 90% then becomes 95% and people keep talking. That is how scientific ideas are tested, hardened and refined.</ParaText><ParaText id="3246799">I do not know if the government properly appreciates the importance of communication and of trying out ideas that one is not quite sure about, which might be wrong or embarrassing, or the effect of having media handlers follow scientists around at scientific conferences.

In 2010, its scientists published 524 peer-reviewed journal articles.

Open information is about proactively releasing information on government activities to Canadians on an ongoing basis. Open dialogue is about giving Canadians in an online community a stronger say in the development of government policies and so on.</ParaText><ParaText id="3246890">Through this initiative, the federal government launched its open data portal, a one-stop shop for federal government data that can be downloaded free of charge by Canadian citizens, researchers, voluntary organizations, private sector business, and the list goes on and on.

This department is in constant need of more science dollars for the survival of our many economically important fisheries throughout the country and for the survival of our oceans, lakes and rivers. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3246959">However, rather than ensure proper science funding for DFO, the Conservative government has slashed funding for many of its important research stations. These stations include the Institute of Ocean Sciences, the Freshwater Institute, the Kluane Lake Research Station, the Maurice Lamontagne Institute, the Gulf Fisheries Centre, the Bedford Institute of Oceanography, the St. Andrews Biological Station and the Experimental Lakes Area, one of the most important research areas in the country. This is only for DFO. Many more harmful scientific cuts have been made in other federal departments and programs. </ParaText><ParaText id="3246960">The closure I want to focus on, and the one that I believe is perhaps the best example of the government's shameful attack on science, is the Experimental Lakes Area, or the ELA. </ParaText><ParaText id="3246961">The ELA is one of the world's most renowned facilities for freshwater research. It is one of a kind and has produced a lot of critical information and policy over the last 40 years. Last spring, the government announced that it would be ending the operation of the ELA. Later the government stated that it would try to find a new operator by March 31, 2013.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3246962">This facility is located in northwestern Ontario. It includes 58 small lakes and is managed through a joint agreement between the Canadian and Ontario governments. It is truly a living natural laboratory for freshwater research, and it is the only place in Canada where whole-lake ecosystem research can take place. In fact, it is the only place in the world where this type of research can take place.</ParaText><ParaText id="3246963">The ELA has been critical in developing evidence-based environmental policy, regulations and legislation, including regulations to control phosphorus in the Great Lakes. ELA research led to Canada becoming the first country to ban phosphorus from laundry detergents. Other research led to legislation to curb acid rain production and demonstrated that reducing mercury emissions from burning fossil fuels will rapidly lower mercury levels in fish. Ongoing research evaluates nitrogen removal from municipal waste water and the effects many household products could have on our freshwater. </ParaText><ParaText id="3246964">Information produced at the ELA is also used by researchers across the country and around the world to investigate how climate change will affect Canada's aquatic resources. Research at the ELA also provides the scientific evidence required to manage commercial and recreational fisheries.</ParaText><ParaText id="3246965"> The fact that we can now conduct responsible monitoring in the oil sands is a direct result of invaluable research done at the ELA.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3246966">First nations chiefs in Ontario and Manitoba have called upon the Conservative government to reverse its decision to terminate the ELA. Four former regional director generals of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans have spoken out against this closure. Liberal members of Parliament have been actively fighting the closure and are working with the Coalition to Save ELA.</ParaText><ParaText id="3246967">Last October I introduced a motion for the fisheries committee to study the ELA, the research done at the facility, its impacts on public policy and the potential consequences of closing, remediating or transferring the ELA to a third party. I know that my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170334" Type="2">Etobicoke North</Affiliation> did the same in the environment committee. </ParaText><ParaText id="3246968">The ELA costs the federal government $2 million or less to operate per year. In fact, we are hearing that the ELA could keep going for as little as $600,000. However, closing the facility entirely could cost up to $50 million. The government is now saying that the cost of closing the facility could be as low as $8 million, but we well know that it is going to be a lot of millions. Either way, it seems that the priorities of the government are severely misguided. For the cost of shutting down the ELA, the government could keep it open, and Canadians, in fact the entire world, could benefit from its research for years to come, perhaps even decades to come. However, the government would rather close up shop than keep this scientific research alive. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3246969">In fact, even though March 31 of this year was the date given for the government to find a new operator, we now know that the destruction of the buildings on the site has already begun. It was also reported that scientists have been told to remove their belongings in preparation for the demolition of the site. There were rumours that the International Institute for Sustainable Development, the IISD, the Winnipeg-based United Nations think tank, was the only group known to be discussing the possible takeover of the facility. The IISD was not aware of the destruction that was taking place at the ELA. This brings into serious doubt that the government is sincere that it will actually transfer the facility to a new operator.</ParaText><ParaText id="3246970"> It is certainly my fear, and the fear of all members on this side of the House, that it is not its intention at all. It is my fear that the research produced by the ELA does not go along with the government's agenda, and it has decided to shut it down, no matter what it costs. Canadians will be the ones who bear the cost of the closure of this facility, not only for the millions of dollars it would take to shut the facility down and clean up the site but also for the loss of all the possible research and policy the ELA could have produced for decades into the future.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3246971">For a country like ours, where nature is such an iconic symbol, to lose one of our most important natural research facilities is beyond belief. It is a black eye on the country, along with many other policies of the government. It has severely damaged our reputation on the international stage. The government repeatedly says that it is closing the ELA because it no longer fits the core mandate of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. I find this excuse completely unacceptable. </ParaText><ParaText id="3246972">I hope that government members will look at what is, in fact, taking place: the destruction of the scientific community across Canada, the muzzling of scientists, and their making sure that we do not have the best possible scientific advice to put policy in place for this country. Again, I urge government members across the way to take a look at this, support this very important motion and save the scientific work that is so important for fisheries and other aspects across this country.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The current ecological and economic crisis is a reminder that Canada needs to invest in public science and basic research and freely distribute scientific data. Climate change is real, and we are already suffering from its effects. We are at a crossroads, and we need science now more than ever.</ParaText><ParaText id="3246991">Need I remind hon. members that, just 40 years ago, our industries were polluting the St. Lawrence River, we were burning toxic waste and miners were dying of cancer because they did not have the information and protection they needed?</ParaText><ParaText id="3246992">We have come a long way since then. We set up research institutes, cleaned up our lakes and rivers and decontaminated thousands of sites across the country, but there is still a lot of work to be done. Today, we are paying for the mistakes of the past.</ParaText><ParaText id="3246993">Right now, the situation in Canada is of grave concern. This Conservative government is undoing all the progress that we have made over the past decades. By making cuts to scientific research, censoring scientists, abolishing our environmental laws and destroying world-renowned research institutes, such as the NRTEE, the government is setting us back 50 years.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3246994">The experimental lakes program is a very good example. For 40 years now, the research conducted on 58 lakes has allowed us to make extraordinary advances in the field of biology that are recognized throughout the world. For example, this research has helped us to better understand the blue-green algae phenomenon and the role of phosphates in the development of cyanobacteria. This research has helped to improve water quality in many of our lakes. And that is not all. The research on these lakes in their natural state has helped to advance scientific studies at the international level. This is the only laboratory of its kind in the world.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3246995">Yet the Conservatives do not really seem to understand the importance of this institution. Their decision to do away with the experimental lakes program is a monumental mistake. The government is saying that it will save $2 million by closing this site, yet it costs only $6,000 to operate and replacing it or getting a private institution to run it would cost several million dollars.</ParaText><ParaText id="3246996">What is more, the Conservatives are not considering the cost of depriving our country of data that are essential to preserving the quality of our water. The Conservatives seem to think that this is no big deal, that we will stick future generations with the bill and that they will deal with the problem. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3246997">In addition, this week we learned that Fisheries and Oceans Canada had locked up the Experimental Lakes Area cabins and was preventing scientists from accessing the site. Yet Ottawa had announced that it would continue managing the site until next September, but that it would not be paying for any research after March 31.</ParaText><ParaText id="3246998">For months the government has been saying that it is looking for a private sector organization to take over the program, but nothing has happened yet. Britt Hall, a biochemist at the University of Regina and the director of the Coalition to Save ELA, is worried that 44 years' worth of data will be lost and that experiments will be cancelled.</ParaText><ParaText id="3246999">Researchers at Trent University in Peterborough had to stop their work.

It will be impossible for them to finish their research.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247000">Cuts at the PEARL atmospheric research station in Nunavut also demonstrate this government's lack of a long-term vision. This winter, researchers were not able to gather data. It is important to continue funding research in areas as vital as climate change.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3247001">The list of this government's strategic errors is long: cuts to experimental farms and Mont-Joli's Maurice Lamontagne Institute, abolishing Statistics Canada's long form census, cuts to fishery research, cuts at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, at the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada's major resources support program, and so on.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247002">Thanks to documents obtained under the Access to Information Act, we recently learned that there is concern amongst Environment Canada scientists who are responsible for monitoring air quality. Many of them work in offices in Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Edmonton and Vancouver, ensuring that we are complying with laws limiting land and atmospheric pollution.

The three key players in scientific research—universities, the private sector and the government—all play a fundamental role. The government funds research through programs, institutions and tax credits. Therefore, why eliminate these incentives in science and continue to offer tax breaks to oil companies? That is a double standard.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247005">Public research cannot always be replaced by the private sector. Take Statistics Canada's consumer price index, for instance. Only the government can measure it, and companies really need that information.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247006">Yves Gingras, a professor who is the Canada Research Chair in history and sociology of science at UQAM, said:</ParaText><ParaText id="3247007"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">People often say the Conservatives are opposed to science.

							<ParaText id="3247008">It is troubling to see that these cuts to science are accompanied by drastic changes in environmental legislation. With Bill <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document>, the Conservative government drastically modified the environmental assessment process for hydrocarbons. Consultations were reduced to a minimum, almost to nothing, in fact. With Bill <Document DbId="5754371" Type="3">C-45</Document>, it took away all protection for our lakes and rivers.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247009">All of this is accompanied by a culture of secrecy and censorship that has been imposed by the Conservative government since 2006. The prestigious Royal Society of Canada, an institution that has been around for more than 100 years and whose members are scientists in all fields, wrote an open letter to condemn the Conservatives' attitude. The Royal Society of Canada made a very simple request, namely, that the government stop preventing scientists from announcing their discoveries to the Canadian public. It is a fairly basic request. In a democratic society, it is important to discuss what action to take based on fact rather than simply being guided by ideology.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3247010">For instance, the census is one of the tools that enabled Canada to become one of the most developed countries in the world. It is one way for the government to develop targeted, effective public policies. For instance, it tells us what the average age is in a given area, which helps public health authorities target their actions. It guides entrepreneurs who are looking for opportunities, by mapping out the average income in a given region. It also helps community organizations that want to reach out to a specific clientele.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247011">Let us talk about the status of French, since today is the International Day of La Francophonie. The status of French in Canada is another example that proves how useful the census can be. The data collected made it possible to accurately follow major linguistic trends, thereby allowing governments to adapt their policies in order to ensure the vitality of the French language. Unfortunately, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> could not care less. He has decided to put his own ideological interests ahead of the country's interests.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247012">For a government that claims to care about important issues like economic development, public health, the environment and the status of French, its attitude—tossing aside all scientific data and muzzling scientists—is not very responsible.</ParaText>

We will continue to advocate for complete freedom for all Canadian researchers and an end to this censorship.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247014">I hope the Conservatives will put their shoulders to the wheel and support this important motion, so that our scientists can restore their image, regain their zeal and continue to participate in the essential research that Canada so desperately needs.

It was a wonderful experience to submit to the rigour of scientific inquiry.

These studies provide the opportunity to see the world in a different light. </ParaText>

In my opinion, Parliament is a place for debate where we ask ourselves questions and look for the best solutions to the important issues brought before us. Parliament Hill and the public service employees who serve Canadians exist to help parliamentarians find the answers they need so that the laws introduced in the House of Commons are based on facts, evidence and probative data from Statistics Canada or scientific research.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247038">Public research is interesting. As my colleague said earlier, research and development is carried out by universities and industries, and also by the government. That is called public research. In Canada, for a number of decades, we have been interested in various subjects. We are a Nordic country, with a particular climate. Thus, we are interested in meteorological data. In fact, Canada began establishing meteorological stations in the mid-1800s and even earlier.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3247039">These data have been collected over the years and allow us to see daily weather trends. Meteorological data allow us to see if it is time for farmers to plant or, later in the year, to harvest, or if we should be wearing a winter coat or a raincoat. When these meteorological data are collected over a number of years, they also reveal climate trends.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247040">It is the same for environmental data.

							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3247041">The beauty of public scientific research is that it provides the data needed to track trends. That is what the Experimental Lakes Area did. Since 1968, when this program was established, the region has served as a living laboratory to answer our questions about, say, lakes that were dead. What was the cause? What would fix the problem? The ELA allowed us—and will allow us, if the government wakes up and realizes the need to continue—to collect essential data. It is very important for us as parliamentarians and Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247042">I would also like to point out that while I was in Vancouver, I was one of the only parliamentarians who attended the American Association for the Advancement of Science conference. I had the opportunity to meet with science professionals who denounced the muzzling of scientists, which we have already talked about. I spoke about my studies and the importance of being able to debate issues and how to address them.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247043">Then, last spring, I participated in a protest against muzzling scientists. It was very exciting to see a number of scientists rise up during the protest to denounce this.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3247335">Mr. Speaker, on November 22, I asked the <Affiliation DbId="170678" Type="4">Minister of National Revenue</Affiliation>, Prince Edward Island's representative at the cabinet table, to explain the reasons her department decided that it is in the best interests of Canadians to have the document centre located in Borden-Carleton privatized.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247336">The concern I raised is that privatizing the record centre, ending the relationship with the Government of Canada, which has direct control over these critical, important and private documents, could, in fact, create a problem in terms of security.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247337">The termination of the Borden-Carleton centre with the Government of Canada is part of the government's attack on front-line services that are critical to Canadians, an attack that has most severely targeted Atlantic Canada as a region, and an attack by the government that is felt in every province and in a growing number of Atlantic communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247338">What the minister from P.E.I. has done is ensure that more than 70 positions will be eliminated or replaced somewhere with minimum wage jobs by workers with no affiliation with the Government of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247339">The submissions made to CRA by Canadians often consist of documents of a highly sensitive and personal nature. Most importantly, they could be medical records. When I asked the minister to explain her actions, which will risk sensitive documents, including medical records, the minister declared that “we do not keep medical records”.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3247340">Actually, Canadians must submit documents on a regular basis for tax and benefits purposes. CRA files, in fact, do contain medical records. The minister was wrong. The minister confirmed that the purpose of the privatization of the Borden-Carleton facility was to do records management at a lower cost.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247341">How low will the Conservative government go? Is it willing to privatize to a facility paying minimum wage? Is the minister from P.E.I. willing to allow the private sector to move records off Prince Edward Island, away from the island, with the loss of those jobs as well? Does the minister not realize that paying decent wages and benefits lessens the risk to the security of the system? Citizens' records are important. To put records at risk is just not sensible.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247342">On February 2, 2013, in response to a letter I sent to the <Affiliation DbId="170678" Type="4">Minister of National Revenue</Affiliation>, the minister stated that her officials had consulted the Privacy Commissioner and Justice Canada with respect to the control of these sensitive documents.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247343">What is interesting is that the Office of the Privacy Commissioner has acknowledged that on December 12 it would be making a decision. However, according to the Union of Taxation Employees, which had called for an investigation by the Privacy Commissioner, that investigation, as of today, has not been concluded.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3247344">The question remains: Why has the government taken this action to privatize or close this facility?

Of course, our top priority is the economy, which includes meeting the needs of Canadians while making sure that tax dollars are spent wisely. Re-engineering the way we manage paper records to a records management service provider will ensure the privacy and security of taxpayers' records and will do so at a lower cost to Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247346">Also let me clarify that the benefit programs directorate within the Canada Revenue Agency does not keep medical records. Certainly as a former medical health care practitioner, there is a significant difference. We do have documents that contain limited information related to an applicant's eligibility determination for the disability tax credit. Let me assure the hon. member that the privacy and security of taxpayer information is always our foremost consideration when it comes to making business decisions.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247347">Our decision to find a records management service provider involved a thorough risk assessment with due consideration paid to all aspects of physical, personal and technological security. I can assure the member that privacy risks have been properly assessed and due diligence was done, including extensive consultation with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3247348">Currently, CRA is in the process of finding a records management service provider through a competitive process. The RFP has clearly identified and addressed privacy-related requirements including placing priority on keeping sensitive taxpayer information under government control and within Canadian borders. Consequently, the contractual documents require that all records processing, storage, transportation and destruction must take place in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247349">The successful bidder's facilities will be state-of-the-art, with remotely monitored alarm systems, digital closed-circuit TV systems, infrared motion detection systems and other technical safeguards such as fire detection and suppression and biometric access controls to protect the privacy and security of taxpayer information.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247350">Using a records management service provider gives the agency access to ongoing technology, and process improvements will eliminate processing steps and will reduce total costs to the CRA, while ensuring the security, privacy and safety of the records.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247351">Private sector innovation and expertise offer the agency economies of scale and storage costs that are directly proportional to the storage and service used. Moving to using a records management service provider will provide the CRA with ongoing annual savings beyond 2015, while ensuring the safety, privacy and security of our records.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Why is the minister from P.E.I. moving jobs off Prince Edward Island and trying to move government paid workers to lower minimum wage jobs?

I was not satisfied with the answer I received, so I would like to revisit the issue here this evening.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247358">The structure of the new the social security tribunal, commonly known as the SST, is unacceptable. The Conservatives have systematically reduced access to programs, and they are now doing the same thing with appeal mechanisms. Furthermore, instead of creating a more efficient system, they are only adding to processing times.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247359">I am here to repeat my question: why discourage unemployed workers from appealing, if not to deter them from applying for the benefits to which they are entitled, or to force them to move and accept a lower wage? </ParaText><ParaText id="3247360">There are many negative aspects to the changes made to the appeal mechanism. At present, when someone's EI claim is denied, they can appeal the decision directly before a tribunal—known as the board of referees—that is made up of three people. It normally consists of a chair and two assessors.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247361">Beginning in April, with the elimination of the board of referees and the tripartite system, hearings are not guaranteed and a single member of the new social security tribunal will make the decision.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3247362">We also now know that the Conservatives save well-paying jobs for their cronies or even former candidates who were defeated. In Quebec, of all the appointments made so far, none of the new members of the social security tribunal is a former labour representative.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247363">The appeal system has also been consolidated and centralized, reducing the number of members from 700 to 850 part-time and 39 full-time members to review some 27,000 cases annually across the country. How can there not be new wait times? The numbers speak for themselves, and it is absolutely disgusting.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247364">Also, in the new first-level appeal system, claimants will have the right to appeal within 30 days of the decision, in writing please. They may also face a summary rejection on a paper review or at a hearing in <I>x</I> number of days. It may also be possible to extend the appeal period for special reasons, but within a maximum of one year. A review of the decision will be possible in the event of new information but, once again, within a maximum of one year.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3247365">At the second level, the system will go from 32 judges hearing about 2,300 cases a year, to 13 judges for all of Canada. It will be possible to appeal with permission only within 30 days. We believe that this new system will abandon the unemployed and cut them off from the employment insurance system. They will have less access to it, and our families will suffer more and more.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

In three of the four current tribunals, each case is heard by a three-member panel chosen from among over 1,200 part-time members. These members hear appeals, on average, two days per month. This is inefficient, as we can tell.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247368">A great deal of complex logistics and administrative support is required to keep these part-time members engaged and fully informed. Support staff must train these members and keep them informed of current appeal and other legal decisions that may affect cases put before tribunal members.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247369">In addition, under the current system files are generated manually, resulting in a lot of cumbersome paperwork.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247370">Panel members must hear cases in person, and that means that there are significant administrative and travel expenses.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247371">The new social security tribunal would be made up of 70 members, all working full time, appointed by order in council. In place of panels, cases would be dealt with by one member. These members would be dedicated solely to hearing and deciding on appeals.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3247372">Having full-time members would allow the social security tribunal's support staff to concentrate on what they should doing, that is, the appeal process itself. This would enable members to hear and render decisions more effectively. It would also significantly reduce the work that is involved in appointing, training and briefing them.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247373">With respect to fairness, one of the hallmarks of the current process is the independent relationships members have with the department and their impartiality. This independence would be preserved in the social security tribunal, and the importance of objectivity and neutrality would continue to be emphasized. The expertise of decision-makers would not be affected.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247374">The new social security tribunal would provide two levels of appeal. The first, the general division, would have two sections for appeals, one for employment insurance and the other for CPP and OAS. The second level, the appeal division, would hear all appeals from the general division. Both divisions would be dedicated to providing fair and impartial reviews of government decisions. Members would be assigned to one section, based upon their particular experience.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247375">As for the appeals themselves, we are going to see quite a few changes.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247376">First, case files would be generated electronically, eliminating heavy paperwork. Instead of appearing in person, appellants could apply to have their cases taken by phone or video conference whenever possible.</ParaText>

It was a real surprise, especially since the government did not announce it during the election campaign.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247387">Unfortunately, when I asked the <Affiliation DbId="170700" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> my question, he did not respond in any way to the concerns of Canadians about the changes to this legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247388">However, my question was quite clear, simple and inspired by comments from Canadians. I travelled around the riding of Mégantic—L'Érable and the Chaudière River area to find out if the public knew about this reform. They told me that they did not know that Lac Mégantic, Rivière Chaudière, or even Rivière Saint-François, in my riding, would no longer have environmental protection.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3247389">Following my visit, people came to see me. They could not believe that their Conservative MP did not stand up for their river or lake. Even after I got back to my riding, I received a number of calls from people who wanted to thank me and to tell me that they were angry about this situation. These are a few examples of people in the community who were not aware of this reform. They were shocked and angry.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247390">When it comes to protecting navigable waters, I highly doubt that the legendary slogan that the Conservatives used to appeal to Canadians—“Our region in power”—can be applied. Instead, our slogan—“Our region abandoned by the Conservatives”—seems more fitting. The comments my colleague made earlier about employment insurance shows that this is true. The same thing is happening here. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3247391">In this respect, we are wondering why the Conservatives allowed the President of the Treasury Board to protect the lakes of the rich and famous in his riding and abandon the rest of Canadians. That is the question.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247392">I examined the whole situation carefully and there is no reasonable explanation. It is important to mention that, when asked a question in the House, my NDP colleague clearly showed that the website regarding the Navigable Waters Protection Act mentioned the word “environment” dozens of times. As soon as she mentioned this in the House—the next day, I believe—the website was completely changed with every instance of the word “environment” removed. This may have been a coincidence, but I think that it was arranged by the Conservative Party.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247393">People are upset that the government is abandoning environmental protection. They do not understand why certain lakes and rivers are protected while others, such as Rivière Saint-François, Lac Mégantic, and Rivière Chaudière, are not. That is my question. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

This law is not environmental and it never has been; therefore, the amendments will have no impact on the environment.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247396">The Navigable Waters Protection Act exists to reconcile conflicting interests in the case of ships and bridges, for example. It allows Canadians to have access to these waters for transportation and construction. That is the main reason this law was created.</ParaText><ParaText id="3247397">Currently, the law applies to waters where navigation is questionable. Our public servants are obliged to work on projects that have nothing to do with navigation.

All of those laws will continue to protect the waterways that the member mentioned in his speech. </ParaText><ParaText id="3247399">The reality is that the laws on navigation will apply only to those waters that have navigation. It would seem to me that would make sense. When there is a small stream that is not capable of carrying any large-scale navigation and a farmer wants to build a small footbridge over it, I do not think it is necessary for the national transportation department to come out and make sure that a shipping vessel will not be interrupted by that footbridge. When the people at Wabamun Lake in Alberta want to build small recreational docks so their kids can fish off them, or God forbid, jump in the lake, I do not think it is necessary to have federal bureaucrats ensuring that shipping tankers will not be interrupted.
