Second reading</ProceduralText><ParaText id="2250265">The House resumed from November 1 consideration of the motion that Bill <Document DbId="4329129" Type="4">C-510, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (coercion)</Document>, be read the second time and referred to a committee.</ParaText><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Milliken" id="3669992"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128909" Type="15">The Speaker</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2250266">When this matter was last before the House, the hon. member for Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar had the floor, and there are five minutes remaining in the time allotted for her remarks. I therefore call upon the hon. member for Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mrs. Block" id="3669993"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128336" Type="2">Mrs. Kelly Block (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2250267">Mr. Speaker, since I stood in the House last month to speak in support of Roxanne's Law, I have heard from countless Canadians across the country, especially women, expressing their strong support for the bill, which would give Canadian women much needed protection against unwanted abortions.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250268">The evidence completely dispels the notion expressed last month in this chamber that women do not want this protection. Nothing I have seen, heard or read could be further from the truth. </ParaText><ParaText id="2250269">The sad reality is that abortion coercion does take place in Canada. We all know about Roxanne Fernando who was murdered by the father of her unborn child after refusing to end her pregnancy. A recent case involving abortion coercion in Calgary also had a fatal outcome. Melinda Morin was convicted of manslaughter for killing her boyfriend in a fit of rage after he attacked her during an argument about her pregnancy. He wanted her to have an abortion but she refused. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250270">Those two examples tell us that if a women is feeling threatened into an unwanted abortion, she may be either the victim or the perpetrator of violence. Both are extreme and tragic examples of what can happen when others try to impose unwanted abortions on pregnant women. I am certainly not saying that all cases involving abortion coercion will end in violence but those stories do illustrate this tragic and deadly outcome that can result when we, as a society, do not take abortion coercion seriously and when we do not condemn it loudly and clearly, as Roxanne's Law would surely do.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250271">While most cases of abortion coercion do not end in the death of either the pregnant women or the person who is pressuring them to terminate their pregnancy, any successful attempt at abortion coercion will always result in the death of that woman's wanted unborn child. Turning a blind eye to this reality violates Canadians' high standards of justice and human rights. It is no wonder our own refugee board has called forced and coerced abortion a crime against humanity.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250272">Some women in Canada are forced to abort when the fetus is female. The practice of aborting baby girls has been strongly condemned by UNICEF and various medical organizations, including the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada. A UN rep in 2005 said about this practice:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250273"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">It is fundamentally wrong, morally wrong, socially wrong and developmentally wrong to tolerate, stand and watch such acts of sex selection and violence against girls. </QuotePara>
								</Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2250274">It was also strongly denounced by the member for Vancouver South, a former Liberal health minister, who wrote in April 2008 in the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I>: </ParaText><ParaText id="2250275"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Sex selection for the purpose of committing female feticide is one of the most heinous acts of violence and hatred inflicted on women. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2250276">A report in October 2009 in the <I>Toronto Star</I>, highlighted the case of one pregnant woman who sought help from a community health centre that serves the community that has a preference for male children. The woman was pregnant for the third time with a female child. Her family forced her to abort her two previous pregnancies because they did not want girl babies. She was hoping to save the third female child. However, the centre lost contact with the woman for a period of time and, when they did manage to contact her again, the woman said that she had a miscarriage.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250277">We need to send the message loudly and clearly that forcing and coercing women to abort their children is not acceptable behaviour. We need to promote a culture of respect for women who make the choice to be mothers. We need to give Canadian women the assurance that the law will be there to protect them when they take on the monumental responsibility of bringing children into the world.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250278"> There is no question that Roxanne's Law would do all those things. A vote against Roxanne's Law, on the other hand, will appear as a vote in favour of continuing the oppression and degradation of women and girls, including those still in the womb.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Bonsant" id="3669997"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128168" Type="2">Ms. France Bonsant (Compton—Stanstead, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2250279">Mr. Speaker, on this side of the House, we have a tendency to recite the long list of the Conservative government's faults. But upon reading Bill <Document DbId="4329129" Type="4">C-510</Document>, I finally found something positive: this government is inventive.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250280">Its dedication to limiting a woman's right to choose regarding abortion fascinates me. We thought it had tried everything, particularly with Bill <Document DbId="3097460" Type="4">C-484</Document> on unborn children and its regressive international policy on maternal health. The cuts to Status of Women Canada, the court challenges program and the women's program are just more examples.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250281">Although their actions show that they want to criminalize abortion and set back women's rights, the Conservatives keep repeating that they do not want to reopen the debate. But they are the ones who keep bringing this issue back to the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250282">This time, with Bill <Document DbId="4329129" Type="4">C-510, An Act to Prevent Coercion of Pregnant Women to Abort</Document>, the government wants to impose five-year prison sentences for anyone who coerces a woman to have an abortion and two-year prison sentences for anyone who attempts to coerce a woman to have an abortion.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250283">The Conservatives are using the case of Roxanne Fernando, who was killed by three men, to misrepresent things. The crown prosecutor, one of the murderers and his lawyer have all stated that the murder had nothing whatsoever to do with the woman's refusal to have an abortion. The Conservatives are using this barbaric act to threaten the right to abortion, even if this right was not the issue. This was a case of domestic violence.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250284">With Bill <Document DbId="4329129" Type="4">C-510</Document>, the Conservatives are moving forward with their right-wing political agenda instead of attacking the real problem, which is violence against women. The real solutions are based on achieving equality between men and women. This has to do with better access to the justice system through legal aid, financial assistance for victims of crime and their loved ones, pay equity and other improvements to social programs.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250285">In addition to being so creative, the Conservatives also have a talent for bringing women's rights groups together. The Fédération des femmes du Québec is opposed to passing Bill <Document DbId="4329129" Type="4">C-510</Document>. It has declared that since the Conservatives took power, “abortion has never been so threatened”. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250286">The Fédération du Québec pour le planning des naissances has also spoken out against Bill <Document DbId="4329129" Type="4">C-510</Document>. The federation expects the bill to have a number of negative consequences, one of which is that it will open the door to the criminalization of abortion. The federation also fears, with good reason, that workers in this area could be prosecuted if the bill is passed. The very vague concept of “coercion” would give the unborn child certain rights to the woman's detriment.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250287">For these same reasons, a number of other organizations, including Canadians for Choice, are strongly opposed to the initiative of the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128416" Type="2">Winnipeg South</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250288"> At the very least, it can be said that the Conservatives do not give up. Since coming to power, they have tried every sly tactic they can think of to reopen the debate on abortion, but have been unsuccessful. On September 2, 2010, the infamous Dimitri Soudas stated that his party did not want to reopen the debate on this issue. Since that time, several members have made similar statements. Nevertheless, last May, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128416" Type="2">Winnipeg South</Affiliation> said that it is “always important to take steps, small steps, to acknowledge the value of the unborn”. Finally, a Conservative member who is willing to tell the truth about his intentions. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250289">Twenty-two years ago, the Supreme Court invalidated the anti-abortion provisions of the Criminal Code of Canada. Since that time, there has been a strong consensus in our society that the debate on this issue should be over. However, from time to time, the Conservative <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> agrees to reward the most well-behaved radicals in his party by letting them introduce regressive bills. Each time, the members of the House oppose these bills, with the exception of the Conservatives and a few misguided Liberals.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2250290">But that does not matter. Listening to the peoples' representatives in Parliament is not an option for this government. Not only is Bill <Document DbId="4329129" Type="4">C-510</Document> downright disgraceful, it is also useless.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250291">Counsellors at abortion clinics already screen women to ensure that they have not been coerced into abortion. Clinics refuse to perform abortions on women who are not sure of their decision or who are being coerced by a third party. In addition, the Criminal Code prohibits threats and assaults against women. That is why the criminals who murdered Roxanne Fernando are in prison. Nathanael Plourde was sentenced to 25 years in prison, and Manuel Toruno was sentenced to at least 10 years in prison. Their 17-year-old accomplice was given the maximum sentence for a minor: six years in prison and four years of probation. The maximum prison sentences proposed by this bill, five years and two years, are totally absurd and useless.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250292">A woman's decision to abort is rarely made alone, although it is a decision that must clearly be made without any persuasion. As I just said, such coercion is already prohibited by the Criminal Code. However, it is normal for an adolescent or a woman to seek advice from those close to her. If this person's mother, father, brother, sister or partner counsels her not to keep the baby, the bill is so vague that the pregnant woman's family could be subject to jail time. That is completely unacceptable.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250293">Bill <Document DbId="4329129" Type="4">C-510</Document> is also condescending towards women. It suggests that they are often coerced into abortion and that they cannot make the decision on their own. But women are free to make that choice and they must continue to be free.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250294">To conclude, I would like to emphasize that my political party and I are fiercely opposed to this bill. As a woman and a mother, I am personally insulted by these dangerous measures that restrict freedom of choice regarding abortion. In the name of women's right and freedoms, I ask all members to oppose it. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Ashton" id="3670001"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128733" Type="2">Ms. Niki Ashton (Churchill, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2250295">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to speak in this important debate today.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250296">As the youngest woman in the House of Commons, I do not believe we would be discussing a bill in 2010 that would seek to take away the rights for which women before me have fought so hard. While the bill claims to react to a tragic situation around coercion and the discussion of abortion, it is an attack on a woman's right to choose.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250297">The bill is mostly redundant because threats and illegal acts are already covered under the Criminal Code. In fact, this part of the debate is so critical to the discussion. It is certainly not a discussion about the facts. Unfortunately what is in the Criminal Code is not being discussed in the House. Bill <Document DbId="4329129" Type="4">C-510</Document> is unnecessary and it is redundant. Threats and illegal acts are already covered under the Criminal Code. Counsellors at abortion clinics already screen for possible coercion in women seeking abortions.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250298">The anti-choice movement has noted claims that women are coerced. However, when we walk by abortion clinics across our country, and certainly even the one close to Parliament Hill, we see a much greater movement to coerce women not to get an abortion, often with very aggressive tactics, taking advantage of women who are already in a vulnerable situation, who are already having to make a very difficult decision, often a very conflicted decision.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250299">This debate is also one that is so critical because it identifies the notion of fetal rights that challenges the discussion and the way abortion and a woman's right to choose are legally framed, noting that women have the control over their bodies. The discussion is about the fetus, not the child. As we enter into this discussion, many of us fear that this will open the door to making abortions in our country illegal. The bill attempts to reintroduce the notion of fetal rights through indirect means, by presenting abortion as a social harm to be criminalized.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250300">I noted earlier that while the foundation of the bill is based on a tragic experience, one that took place in my home province, it is important to recognize that much of what has come out has been misrepresented. We note that in this legal case, the murderer, the lawyer and the crown prosecutor all agreed that coercion to have an abortion was not the motive. The bill claims that it would prevent what happened Ms. Roxanne Fernando from Winnipeg. However, when we look at it more closely, it attacks the rights of women to choose, it challenges the work of abortion providers and it rolls back the rights of women in our country by decades.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250301">Unfortunately this is not a new development. The Conservative government and members of it have promoted an anti-choice agenda since they were elected into government. Ironically, in past elections it was stated that a Conservative government would not support any legislation to regulate abortion. Yet the bill deals entirely with that issue. It strives to take a major step in challenging that right of women to choose.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2250302">Unfortunately, the bill and the words used to present it have been framed in such a way as to claim to deal with the violence that women face, not only in the discussion around a woman's right to choose, but generally violence that women face. We all know that women face levels of violence, domestic violence, physical, sexual and mental violence in a way that we do not see it with men.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250303">Unfortunately, the bill would do nothing to deal with those levels of violence. Not only would the bill not do anything, the government has done nothing. Not only has it failed to reinvest in and continue programs that are critical, it has sought to take away gains that have been made in policy, governing structure and the supports that women look to in order to seek equality.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250304">How many signs do we need to know how much further we have to go forward, not just in the levels of violence that women face. We also need to look at the absence of women in power structures and positions of decision making? It is shameful that in the year 2010 only 21% of the members in the House of Commons are women.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250305">Young people ask me why that is the case. I believe we can look, unfortunately, at very recent policies that seek to strip away the voice of women, as well as men, to speak out as to what is needed for us to eradicate gender-based violence and for women to truly achieve equality.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250306">Let us look at some of the Conservative government's work, not only in the discussion around attacking women's right to choose, but the overall attack on women to achieve equality.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250307">From 2006 onward, we have seen the elimination of equality as an objective in the Status of Women Canada's mission statement. We have seen a 100% cut in funding for advocacy, lobbying and independent research projects funded by the Status of Women Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250308">Dozens of feminist organizations have had their funding severed and have had to close their doors. In the past year, nine groups have lost their funding, including the Canadian Research Institute for the Advancement of Women, the New Brunswick Pay Equity Coalition and Réseau des tables régionales de groupes de femmes du Québec. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250309">We have shamefully seen the lose of funding for the Sisters in Spirit initiative that has sought to counteract the tragic and historically perpetuated levels of violence against aboriginal women. While the government promoted the work of Sisters in Spirit for years in the House, it did not renew the funding for an organization that clearly made known the barriers that aboriginal women faced.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250310">We also saw the loss of funds for over 130 projects in the Aboriginal Healing Foundation, the cancellation of the pan-Canadian child care program and the elimination of the court challenges program.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250311">We need to look at ensuring women have economic support. In my home community in the province of Manitoba, women are going to be losing their jobs in the smelter and the refinery, only to be made more vulnerable in an economy facing a recession.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250312">These are the messages, the actions we need to support women in their work to achieve equality, in our work as Canadians to achieve equality. We need to leave alone the battles for which women, along with men, have fought, which are the right to choose, the right to shape our futures and the right to be equal in our country, Canada.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Rathgeber" id="3670021"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128244" Type="2">Mr. Brent Rathgeber (Edmonton—St. Albert, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2250313">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill <Document DbId="4329129" Type="4">C-510</Document>, an act to prevent coercion of pregnant women to abort, which was first introduced in the House by the member for <Affiliation DbId="128416" Type="2">Winnipeg South</Affiliation> in April.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250314">In his press release dated April 15 of this year, the bill's sponsor stated:</ParaText><ParaText id="2250315"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">This bill would help protect a pregnant woman who does not want to terminate her pregnancy...No woman should ever feel intimidated to have an unwanted abortion. Anyone who attempts to force a woman to abort her wanted fetus should face consequences.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2250316">At the outset, I certainly agree with that sentiment and I have great respect for the sponsor, my friend from <Affiliation DbId="128416" Type="2">Winnipeg South</Affiliation>. However, I am troubled by the legislation before the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250317">I am sure we all agree that the safety of all Canadians is paramount, in particular protecting the most vulnerable in our society from violence. It is clear that violence against all women, pregnant or not, is a serious issue, with far-reaching effects and consequences.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250318">Violence against women is a persistent and ongoing problem in Canada and around the world, affecting women's personal safety and their ability to contribute to society. It also affects their children, who witness this violence and experience its aftermath, therefore contributing to intergenerational cycles of violence. Although Canadian women fare better than women in most parts of the world, violence against women, sadly, persists in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250319"> However, Canada's criminal law provides a broad range of measures designed to protect persons from violence, including provisions prohibiting all of the following: assault and sexual assault, murder and manslaughter, kidnapping, forcible confinement, trafficking in persons, criminal harassment, uttering threats and intimidation. This government has taken concrete steps to build on these protections through further recent criminal law reforms to ensure that everyone, particularly the most vulnerable members of our society, feel safe and secure in their homes and communities. </ParaText><ParaText id="2250320">The government is proud of its accomplishments in promoting safe streets and communities. For example, the Tackling Violent Crime Act, enacted in 2008, includes enhanced mandatory minimum penalties for firearms offences and strengthens the danger offender provisions. Bill <Document DbId="4668958" Type="3">C-48</Document>, which is recently before the justice committee on which I proudly serve as a member, would protect Canadians by ending sentence discounts for multiple murders act. It will return to the House in short order.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250321">The Criminal Code also takes violence against women into account in its sentencing provisions, which requires that spousal abuse and abuse of positions of trust or authority must be considered as aggravating circumstances for the purposes of sentencing. In other words, this fact should increase the sentence imposed against the perpetrator.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250322"> It is evident that Canadian criminal law aims to protect all women, indeed all Canadians, from violence in its many forms.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250323">As I understand it, Bill <Document DbId="4329129" Type="4">C-510</Document>, also known as Roxanne's law, was introduced in response to the tragic murder of Roxanne Fernando because of her unexpected pregnancy in a volatile relationship. She was tragically murdered by her boyfriend and two of his friends. One of the reported motives was that Ms. Fernando was murdered because she would not have an abortion. </ParaText><ParaText id="2250324">It is important to point out that all three offenders involved in this murder are currently serving prison sentences for that murder. There is no question that this is a tragic case, but appears to be one where the criminal justice system has been used to its fullest extent.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250325">Since the case of Ms. Fernando was the inspiration for Bill <Document DbId="4329129" Type="4">C-510</Document>, let me now discuss the legal effects of the bill. I apologize in advance that some of it is technical and legal, but it is important that members understand the legal ramifications of the bill.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250326">Bill <Document DbId="4329129" Type="4">C-510</Document> would create two new hybrid Criminal Code offences. The first would be the offence of coercing a woman to procure an abortion she did not want. This would be punishable by a maximum sentence of five years on indictment and 18 months on summary conviction. The second proposed offence would be the offence of attempting to coerce a woman to procure an abortion she did not want. This would be punishable by a maximum of two years imprisonment on indictment and six months on summary conviction.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250327">The bill proposes a number of definitions to help bring clarity to these offences. Most notably, the bill defines “coercion” and explains where coercive behaviour would reach the level of attracting criminal liability.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2250328">The bill states that a person coerces an abortion when he or she engages in conduct that directly or indirectly causes a pregnant woman to consent to an abortion that she would otherwise have refused. The bill goes further to include anyone who conspires with another person to engage in coercive conduct. </ParaText><ParaText id="2250329">Also in the definition of coercion is a list of conduct that could amount to coercion if it were undertaken for the purpose of causing a pregnant woman to have an unwanted abortion. The conduct includes, but is not limited to, violent and threatening behaviour directed either at the woman, her fetus or a third party. Also included is removing, or threatening to remove, financial support or housing from the pregnant woman in attempting to compel by pressure or intimidation including “argumentative and rancorous badgering and importunity”.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250330">While most would agree, and I certainly would, that we would not want to encourage such conduct, it is not conduct that normally attracts criminal sanction.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250331">The bill states that the conduct outlined in the proposed definition of coercion is not exhaustive. Therefore, it could encompass much more conduct than is currently outlined in the bill, or for that matter, that the author of the bill foresaw, but it leaves this open to be determined be a court.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250332">A final part of the definition of coercion is what I call the charter exemption. It is a novel approach in crafting a criminal offence. The bill states that speech, which we all know is protected by section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, would not be captured by the definition of coercion and therefore would not attract criminal liability.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250333">There are two other sections of the bill that are worth noting. </ParaText><ParaText id="2250334">First is the limited exemption for a physician who attempts to convince a pregnant woman to have a medical intervention, which may result in the death of the fetus, when the woman's physical health is endangered.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250335">Second is the unique severability provision, which states that if any provisions of this bill are found to be invalid or unenforceable they are to be severed from the bill and shall not affect the application of the other provisions.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250336">In summary, the impacts of this bill would be to criminalize conduct that is already captured by several Criminal Code offences. </ParaText><ParaText id="2250337">For example, conduct such as committing, attempting to commit or threatening to commit physical harm is captured by the offence of uttering threats in section 264.1, assault in section 265 and the general attempt provisions contained in section 24 of the Criminal Code. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250338">Other types of conduct, such as compelling by pressure and rancorous badgering and importunity, are not defined in the bill and would most likely lead to interpretative difficulties and subsequent charter challenges.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250339"> Further, interpretive difficulties would most certainly arise because of the charter exemption, which attempts to insulate certain types of conduct from criminal liability if the conduct is protected by section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. </ParaText><ParaText id="2250340">This exemption would require individuals, police and prosecutors to determine whether the conduct in question is protected by the charter, though ultimately it would be the courts that would have to pronounce and be determinative on this issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250341">Finally, the novel severability provision, which aims to sever any provision of the bill that a court finds unenforceable, could be interpreted as fettering the discretion of the court to determine the appropriate remedy in the event of a charter breach.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250342">In short and to conclude, I certainly appreciate the objective of the bill and support its author in bringing this matter forward to this House for debate. I believe all members of this House support better protection of pregnant women against any specific form of violence and, in fact, protection for all members of society against all forms of violence. However, I strongly believe that the existing Criminal Code protections adequately protect women, as evidenced by the convictions and significant penalties imposed in the Roxanne Fernando case.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250343"> With all due respect and for those reasons, I will be voting against Bill <Document DbId="4329129" Type="4">C-510</Document>. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Shipley" id="3670027"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128495" Type="2">Mr. Bev Shipley (Lambton—Kent—Middlesex, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2250344">Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak in support of this great bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250345">It is important for all members to be fully informed before they vote on Bill <Document DbId="4329129" Type="4">C-510</Document>, so I want to address several misconceptions about this bill that were revealed during the first hour of debate.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250346">First, the bill was criticized for using language that was vague and would therefore be subject to a charter challenge. The member who made these comments referred to phrases used in the bill, such as “compel by pressure”, which he said was quite new, and “rancorous badgering”, which he said was extremely new.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250347">Quite honestly, in fact, while the language may seem unusual, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128416" Type="2">Winnipeg South</Affiliation> has been assured by legal experts that it comes from long, settled legal jurisprudence.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250348">I also understand from legal experts that the threshold for deeming a law vague is high, and in their opinion the wording used in Bill <Document DbId="4329129" Type="4">C-510</Document> gives clear direction as to what is prohibited and how the section should be enforced.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250349">Terms used, such as rancorous badgering, as previously mentioned, and coercion have been considered and upheld by various courts in both criminal and labour law cases. These terms, along with others found in the bill, therefore provide sufficient guidance to avoid allegations of vagueness.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250350">Second, during the debate, one member claimed that this bill would restrict access to freedom of choice. The truth is that the bill actually expands the pregnant woman's choice and freedom to protect her against anyone who uses coercive means to take away her freedom to continue her pregnancy.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250351">The only choice restricted by this bill is the choice of a third party who wants to impose an abortion on a woman against her will.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250352">Should this bill be enacted into law, full legal access to abortion will still be available to women who freely choose that option. It would be no different, the same as today.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250353">Third, a very serious misreading of the existing Criminal Code is obviously behind the statement made by a member who said, “This bill recognizes the fetus as a child and therefore a person with legal status”.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250354">If the member's comments were actually true, that is, if recognizing the fetus as a child in the Criminal Code implies that the fetus is a person with legal status, then that would mean that the fetus is a person with legal status right now, that is today, because the Criminal Code as it exists today also refers to the fetus as a child. Obviously that would have a legal impact on abortion today without Bill <Document DbId="4329129" Type="4">C-510</Document>.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250355"> The member was incorrect in stating that the use of the word “child” implies anything about personhood. The Criminal Code currently uses the term “child” and only that term when referring to the fetus. The Criminal Code, much to the disappointment of pro-life people, quite honestly defines human beings in section 223(1) as follows: </ParaText><ParaText id="2250356"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">A child becomes a human being within the meaning of this Act when it has completely proceeded, in a living state, from the body of its mother.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2250357">Fourth, the same member was also incorrect when she stated that Bill <Document DbId="4329129" Type="4">C-510</Document> contradicts the election promises of the Conservative Party. During the last election, its platform stated, “A Conservative Government will not support any legislation to regulate abortion”.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250358">Of course there are two problems with this statement. First, Bill <Document DbId="4329129" Type="4">C-510</Document> has nothing to do with the Conservative government. It is a private member's bill, not a government bill. Second, while it is true that the Conservative government does have a policy as described by the member, Bill <Document DbId="4329129" Type="4">C-510</Document> does not go against that policy.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250359">As I said before, and it bears repeating because people do not seem to understand this point, this bill does not regulate abortion in any way.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250360">Bill <Document DbId="4329129" Type="4">C-510</Document> does not prohibit a single abortion and it does not regulate a single abortion. It deals only with behaviour that aims to impose an abortion on a woman who does not want it.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="40">(1140)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2250361">Not only does Bill <Document DbId="4329129" Type="4">C-510</Document> not go against existing Conservative policy; it actually is supported by another Conservative policy adopted in 2008, which recognizes the need for additional protection for pregnant women.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250362">Fifth, another member criticized the bill for being totally redundant. She claimed it was entirely covered already by existing Criminal Code offences. Whether every single behaviour that could conceivably be captured by Bill <Document DbId="4329129" Type="4">C-510</Document> is already sprinkled throughout various existing provisions in the Criminal Code is not at all clear. While there is certainly some overlap, it is almost certain that some of what constitutes abortion coercion in Bill C-510 would not be a crime today.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250363">What is clear is that, while coercion clearly occurs, we are all well aware from various reports, as well as from personal testimonies, that no one has been charged with this offence. This means that our current laws are not doing their job. </ParaText><ParaText id="2250364">It hardly matters if something is already illegal if no one, including the victim, the perpetrator or the police, actually knows it is illegal. Bill <Document DbId="4329129" Type="4">C-510</Document> would clarify the law. With a clear law on the books, a law that defines abortion coercion explicitly, which no law currently does, pregnant women would be more aware of their rights and would be empowered to take action before it is too late, not after.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250365"> The general public would also become more aware and this would help curb coercive behaviour against pregnant women in the first place. I believe Bill <Document DbId="4329129" Type="4">C-510</Document> would raise the public conscience to a new level of respect for pregnant women, which would have a positive impact not only on the lives of women but the whole of Canadian society.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250366">We already have offences that one could argue are not necessary because more general provisions would cover them. For example, let us use the definition of assault. It is intentionally very broad, intended to encompass all sorts and forms of assault, but Parliament chose to add sections specifying assault with a weapon, aggravated assault, sexual assault and assault causing bodily harm. These crimes were specified because they were deemed unambiguously worthy of condemnation. I hope the critics of Bill <Document DbId="4329129" Type="4">C-510</Document> are not implying that coercing a woman to abort a wanted pregnancy is not especially worthy of condemnation.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250367">It is significant to note that this type of law also exists in other free democratic societies. For example, translation of a German law states, “whosever unlawfully with force or threat of serious harm causes a person to commit, suffer or omit an act shall be liable to imprisonment...”. An especially serious case typically occurs if the offender causes a pregnant woman to terminate a pregnancy.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250368">In Italy, any person inducing a pregnancy termination without the consent of the woman shall be liable to four to eight years imprisonment. Consent extracted by violence or threats or under false pretenses shall be deemed not to be granted.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250369">Laws also exist in France and some U.S. states.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250370">Bill <Document DbId="4329129" Type="4">C-510</Document> has the potential to do much good. The criticisms made against it are based on misunderstandings of the bill and misunderstandings about laws that exist today. Numerous other jurisdictions worldwide have similar laws. Women today, especially those who are in vulnerable situations, can only be helped by such a law. It would have no impact on the current legal status of abortion in this country.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250371">I support this bill, and I see no reason to prevent it from getting a fair hearing at committee.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I am not sure if the members opposite, particularly the member for <Affiliation DbId="128733" Type="2">Churchill</Affiliation>, were uninformed or deliberately trying to give the wrong impression about the bill, but I got the sense that the member for Churchill seemed to be implying that Roxanne Fernando's death did not come about as a result of her refusal to have an abortion. </ParaText><ParaText id="2250373">It is important to point out that the crown prosecutor at the sentencing hearing was very clear when he talked about the fact that this was specifically a motive by these young men who took her life.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250374">We need to remember that a young lady lost her life over this issue. We have heard people this morning say this is all covered in the Criminal Code. Her murder was covered in the Criminal Code and these young men are serving their time for that, which they rightly should be doing, but the issue of coercion was not covered in the Criminal Code. Those men were not charged with that. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250375">We need to refocus the debate today back on the element of coercion and the fact that women should not be coerced in their dealings with their children. It is not in the interest of women or children to pretend otherwise.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250376">We need to be clear this morning that the debate has been about the issue of coerced abortion. This is not a bill about abortion and restricting abortion rights. I think those folks who have indicated that either do not understand the bill clearly or are trying to perform some mischief.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250377">As we heard just a few minutes ago, other countries have felt it is important to bring this level of protection. I heard the member for <Affiliation DbId="128495" Type="2">Lambton—Kent—Middlesex</Affiliation> talk about the fact that Germany has brought in protection on this issue; that Italy has felt it is important that women be protected in this area; and that France also has seen that this is an important issue in terms of protecting women and children.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250378">In this country we need to have a better and more honest debate than we have had on this. </ParaText><ParaText id="2250379">There are states in the U.S. that have taken this up as something they feel is important to protect women's rights. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250380">I will wrap up by encouraging my colleagues to support the bill. It is an important bill. When my colleague presented the bill I said during questions and comments that this is a necessary bill. I thought it was necessary then and I think it is necessary now.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250381">I encourage my colleagues in the House to stand and support the bill and see it pass second reading.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Some mothers fall in love with their children even before birth in a way that few of us can understand. These mothers should never have to make a choice between protecting themselves or the child they love.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250384">Forced abortion should be made illegal in Canada. Roxanne's law would accomplish this. The main argument used against Roxanne's law is that the bill is totally redundant because, so opponents claim, abortion coercion is already covered in the Criminal Code under existing provisions for assaults, uttering threats or intimidation. If I wanted to oppose a bill whose sole purpose was to protect women from abortion coercion, I too would want to find some excuse that made it sound like I was in favour of forced abortion. Saying it is already illegal gives me that cover. It allows me to oppose the bill for what sounds to be a legitimate reason while still professing how terrible it is to coerce a woman into having an abortion. After all, who wants to be known as someone who supports what the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada called a crime against humanity? The problem is that the argument that it is already illegal falls apart upon analysis.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250385">Although some of the conduct described in Bill <Document DbId="4329129" Type="4">C-510</Document> could fall under existing provisions in the Criminal Code, depending on the circumstances, not all behaviour that could fall under the definition of coercion in Bill C-510 would be captured under existing provisions. It is important to note that the list of examples of coercion in Bill C-510 is not exhaustive. This allows the court some discretion in deciding what constitutes abortion coercion given how it is defined in the bill. Above all though, the fact that no one has ever been charged with coercing an abortion in Canada is absolute proof that clarification of the law is desperately needed, a law Roxanne Fernando could have used to protect herself. </ParaText><ParaText id="2250386">Even in cases where a more general provision would suffice, there is tremendous value in having a new Criminal Code provision specific to abortion coercion. Criminal law scholars say we use the criminal law as a way of indicating a serious condemnation of an activity or action not only to punish people but also to state our most important social values and to send a clear message expressing society's rejection and intolerance of a specific act. When we single out coerced abortion as a separate offence, it is a signal that such behaviour should be denounced as a serious offence. It reflects a social value about the unacceptability of forcing a pregnant woman into ending a pregnancy she wants to continue.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250387">Creating specific provisions when a more general provision already exists in the Criminal Code is not a new idea. There are three such bills currently before Parliament which have passed at least one parliamentary vote. Bill <Document DbId="4491469" Type="3">S-9</Document> makes it an offence to steal a motor vehicle even though theft is already an offence. It received royal assent last month. Bill <Document DbId="4518631" Type="4">S-215</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="4328831" Type="4">C-464</Document> also bring important clarifications to laws that perhaps already capture the crimes contemplated. These are excellent ideas and important clarifications, just as Roxanne's law is.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250388">Thus, it is clear that as legislators we often create offences and provisions even when a more general provision would suffice. We do this in order to send a strong message of denunciation to affirm society's deeply held values and to educate the public. Should one choose to vote against Bill <Document DbId="4329129" Type="4">C-510</Document>, it will be seen as a choice to turn a blind eye to a horrible injustice.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250389">Roxanne Fernando's story has now been heard across the country and if not now, someday soon she will be considered a Canadian hero. In this Christmas season, I ask members to consider bringing additional protection to mothers with child who are facing dangerous circumstances.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

</ProceduralText><ParaText id="2250401">The House resumed from December 10 consideration of Bill <Document DbId="4445038" Type="3">S-6, An Act to amend the Criminal Code and another Act</Document>, as reported (with amendments) from the committee; and of the motions in Group No. 1.</ParaText><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Lemay" id="3670053"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128557" Type="2">Mr. Marc Lemay (Abitibi—Témiscamingue, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2250402">Mr. Speaker, since I have only 10 minutes and we are at the amendment stage, I will address that particular topic right away. The government proposed three amendments and I would like to set the record straight once and for all: we will be voting against those amendments, which would reinstate the short title. The government has a tendency to politicize things in these matters. The title of Bill <Document DbId="4445038" Type="3">S-6</Document> begins with “An Act to amend the Criminal Code”. We have no problem with that. Where we do have a problem is with the short title: “Serious Time for the Most Serious Crime Act”. Clearly, we will vote against these amendments. Clearly, we will vote against Bill S-6. Clearly, this government has no direction and is using this bill to try to appeal to the public.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250403">Bill <Document DbId="4445038" Type="3">S-6</Document> pertains to the faint hope clause. I would remind those watching us that in 1976, Canada abolished the death penalty for those who commit the most appalling, most serious crime in the Criminal Code: murder. Under the Liberals, the bill that abolished the death penalty also introduced what is known as the faint hope clause. Here is what it is all about. After a certain amount of time, after serving between 15 and 17 years in prison, offenders have the right—I hope they will still have this right—to apply to the Superior Court for the district in which the original sentence was handed down to be granted the opportunity to appear before the parole board. I am saying all this because Bill S-6, a bill from the Senate, is just not right. It makes absolutely no sense.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250404">The bill does not make sense and I hope the Liberals will wake up. I hope the Liberals will hear the truth and hear what is being said today and what will be said on this bill in the coming weeks, or months if necessary. In any event, this bill absolutely must not be passed. The faint hope clause, and I am quoting from the Library of Parliament:</ParaText><ParaText id="2250405">
								<Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...was added to the Criminal Code in the hope that it would provide an incentive for long-term offenders to rehabilitate themselves and, therefore, afford more protection to prison guards. </QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250406">I can understand where the Conservatives are coming from. They say they are in favour of protecting victims and that we absolutely must protect victims. They keep saying over and over again that we absolutely must protect victims.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250407">Therein lies the problem because the faint hope clause is working quite well. I hope my Conservative friends will listen, I cannot help it if they do not, but we will repeat this ad nauseam in the coming months: as of October 10, 2010, because the death penalty was abolished, there were 4,774 inmates serving life sentences in Canada. Contrary to what our Conservative friends think, and I hope the Liberals will finally hear the truth, those convicted of and serving time for murder are not sentenced to 25 years in prison. That is not true. They are sentenced to life imprisonment—for the rest of their days. I know that the Conservatives will never listen and never understand that.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="05">(1205)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2250408">These individuals will remain in the custody of the Correctional Service of Canada for the rest of their days. I repeat: it goes without saying that, for the rest of their days, these individuals will remain in the custody of the Correctional Service of Canada and the National Parole Board</ParaText><ParaText id="2250409">I only have five minutes for my speech and then there will be a five-minute period for questions, which I will be pleased to answer. I would like to provide some statistics. I did not make them up; they are from the Correctional Service of Canada. I asked the Conservatives to provide statistics to rebut the CSC data, but no one came up with any.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250410">In Canada, there are 4,774 inmates serving life sentences. Of these, 1,508 were eligible for judicial review. The death penalty was abolished in 1976, and therefore we had to wait 15 to 17 years before the first hearing was held in 1987. Since then, 181 decisions have been made: 146 resulted in a reduction of the ineligibility period for parole, and 35 were refused. Proof that the system works lies in the fact that it protects the public and therefore the victims.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250411">I will continue with the Correctional Service of Canada statistics: 144 inmates have now reached their revised eligibility dates and 135 have been released. Half of those released, or 68 inmates, have not posed a problem; they have reintegrated into society and been rehabilitated. Thirty-five had their parole suspended, but not revoked. They had minor breaches of conditions, such as returning home at midnight instead of 10 p.m. The rules are very strict and the National Parole Board monitors them very closely. Thus, 23 had their parole suspended, but afterwards things went smoothly. Only 23 of the possible 4,000 inmates had their parole revoked. Only 2 of those 23 out of the 4,000 were convicted of other violent crimes, such as aggravated assault or assault with a weapon, but not murder.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250412">So the system is working well. I do not understand the decision of this side of the House, the Liberal side. The Liberals are the ones who introduced the faint hope clause in 1976 after they abolished the death penalty. And it has been working so well that even the farthest-right, right-wing Conservatives are unable to provide us with any statistics to show that murders have been committed by parolees. This has not happened since 1987. The murderers who have been released from prison have all respected the conditions of their parole.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250413">I know that we are at the report and amendments stage, but I will come back to this later. I will certainly have the opportunity to rise in the House again and speak out against the cheap populist approach that the Conservatives are taking with this bill. It is a cheap populist approach to say that anyone can be released on parole when such is not the case. The organizations that are currently taking very good care of the public and victims are the National Parole Board and the Correctional Service of Canada.

Bill <Document DbId="4445038" Type="3">S-6</Document> in the previous session of the 40th Parliament was Bill <Document DbId="3951463" Type="3">C-36</Document>. The government tabled it in the House.

Instead, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> decided to prorogue the House in December 2009. The House was prorogued for close to two and a half months. </ParaText><ParaText id="2250430">When the second session of the 40th Parliament began on March 3, there was a throne speech. Did the government at its first opportunity reintroduce Bill <Document DbId="3951463" Type="3">C-36</Document>? No, it did not. It waited 48 days after the throne speech before tabling its legislation again. Then after tabling it 48 days after the throne speech, it let the bill sit, collecting dust, for 99 days before it moved second reading debate. If anyone has held up this bill it is not the opposition, definitely not the official opposition, but the government itself. </ParaText><ParaText id="2250431">The government counts on the fact that most Canadians are not paying enough attention to what is actually happening in the House and what the procedures are to realize that it is their own government that is holding up its own justice legislation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250432">One could speculate on the reasons the Conservative government has for doing do that. I speculate, given that every end of session in December and June for close to the last five years, the minister of justice, whoever he or she has been under the Conservative government, has gone to the media to claim that the opposition is holding up the government's justice bills and if the opposition would be conciliatory and work with the government, the justice bills would get through. </ParaText><ParaText id="2250433">When we look at each of the bills the government identifies at each one of those periods, June and December of 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and now 2010, those are the very bills that the government itself has held up, either by letting them sit at first reading and not moving second reading debate, or by not even introducing them initially.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250434">With those facts on the record, I would like now to speak to the content of Bill <Document DbId="4445038" Type="3">S-6</Document>.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="2250435">We know that victims and their families want the faint hope clause to be abolished. No one wants those found guilty of serious crimes to get out of jail without serving a long enough sentence. It is for that reason that when we, the Liberals, were in government, we placed restrictions on the faint hope clause so that anyone found guilty of multiple murders would not be eligible. Contrary to the claims of the Conservative government, the amendments it is proposing to make to the law will not apply to dangerous criminals such as Clifford Olson. Russell Williams also will not be able to avail himself of the faint hope clause to obtain a judicial review because of the changes made by the previous Liberal government.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250436">The faint hope clause, also known as judicial review, gives inmates who are serving a life sentence the opportunity to request a judicial review after 15 years of incarceration in order to determine whether or not they may apply for parole. Parole is not automatically granted. The application must first be heard by a jury selected from members of the community where the crime took place. If the 12 jurors unanimously agree, the inmate may apply to the National Parole Board. If the inmate proceeds, the National Parole Board determines whether the inmate, once released, may pose a risk to society or if release will contribute to his or her rehabilitation. </ParaText><ParaText id="2250437">The Liberals believe that a balance must be struck between punishment and rehabilitation in our correctional system. We would like the government to invest more in crime prevention and programs for the victims of crime. Although the faint hope clause helps make our prisons safer and contributes to the rehabilitation of offenders, we believe that access to it must be limited.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250438">The government is not taking into consideration the facts around the faint hope clause. Despite this clause, someone convicted of premeditated murder in Canada serves 28 years in prison on average. That is longer than in any other country that imposes life sentences with possibility of parole, including the United States. Prison guards feel that the faint hope clause helps keep them safe. The Correctional Investigator of Canada believes that the current faint hope clause serves the purpose for which it was conceived.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250439">The Liberals proposed amendments to the Conservative bill in response to calls from various victims' groups. These groups told us that they live in a constant state of anxiety because of the faint hope clause, so we amended the bill to require that the Commissioner of the Correctional Service of Canada notify victims when an inmate applies for judicial review of his case. The commissioner already notifies victims' families when an inmate applies for judicial review. But under the current law, the commissioner is not required to notify victims' families when an inmate does not apply. Under the bill, once the inmate's opportunity to apply has passed, he must wait five years before reapplying.</ParaText>

I am puzzled by that.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250442">We also proposed a second amendment that would extend the 90-day period for applying for a judicial review to a maximum of 180 days when the judge feels that extraordinary circumstances beyond the inmate's control prevented him from applying within the 90-day period.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250443">I will stop here, because I see that my time is up.

With regard to the amendments, we supported the changes made at committee but now the government is trying to reverse those changes. One change is the deletion of the short title. The second change deals with the amount of time, which was very short and still is, an individual who was looking to apply for this would be given in order to make the application. The third change was a response to an issue of victims rights and sharing information with the families of murder victims and perhaps more extended members, loved ones and friends.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250458">I will go through those three amendments one at a time, but before I do, it is important that at every opportunity we get we make it clear to those who are opposed to getting rid of this legislation and this regime that Canada has at the present time the longest sentences served, not given but served, in the world, with the exception of a very small category in the United States. </ParaText><ParaText id="2250459">In the United States, where people are sentenced to life as a result of a murder, first degree murder in most cases, are granted the opportunity to get parole but they only serve 18.5 years. In Canada, people who are convicted of first degree murder serve 28.5 years.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250460">In the United States there is a category where people can be sentenced to life imprisonment with no possibility of parole. It does not happen very often but there are cases like that. Even in those cases, however, the average person in the United States who is convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life with no opportunity for parole ever, only spends 29 years in prison and then, on average, die in prison at year 29.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250461">We heard this from practically everyone who works in this area and we heard the question being put to the Conservatives on the justice committee. They wanted to know where the problem was and where we were going with this legislation? The only answer was that it would make it less onerous on the families of victims of murder to be faced with the likelihood that they will need to go repeatedly before a judge to defend why the person should not be given the faint hope clause opportunity.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250462"> Then again, here are the facts. We have had 3 cases in the 4,715 either first or second degree murder cases where people applied more than once under the faint hope clause. Out of the 4,715 cases since this faint hope clause came into effect, the people who were eligible to apply for the faint hope clause, we had 3 applications. That is what this bill will do away with.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250463">The other reality is that the average person who was released under the faint hope clause in 2009, the average sentence the person served was 25 years.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2250464">Even though we hear of reinstating this title of truth in sentencing, that they do serious time for the most serious crime, they are doing that time. If we were to look at the last five years, not just 2009, we would see that the average person was released under the faint hope clause after about 23 to 23.5 years.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250465">The Conservatives have run around the country stirring up emotion and scaring the families and close ones of murdered victims by telling them that they will be faced with repeated applications every two years, which is what the law allows now. They have been told that every two years they will be before a judge or a judge and jury, or before the Parole Board and they will have to relive the crime. That is simply not true. As I said before, there have been three cases where there has been a second application. By the way, there was only a second application in those three cases. There has never been a case where a person has applied more than twice.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250466">Therefore, this fear that every two years, from the 15th year when a person can first apply under the current law in a first degree murder case, until the 25th year when people could theoretically be faced with this, if my math is correct, five times, there has never been more than three cases, and that has only occurred on the second application three times. However, this fear is stoked and the Conservatives repeat it and repeat it.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250467">My colleague from Winnipeg was telling me that Tom Flanagan, the mentor of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the guy who suggested that Assange should be assassinated, was quoted in one of as saying that it does not have to be true what one is saying, it just has to be believable, which t is what this is about. This is believable because it is in the law that a person can apply every two years from the 15-year mark in first degree murder. Of course, if one is a multiple murderer, he or she cannot apply until the 25th year under the Parole Act. However, the Conservatives continue to say it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250468">We have witnesses who come before us out of fear. We had the ombudsman come before us and she recounted the stories of victims she has been in touch with. One of their fears was to wake up at around the 15-year mark and worry that for the next 10 years, every two years they will be faced with an application. Does anybody within the correction system, the justice department or the government tell them that is not what will o happen and never has happened? No. However, the Conservatives' minions run around the country saying that this is what people will be up against. They tell people who have suffered the tremendous loss of a family member that they will be faced with this every two years. That is absolutely false.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250469">I want to speak to one of the amendments being proposed here. The reason the majority of the justice committee deleted the phony title was that it did not reflect the reality of what happens in Canada. When we are talking about a serious crime, and there is nothing more serious than murder, Canadian victims have every right to know that we keep murderers in custody longer than anybody else in the world, and that is 28.5 years on average.</ParaText>

A judge and jury under the faint hope clause as it exists now can tell inmates that they have heard their application, that they will never get out and that they do not need apply again. They can do that right now and, in fact, have done it with Clifford Olson the one time he applied.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250481">The Parole Board should be given the same jurisdiction so that we could then tell the families of the victims of murderers that the person was allowed to apply for parole, at this point it would be at 25 years, the individual was turned down and was told never to apply again or not to apply for another 10 years. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250482"> I want to be very clear on this for my friend from <Affiliation DbId="128784" Type="2">Yukon</Affiliation>.

The families are oftentimes left in ignorance and then the Conservative Party plays on those fears.

Second reading</ProceduralText><ParaText id="2250519"> moved that Bill <Document DbId="4626971" Type="3">C-43, An Act to enact the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Labour Relations Modernization Act and to amend the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts</Document>, be read the second time and referred to a committee. </ParaText><ParaText id="2250520"> He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address the bill before us today. As background, I think I join all members of Parliament in saying how much we appreciate the men and women of the RCMP who have for generations, and continue to, served Canadians from coast to coast. They have done that with professionalism, with courage, with commitment and with dedication. From the most remote areas of our country to highly urbanized settings, the RCMP has been there for us and continues to be. Citizens recognize and appreciate that from coast to coast. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250521">I especially learned more about the RCMP and its workings in a previous portfolio, public safety. During that time, my appreciation for the RCMP and the work which it did only grew. In fact, I had a great opportunity to see how the RCMP was recognized, not just nationally but internationally, as a policing force and as a police organization that had demonstrated time and time again that it had the professionalism, the dedication and the commitment to do the job that Canadians had come to know and respect and to appreciate.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250522">No organization is beyond having an inward look. No organization performs perfectly 100% all the time. That is certainly true of this chamber in which we now stand and even of the occasional political party. It has been known that 100% perfection is not always achieved.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250523">It was an honour for me, as one of a number of highlights with the RCMP and my involvement with it, to preside over the first ever appointment of a female commissioner of the RCMP, particularly in a difficult time. She did an admiral job and had the resounding support of members throughout the organization. I was also able to preside over the appointment of the first ever non-RCMP officer to the appointment of commissioner. Therefore, the RCMP has shown that it is, in many ways, a modern organization facing the challenges of international crime, national crime, modernization on a technological basis and in virtually every other level.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250524">A year ago, April 6, a court ruling in the Ontario Superior Court looked at the labour management regime of the RCMP. Presently the labour management regime has a staff relations representative program, one that was contested in court in terms of its constitutionality as recently as 1999. In fact, the constitutionality of the labour relations setup in the RCMP withstood that constitutional challenge.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250525">The RCMP, as we would all know here, is the only police force in Canada that is not unionized. It was more or less on that basis that a challenge was taken to the Ontario court, which came to a conclusion that it was not constitutional for RCMP members to be represented in this present manner because it had not yet fully allowed them the choice of having a collective bargaining process that would be recognized as a union-based process. Therefore, the court said that the present regime was not constitutional.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250526"> Now people may debate that back and forth. Even within this chamber there may be different views on that, but that was the ruling of the court. The court wisely put an 18 month stay on its decision because it said that if we declared April 6, 2009 to be the day that the present staff relations representative program was null and void, there would be the possibility for a high degree of chaos within the organization.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2250527">Individual groups could spring up all around the country. We could even have the possibility of an organization represented by a number of unions or a number of different organizations. Therefore, the Ontario court said that it would stay this for 18 months, until something was in place that would meet the demand of the court.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250528">The government appealed that, for a number of reasons. One of the main reasons was there was another case at the Supreme Court of Canada, the Fraser case. The outcome would have some direct bearing on this one. Therefore, the Government of Canada appealed the Ontario ruling and asked for that to be taken into consideration.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250529"> The courts ruled favourably on the federal government's appeal on that. The present situation is this will be addressed 30 days after the result of the ruling on the Fraser case by the Supreme Court of Canada. We will have to wait to see when that happens. We do not have a date for that as it is at the pleasure of the Supreme Court.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250530">However, there has to be an immediate vehicle in place, should the rulings go in such a way that the Ontario ruling is upheld and the present labour relations regime is upheld as being unconstitutional, to allow RCMP members to decide what type of labour management regime will work best for them.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250531">I want to make it clear. The modernization act before us is not an act which would force or require unionization of the RCMP. It is an act that would meet the demand of the court and say that certain provisions would have to be followed, certain constitutional guarantees of representation by members would be put in place, but it would leave that choice to RCMP members. That is the nub of the issue.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250532">The act looks at modernizing a number of other areas also. The entire grievance and disciplinary process in the RCMP needs to be addressed. Right now, the way it is set up, members do not have available to them certain elements of appeal within a grievance process that other members of similar organizations have. This would put in place in the Public Service Labour Relations Board certain abilities for the board to appoint adjudicators. It would allow for disputes or grievances to be addressed early on where members could be face to face with others in the grievance process to look at a possible early resolution of a grievance matter.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250533">Right now, members who face a disciplinary process may have to wait months, in fact, even longer than that, sometimes years, before the resolution of a particular grievance. That is not a fair process to have members going through, having a decision or a cloud hanging over not just their head but possibly their careers for an interminable amount of time. This would speed that process up and would allow for some early intervention and possible early resolution.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250534">There are a number of grievance and disciplinary-related areas in the particular modernization that would to assist the public and assist RCMP members.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250535">Also some changes would be foreseen on the part of the commissioner, whomever the commissioner of the day might be. Presently deputy heads of organizations within government have available to them the levers and the mechanisms to take disciplinary action and also to allow for rewards. That is fairly limited in the present legal situation related to the commissioner. Therefore, there would be some provisions that would allow the commissioner to act with the responsibility that would be commensurate with that position.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250536">The staff relations representatives, certainly the ones I have known and have worked with previously as minister, and I am sure members in the House work with on a local basis, have served with sincerity and with commitment, always looking to the best interest of their members.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2250537">This particular legislation is not a reflection on the way they have performed the tasks which the members have asked them to perform. As I said earlier, it is a reflection on the court ruling which is demanding a change. The decision will ultimately rest in the hands of the members themselves, and that is the way it should be.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250538">Adjustments will be made to the past process of pay and having a pay council making recommendations. There will be an external advisory capacity. A number of areas will be directly affected, which are in place, should members here agree. I believe there is some support for having this legislation in place pending a final ruling so that whatever happens the members of the RCMP, the men and women who have committed their lives to keeping us safe, to serving us as admirably as they do, will have the assurance that a mechanism will be in place that will not leave their concerns unattended whichever way the final ruling in court goes. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250539">That is what we have before us today. I would invite careful analysis of this particular modernization act. I hope that we will find support for it. This is being done in a non-partisan way because the interests and the safety and security of our communities, our families, our businesses are paramount at this point in time. I believe members on all sides will see it this way and that is what I anticipate as the bill moves forward.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

In any variety of these job classifications individuals may find themselves as public servants or civilian members. </ParaText><ParaText id="2250543">They are being consulted. We want input from them. We do not see a change at this point. This legislation would not affect people within the public sector union who are working with and for the RCMP right now.

They are individuals with specialized training, skill sets that are unique to the RCMP and its environment. She also said that civilian members are required to work various hours during the day, often on short notice, to meet investigational demands or court deadlines. They may be transferred or dispatched in the event of an emergency, disaster, special events such as the Olympics and the G8, or to fill shortages in resources. She is very concerned about what is going to happen to them under this new regime.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250547">I am wondering why the government has not been able to clarify some of that in advance of where we are right now with this bill.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The Supreme Court will have something to say on this in the ancillary case, the Fraser case, but it is to do with the labour management regime and the process by which members are represented.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250549">That is why the primary focus of this is to have in place the legislation that would make sure that representation for members continues, depending on how this ruling goes. That is why civilian members who in many cases do have very specific training and expertise, which my colleague mentioned, are called on in ways in which perhaps somebody under a public sector union may not be called upon. We want to make sure that they also will have full representation and consultation. </ParaText>

In fact, I would say for the member opposite, it can be stated that what we are putting in place actually will improve their situation, because the types of members he is referring to fall under certain grievance and disciplinary procedures which have been seen as somewhat limiting for an employee.

We believe that the commissioner should be fully responsible, just as a deputy minister has responsibility, although it is not a direct 100% comparison, over employees, the implementation of the various policies that affect employees, and how to move expeditiously if some of those processes are not being followed. There is a limitation right now. Just as employees themselves and RCMP members in disciplinary and grievance processes need a little more leeway and need to be able to access more broadly the types of assistance that somebody under a grievance process would have, there has to be a balanced right and responsibility at the level of commissioner. Those are laid out in the bill itself. </ParaText><ParaText id="2250555">These are seen as natural, evolutionary steps in the modernization of a labour management regime.

Stockwell Day</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2250559">Mr. Speaker, the numbers change from month to month but we could use a rough number of about 24,000 people who would be called RCMP members, depending on the fluctuation in hiring that takes place. For instance, over the last almost three years we have put in place the funding to hire 1,500 more RCMP officers all across the country. Whenever that happens there are a certain number of civilian members that have to back up those particular jobs. Overall there are about 24,000 and somewhere between 3,000 and 4,000 would be classified as civilian members.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250560">When a court rules, there is no consultation per se and the court makes a ruling. All parties affected look at it. The principal focus of the ruling is to have a provision in place pending our appeal. If the ruling stands, there would be no effective representation or a staked out framework for representation for any members, be they uniform members or civilian members. That is the principal focus.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250561">As a member of Parliament, I have certainly met with civilian members and have heard some of their concerns. I am sure other MPs have done that also. We want to make sure this is in place and that members, as my friend has mentioned, should go through their own associations to get in their views. This is generally seen as very favourable to all members in terms of protecting them and giving them a greater say in their own affairs.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250562">This is not seen in any way to be limiting any of their freedoms, rights or responsibilities. Certainly at the committee stage we would welcome hearing from members of Parliament who may have heard from some civilian members who may think that is not the case.

This legislation, if enacted, would give the RCMP's membership the choice of whether or not they want to unionize and be represented by a bargaining agent.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250565">In my opinion, the membership of the RCMP deserves the choice to make an informed decision as to whether or not a union is the best way in which to represent their views and negotiate on their behalf.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250566">At present, the RCMP is the only police force in Canada not represented by an association. Looking at other police associations across Canada, we can see that they have worked quite well and have given police officers a strong voice, whether it has been fighting for improved working conditions or the gun registry, for example.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250567">One thing that is important to keep in mind is that this legislation would not allow the RCMP the ability to strike. Just as it would with other police associations and emergency service personnel, a strike would greatly risk the safety and security of Canadians. A union or an association would exist to bargain on members' needs and members' behalf and represent their views to management.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250568"> Whether or not the RCMP should form an association is a longstanding issue, and there are arguments on both sides. Organizations such as the Mounted Police Association of Ontario and the British Columbia Mounted Police Professional Association have been vocal supporters of unionization.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250569">They took this matter to court, and on April 6 of last year an Ontario Superior Court judge ruled that section 96 of the RCMP regulations breached the freedom of association guaranteed by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250570">The conclusion was that Canada's 20,000 RCMP officers have the right to decide whether they should or should not unionize. That is a choice I believe they deserve to make and are best suited to make.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250571">Now on the other side of that argument, there are some valid issues being raised. There are some individuals within the civilian membership of the RCMP who have expressed concerns. They worry that a future union could lump them in with the officers and that their unique issues and needs may not be appropriately represented.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250572"> That is a valid concern and something we should explore in greater detail at the committee stage by having witnesses from all sides come forward to explain their views.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250573">I have before me a letter that was written by the staff relations representative, Steve Raine, chair of the SRR national staffing committee, who raised a number of concerns. Under the category of employee review, which is currently being undertaken by senior management, he indicates in this letter that there has been this type of review in 1995, 1998, 2001, 2004, as well as 2007, and they are under the understanding that it is again being reviewed.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250574">The civilian members feel that not only is it a waste of taxpayer dollars because, of course, it has been reviewed so many times but also the reclassification that could occur as a result would have a serious impact on the operational efficiency of the RCMP and could jeopardize public safety.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250575">They raise this issue of the category of employee review because they also feel it is causing great unease with the regular members at a time when Bill <Document DbId="4626971" Type="3">C-43</Document> is also potentially going to dramatically change the entire system of staff representation.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250576">The regular members do not want to be treated like every other police force in the country. The civilian members do not want to be viewed as simply public servants. The letter says, “The RCMP is unique and it is our membership—regular and civilian—that makes it so”.</ParaText>

There has been concern expressed because of some of the changes that have occurred under the commissioner in the last number of years, and a thorough review of those powers needs to be conducted because we do not want to do something in haste that would cause more concern and more grievance within the RCMP.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250581">The commissioner would also be granted the authority to implement a structured discipline system that would attempt to bring more transparency, consistency and efficiency when dealing with conduct resolution. These changes would be consistent with the discipline systems found throughout other Canadian police services and the rest of the public service. </ParaText><ParaText id="2250582">It is something that needs to be thoroughly investigated at committee stage. We have heard some of the concerns through media reports, including concerns from a whistleblower, on some of these changes to the RCMP and things that have occurred over the last number of years. These powers need to be thoroughly reviewed.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250583">The bill would also establish a total compensation advisory committee, which would provide recommendations to the Treasury Board president on overall compensation of RCMP members not represented by a bargaining agent. A consultation committee would be created to address workplace issues. Members would be given the opportunity to bring their views and concerns directly to managers either individually or as a group. This could include discussing potential workplace improvements or identifying areas of concern. It is just one more way in which communication within the RCMP could be improved.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250584">A public service relations board would be created to act as an independent, external third party, which would make final and binding decisions relating to discipline and grievance issues of the RCMP members. Some issues would not be referable. These would be grievances related to the assignment of duties, law enforcement techniques or uniform standards. Such a board would have to take into account the unique role the RCMP plays as Canada's national police organization protecting Canadians from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250585">Bill <Document DbId="4626971" Type="3">C-43</Document> is not a small piece of legislation. It is 116 pages filled with clauses that could make significant changes to the structure and operation of the RCMP. Therefore, we must ensure an in-depth study at committee stage to allow witnesses the opportunity to voice their support, concerns and general opinions. For instance, the new powers that would be granted to the commissioner, as I indicated earlier, must be studied further to ensure transparency and accountability. </ParaText><ParaText id="2250586">I look forward to hearing further debate on this bill from all of my colleagues and from witnesses at committee stage. The men and women of the RCMP deserve to decide for themselves whether they feel adequately represented or whether an association would better their working conditions.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250587">As I said earlier, some of the background on the development of Bill <Document DbId="4626971" Type="3">C-43</Document> deserves mention. Bill <Document DbId="4626971" Type="3">C-43, An Act to enact the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Labour Relations Modernization Act and to amend the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts</Document>, was introduced in the House of Commons by the hon. <Affiliation DbId="147110" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> in June of this year.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250588">Bill C-43 is a direct response to an April 2009 decision, over a year later, by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, which found that section 96 of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Regulations breached the freedom of association accorded to RCMP members under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, a very important clause.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2250589">The decision concluded that under the charter, Canada's 20,000 RCMP officers are entitled to decide whether they wish to bargain with the force's management through a union of their choice or remain under the existing arrangement, which is ultimately under management's control.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250590">As part of the decision, the court struck down section 96, but gave the federal government 18 months to provide a new statutory framework for collective bargaining. This period was to have ended in October 2010, but at the last minute after three previously unsuccessful attempts by the government to obtain a stay of the court ruling, the Ontario Court of Appeal granted a stay lasting up to 30 days after the release of the related Supreme Court of Canada decision involving the rights of farmers to organize. The Supreme Court decision is expected some time this fall or in the spring of 2011.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250591">As I said earlier, Bill <Document DbId="4626971" Type="3">C-43</Document>, if implemented, would give RCMP members the choice of whether they want to continue to work in a non-unionized environment or pursue the unionized option where they would be represented by a certified bargaining agent. It would also give the RCMP commissioner new powers to appoint, promote, discipline, demote or terminate the employment of all members including commissioned officers, quite significant powers.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250592">It would also establish, as I said earlier, the total compensation advisory committee to provide recommendations to the <Affiliation DbId="147110" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> on the overall compensation, pay and benefits, of the RCMP members who are not represented by a certified bargaining agent. Under a unionized scenario this would include RCMP officers, for example inspectors or the ranks above, executives or other non-represented or excluded employees of the RCMP.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250593">It would also establish a consultation committee to address workplace issues. Through a series of local, divisional, regional and national consultative committees and/or working groups, members would be given the opportunity to bring their views and concerns directly to managers, either individually or as a group.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250594">The bill, if implemented, would also maintain the existing formal conflict management system whereby options would continue to be offered to resolve conflicts above and beyond the formal grievance process, such as mediation through a third party. The use of these options would be voluntary, confidential and impartial. It would also provide the commissioner with the authority to implement a structured discipline system, which would seek to resolve conduct issues transparently, consistently and promptly.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250595">RCMP members would have the right to refer certain decisions or actions of management to the Public Service Labour Relations Board, an impartial, external decision-making body. As I said, it is a very complex and lengthy bill. It would also establish a Public Service Relations Board as an independent external third party to make final and binding decisions relating to discipline issues and some grievances of the RCMP members.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250596">As I stated earlier, there have been concerns. There has been some stakeholder reaction. For example, the right of the RCMP members to unionize is a longstanding issue and various informal RCMP labour associations such as the Mounted Police Association of Ontario and the British Columbia Mounted Police Professional Association, which were the ones who brought the issue to the courts to begin with, have been particularly vocal on granting RCMP members the right to associate. As part of the temporary court-ordered stay, these groups have also been given access to the RCMP's email system as well as its intranet and intranet bulletin boards to post information about the benefits of unionization. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250597">There have been many pieces of correspondence that have been sent out by these associations to ensure that members of the RCMP have been apprised of their rights. In fact in a member communication, they talk about the historic reason why they have been forbidden to do this and that they really do feel that collective bargaining is essential for members of the RCMP. They talk about collective bargaining simply referring to work-related negotiations between an employer and group of employees that has members of the association permitted to negotiate on their behalf.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2250598">They talk about some of the successes that these associations have been able to achieve. For example, police associations in Canada succeeded in improving the lives of their members, as they say in their correspondence, and they talk about the elimination of voluntary overtime. In negotiations, for example, in mid-2000, the Toronto Police Association fought to retain an existing minimum staffing requirement of two officers per patrol car. They talk about the Police Association of Nova Scotia, which recently defended its members against a pension deficiency. They talk about the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary from my own riding introducing the public awareness campaign that resulted in an increase in the force's budget, which resulted in the hiring of more officers and improvements in training.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250599">They list these types of achievements of the bond of association, and say that if the RCMP felt so inclined they feel that these associations would be able to bring forward positive changes on their behalf.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250600">They have been bringing forward this issue, speaking not only very strongly in the court-related process but also to members of Parliament on these very serious issues that they feel need to be addressed.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250601">Again, I bring the House back to the staff relations representatives who have an alternate view. They feel that we should rethink this whole move toward an association by the RCMP or at least give them the opportunity to voice their concerns on these matters and give them the opportunity to say why they should not be included in this group or association, why they are concerned about some of the issues around the category of employee review.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250602">In conclusion, I would like to say that I think the bill provides a new labour relations regime for the RCMP, that it should go to committee for further review and further analysis, that we need a fulsome discussion about this issue, bringing forward some of the internal concerns of the RCMP, some of the staff relations concerns, and as well giving the RCMP members and officers themselves an opportunity to come forward with why they feel it may be to their benefit or not to their benefit to come forward in this manner.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250603">I think we also need a full discussion on some of the review panels and the tribunals that are going to be created under this act. I think as well that we have to consider the powers of the commissioner and whether or not they are at the right level of powers, the right actions at this particular time, and how we can move forward to ensure that the RCMP, that most respected institution, is given even a greater opportunity.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

At least this bill does address the fact that the RCMP has a choice as to whether or not they want to form an association. The RCMP had to go through the court process, associations had to bring forward these issues and I believe the Toronto police had to bring forward these issues to the courts. It is unfortunate that particular point was delayed. It is about choice.

The Bloc will be pleased to discuss and debate this bill in committee with its usual thoroughness.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250636">The Bloc believes that unionization of Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers would lead to more harmonious and fairer labour relations. In addition, it is useful to remember that the Conservatives introduced this bill following an Ontario Provincial Court decision, which was appealed by the government three times.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250637">In April 2009, Justice Ian MacDonnell of the Ontario Superior Court extended the right to unionize to the 22,000 officers in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The judge ruled that the federal law governing the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which prohibits unionization, is unconstitutional. However, police cannot strike because the Canadian Police Association gave up that right.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250638">This decision put an end to a century-old tradition of RCMP management believing that unionization would hurt the officers' morale. This is not the first time that RCMP officers have requested the right to unionize. In 1999, the Supreme Court of Canada threw out the case of Gaétan Delisle, a former officer who invoked the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to allow RCMP members to unionize.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250639">This bill introduces human resources management processes for grievance procedures, disciplinary measures and the review of conditions of employment. It also gives the commissioner authorities similar to those given to deputy heads in the federal public service as well as the heads of large police services to support the effective management of the RCMP workforce.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250640">According to the new labour relations regime, RCMP members will be able to choose to work in a non-unionized environment, enabled through joint consultation, or to work in a unionized environment, represented by a certified bargaining agent. As is the case with most police forces in Canada, RCMP members would not be able to withdraw their services.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250641"> In either a unionized or a non-unionized environment, the new labour relations regime for the RCMP would include the following features.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250642">The proposed legislation gives the commissioner human resource management authorities similar to those of deputy heads in the federal public service—as I said earlier—and to those of heads of large police services in Canada. This includes the authority to appoint, promote, discipline, demote or terminate the employment of all members, including commissioned officers.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250643">The President of the Treasury Board will establish a total compensation advisory committee to provide him with recommendations on overall compensation, that is, pay and benefits, for RCMP members who are not represented by a certified bargaining agent.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250644">If members choose not to be represented by a bargaining agent, the total compensation advisory committee's recommendations would apply to all RCMP members.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250645">If members choose to be represented by a bargaining agent, the committee's recommendations would only apply to officers, that is, inspectors and ranks above, executives and other non-represented or excluded employees of the RCMP.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2250646">The committee would be comprised of up to five impartial and external members who, together, would have an appropriate mix of knowledge of policing operations and of compensation issues and principles.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250647">The total compensation advisory committee shares many similarities with the advisory committee on senior level retention and compensation, which provides, among other things, independent advice and recommendations to the President of the Treasury Board on compensation and overall human resources management matters for executives, deputy ministers, chief executive officers of crown corporations and other Governor in Council appointees.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250648">The proposed legislation requires, among other things, that a consultation committee be established to address workplace issues. This could include the co-development of workplace improvements; that is to say, members could also participate in identifying and collaboratively resolving workplace issues and challenges. Through a series of local, divisional, regional and national consultative committees and working groups, members would be given the opportunity to bring their views and concerns directly to managers, either individually or as a group. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250649"> The bill maintains the current informal conflict management system and integrates it into all labour relations processes. This system will continue to offer options to resolve conflicts above and beyond the formal grievance process, such as mediation through a third party. The use of these options would be voluntary, confidential and impartial. </ParaText><ParaText id="2250650">The proposed legislation provides the commissioner with the authority to implement a restructured discipline system. Consistent with discipline systems found throughout other Canadian police services and the broader public service, the new system would ensure that the RCMP is able to address and resolve conduct issues transparently, consistently and promptly. It would give RCMP members the right to refer certain decisions or actions of management to an impartial, external decision-making body, the Public Service Labour Relations Board. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250651">The proposed legislation would include a more timely and effective grievance process. This new process would give members the right to refer certain decisions to an impartial, external, decision-making body, the Public Service Labour Relations Board. </ParaText><ParaText id="2250652">What role does the Public Service Relations Board play in the public service? The legislation proposes that the board act as an independent, external third party to make final and binding decisions relating to discipline issues and some grievances of RCMP members. Members would not be able to refer grievances to the board on issues such as assignment of duties, law enforcement techniques or uniform standards. </ParaText><ParaText id="2250653">To fulfill its role, the Public Service Labour Relations Board will take into account the unique role of the RCMP as a police organization, protecting Canadians and national safety. It will have to ensure it has to the capacity to perform its new powers and functions, including the ability to assign adjudicators who have knowledge of policing and police organizations as required. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250654">The bill is a step in the right direction but the Bloc Québécois has some concerns. There are some issues that could be debated in committee if the bill is passed here in the House. One of our concerns is the definition of “employee” found in clause 2(1). This definition is much too strict. In our opinion, there is no reason to exclude employees who are hired outside Canada, part-time employees, casual employees and students. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2250655">These people carry out the same duties as their unionized co-workers but are denied the right of association. Members will recall that the Public Service Alliance of Canada is currently before the courts in order to have the rights of these types of employees recognized under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250656">It is also worth mentioning that the so-called confidential positions are not defined clearly enough. According to clause 31 and following, people who are in confidential positions are those who have been deemed to be so by the employer. It is then up to the union to prove otherwise. This vague or extremely flexible definition could easily lead to cases of abuse that would ultimately be harmful to labour relations. </ParaText><ParaText id="2250657">The bill refers specifically to a certification process. When an application for certification is filed, the board must ensure that a majority of employees in the bargaining unit wish the applicant employee organization to represent them as their bargaining agent. This is a fairly unusual situation and, in our opinion, it places a very heavy burden on the shoulders of the employee organization.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250658">Subsection 29(2) of the Canada Labour Code sets out a mechanism similar to that provided for under section 28 of the Quebec Labour Code. This mechanism involves a representation vote when the board is satisfied that the union has obtained the support of 35% or more of the employees.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250659">In our view, this is a much more realistic approach to truly determining what the employees want. It allows for a vote, when everyone has their say. </ParaText><ParaText id="2250660">Upon reading the bill and the rulings that led to it, we have to wonder what opportunity members of the RCMP will have to join an existing union. The unclear provision, in our opinion, is clause 56 of the bill. We wonder whether its purpose is to ensure that the employee organization actively defends its members or whether it is to limit the organization's role to defending police officers only.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250661">Clause 56 states that:</ParaText><ParaText id="2250662"><LegislationQuote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The Board must revoke the certification of an employee organization as the bargaining agent for the bargaining unit if the Board, on application by the employer or any employee, determines that the organization no longer has as its primary mandate the representation of police officers.</QuotePara></LegislationQuote></ParaText><ParaText id="2250663">In our opinion, the first solution should be adopted. With the exception of three Canadian provinces, all the other jurisdictions allow their police officers to be part of diversified employee organizations.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250664">As I was saying at the beginning of my speech, this is a step in the right direction. The Bloc Québécois notes, however, that everything in this bill is geared to limiting the number of individuals who can join the ranks of an employee organization. Whether it be by excluding employees whose jobs are not very secure, or by designating confidential positions, there seems to be a real desire to give a limited number of people the right to organize.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250665">What is more, having a certification process that is different from what is done under the Canada Labour Code and in other provinces shows the government's desire to make the certification process difficult.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2250666">The confusion around a number of definitions and clauses in the bill also reflects the government's attitude. We sincerely believe that with some amendments, Bill <Document DbId="4626971" Type="3">C-43</Document> would benefit RCMP employees. In committee, we will be able to question witnesses and move and debate amendments.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250667">Needless to say, I do not believe the government was too happy about introducing this bill. I do not get the feeling the Conservatives like unions much. I think they moved second reading of this bill quite reluctantly. In their plan to help the auto sector, the Conservatives wanted to include a condition that would have imposed a salary reduction, in spite of the collective agreements in effect.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250668">I have another example to back up what I am saying. In the 2009 budget, the Conservatives included an amendment to the collective agreement for public service employees that unilaterally imposed new salary conditions on some public servants.

They also voted against Bill <Document DbId="3890441" Type="4">C-395</Document> introduced by the Bloc Québécois, which would exclude the period of a labour dispute from the employment insurance qualifying period. This bill is designed to fill a gap that, in theory, could be used by an employer to pressure a union.</ParaText>

The last time it came up, it was studied by the Standing Committee on Public Accounts. We were told of a problematic and distressing situation for many members of the RCMP. Senior officials had been involved in an embezzlement scheme. Several years ago, they had taken money out of an insurance plan and put it into a retirement plan, or vice versa. The Standing Committee on Public Accounts made a number of comments and recommendations on the matter. According to one of the recommendations, unionizing RCMP members would diminish the risk of such situations happening again and would correct them before they ever happened.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250673">I would like to hear what my colleague has to say about this situation in particular.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The government was forced, in a way, to introduce this bill. It is not pleased about it and has its doubts. We know that the Conservatives are no friend of the unions and do everything possible to limit their ability to intervene. Therefore, the bill before us, with over one hundred clauses, must be analyzed and debated with fairness and rigour to provide RCMP officers with appropriate and effective working conditions and representation. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Within that core is the essential function of an opposition MP to hold a government to account. I will submit that my ability to hold the government to account has been impaired by the <Affiliation DbId="111559" Type="4">Minister of International Cooperation</Affiliation> and her <Affiliation DbId="163759" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation>, who advertently misled Parliament by telling Parliament something that was not true. I will be asking you, Mr. Speaker, to make a prima facie finding that a breach of privilege has occurred.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250978">Specifically, the <Affiliation DbId="111559" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> and her <Affiliation DbId="163759" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> “deliberately attempted to mislead the House by way of a statement”, and that is taken from O'Brien and Bosc, or in this case a series of statements, and that she and he knew or ought to have known that their statements to the House were either false or an attempt to mislead. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250979">For some time now, I and others have been asking questions about KAIROS' defunding. KAIROS is a church-based non-governmental organization that represents seven of Canada's largest religious denominations working on a range of social justice issues. Its funding was up for review and it had submitted the appropriate application. It was told that it was being reviewed favourably.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250980">Then the rumours to the contrary started to be heard. KAIROS was unfairly slandered as being anti-Semitic by the <Affiliation DbId="128705" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism</Affiliation>. The minister has since withdrawn his remarks. It was then slandered as being anti-mining when all it was trying to do was improve the lives of indigenous people living in poverty.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250981">In question after question, the <Affiliation DbId="111559" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> and her <Affiliation DbId="163759" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> said that KAIROS did not meet CIDA's funding priorities. On October 28, 2010, the <Affiliation DbId="111559" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> stated:</ParaText>

							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="2250983">On April 23 the parliamentary secretary said:</ParaText><ParaText id="2250984"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The criteria for the funding for KAIROS is the same as the criteria for funding for anyone else applying for such funding. KAIROS did not meet the criteria. It did not get the funding. There is no surprise there.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2250985">On March 15 the parliamentary secretary said:</ParaText><ParaText id="2250986">
								<Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">CIDA thoroughly analyzed KAIROS' program proposal and determined, with regret, that it did not meet the agency's current priorities. This is important.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2250987">However, despite these statements which indicate that KAIROS was defunded because it did not fit within the priorities of the government, there are two pieces of evidence to show that this is false. The first is the access to information request, the response for which I would like to table with you today for your consideration, Mr. Speaker. The second is a transcript from the foreign affairs and international development committee from December 9, 2010, which I will also submit.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250988">When looking through the recommendation produced by CIDA for the minister, obtained through the access to information request, contrary to the parliamentary secretary's and the minister's statements in the House, the only conclusion that can be drawn is that CIDA makes an unequivocal recommendation in support of $7.1 million funding for KAIROS, on the signature approval page of this document, which reads as follows:</ParaText><ParaText id="2250989"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Recommendation: that you sign below to indicate your approval of a contribution of $7,098,758 over four years for the above program.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250990">However, someone has inserted the word “not”. This one handwritten change completely inverts the recommendation. Let me read it again so that the new meaning is clear, “Recommendation: that you sign below to indicate you not approve a contribution of $7,098,758 over four years for the above program”.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250991">There is no name or initials next to the handwritten “not”. After this line are three signatures: that of Margaret Biggs, the president of CIDA; Naresh Singh, vice-president of CIDA; and the <Affiliation DbId="111559" Type="4">Minister of International Cooperation</Affiliation>. A reasonable person looking at the end page would reasonably conclude that all three did not approve of the grant. I submit that this is precisely what the government, the minister and the parliamentary secretary want the reader to believe. They want to develop a narrative that KAIROS did not meet the standards and priorities of the agency, when in fact it did, and that the agency had killed the proposal. Their responses are tailored to establishing that narrative, and that narrative, I submit, is misleading.</ParaText><ParaText id="2250992">In testimony before the foreign affairs and international development committee, Ms. Biggs testified that when both she and Mr. Singh signed the document, the “not” was not there. She further confirmed to the committee that the department had recommended KAIROS for funding, contrary to what the minister and her parliamentary secretary stated to the House. Had the access to information request not been submitted, that misleading narrative would have been sustained.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2250993">I practised law for 22 years, and I can assure the House that any lawyer would not allow such a significant change, let alone a fundamental change to be made to a $7 million document without all three signatories initialling the change. But it gets worse. I will read from the transcript of Thursday, December 9, at the meeting of the foreign affairs committee:</ParaText><ParaText id="2250994">Member: “Madam Minister, you just said that you signed off. You were the one”</ParaText><ParaText id="2250995">Minister: “I sign off on all of the documents”. </ParaText><ParaText id="2250996">Member: “You were the one who wrote the 'not'”. </ParaText><ParaText id="2250997">Minister: “I did not say I was the one who wrote the 'not'”. </ParaText><ParaText id="2250998">Member: “Who did, then?”</ParaText><ParaText id="2250999"> Minister: “I do not know.” </ParaText><ParaText id="2251000">Member: “You don't know?” </ParaText><ParaText id="2251001">Minister: “I do not know.” </ParaText><ParaText id="2251002">Member: “That's a remarkable statement.”</ParaText><ParaText id="2251003">At this point my jaw was hitting the floor:</ParaText>

Is there some override to the minister's decision?” </ParaText><ParaText id="2251008">It goes on:</ParaText><ParaText id="2251009">Member: “So there's a reasonable possibility that you signed off on this, and that someone put a 'not' in later.”</ParaText><ParaText id="2251010">Further on:</ParaText><ParaText id="2251011">Member: “It may well, but you just said that you didn't put the 'not' in. I'm assuming your president of CIDA didn't put the 'not' in. There's only one other signatory who didn't put the 'not' in. So somehow or another, a 'not' got put in after possibly all three of you recommended the KAIROS' funding”.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251012">Further on:</ParaText><ParaText id="2251013">Member: “Madam Minister, clearly somebody didn't get the memo on priorities because clearly Madam Biggs or the other person to the signatory sent the memo up to you from September through to November. They sent that memo to you, you sat on it for two months, that's fine. That's not an issue. The issue is that they didn't seem to understand what your priorities were, so they didn't get the memo as to what the priorities were. If this reflects government priorities, why is it that the president of CIDA doesn't know what the priorities of the government are?”</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251014">I will not carry on with the rest of the interaction between the minister and me, but I just point out that later, and just as concerning, under questioning, the minister could not even say whether or not she had signed this document, if it is an auto-signature or otherwise. In my mind, this should concern us all. If she did approve, why could she not sign the document itself?</ParaText><ParaText id="2251015">We are all aware of the doctrine of ministerial accountability which can be summed up by saying that the buck stops on the minister's desk. Apparently it does not with this <Affiliation DbId="111559" Type="4">minister</Affiliation>. Neither she, nor you, Mr. Speaker, nor I, nor this House knows who makes final CIDA decisions.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251016">In order to establish a prima facie finding that a breach of privilege and contempt has occurred, three elements must be present: one, it must be proven that the statements were misleading; two, it must be established that the member at the time knew the statement was incorrect; and three, in the making of the statement, the minister intended to mislead the House. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251017">On page 111 of the 22nd edition of <I>Erskine May</I> it states:</ParaText><ParaText id="2251018"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The Commons may treat the making of a deliberately misleading statement as a contempt.</QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText><ParaText id="2251019">Page 234 of the second edition of Maingot's <I> Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I> explains that in order for a Speaker to find a prima facie case in a matter involving a deliberate misleading statement, there must be “an admission by someone in authority, such as a minister of the Crown or an officer of a department”.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251020">On Friday, December 9, I gave the <Affiliation DbId="111559" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> the opportunity to retract these statements and possibly clear the record. However, she refused to do so, conduct which is inconsistent with the standards of the House and what the public expects from its members.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251021">She further compounded her difficulties by saying, “The minister ultimately decides what course to take”. That statement is patently false. The transcript of the foreign affairs committee says that she not only did not insert the “not”, she does not know who did. Somebody is making decisions over there, but it is not the minister.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251022">Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to remind you of the three requirements needed to establish contempt. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251023">One, it must be proven that her statements were misleading. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251024">We have three statements which are recorded in <I>Hansard</I>, one on October 28, one on April 23 and one on March 15, which directly contradict both the documents obtained through the access to information request and the testimony of Margaret Biggs before the foreign affairs committee. Both show that the <Affiliation DbId="111559" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> was informed by the president of CIDA, that CIDA had recommended KAIROS for funding and that it did meet the standards and priorities of CIDA, the government, and yet the minister and her parliamentary secretary misled the House into believing that her officials had decided that KAIROS did not meet the standards and that the funding had been turned down by CIDA.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251025">Two, it must be established that the member at the time knew the statement was incorrect. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="30">(1530)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2251026">The <Affiliation DbId="111559" Type="4">Minister of International Cooperation</Affiliation> was fully briefed on CIDA's position on funding of KAIROS, which has been proven both in the testimony before the foreign affairs committee and in the documentation obtained through the access to information request. Furthermore, in Ms. Biggs' testimony before the foreign affairs committee she stated that she had recommended to the minister that KAIROS receive the funding and that there was “no confusion on that matter”. She even went so far as to say that “My discussions with the minister were quite clear. She did, as she indicated, deliberate on it. She knew what my advice was so she was not misled in any way”.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251027">Third, in making the statement the minister intended to mislead the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251028"> On three separate occasions over a period of eight months the minister and her parliamentary secretary stood in this place and repeated mistruths about the reason why KAIROS funding was denied. This was an intentional narrative and sustainable if the access to information report had not been made. I hope, Mr. Speaker, that you would agree this represents a prima facie intent to mislead the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251029">May I remind the House that this is a $7 million grant, an enormous sum of money for the people and organizations involved, and the good that it could do.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251030">At this point, we have a document that contradicts the minister and the parliamentary secretary and the two senior CIDA officials who contradict the parliamentary secretary and the minister. The minister, even as late as last Friday, asserted the minister ultimately decided what course to take. Apparently that is not true with the minister.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251031">One is left with a clear impression that the decision to not recommend was made after the minister's signature had been appended to the document. The minister does not know who put in the interlineations and therefore cannot tell the House who made the decision, when the decision was made and why the decision, approved by the agency and possibly by the minister herself, was reversed.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251032">It is a prima facie case of contempt to mislead members by blaming others for one's decisions. It is misleading to say that one made a decision when no decision was made. It impairs a member's core function of holding a government to account. It erodes the doctrine of ministerial accountability.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251033">In the event that you do make a finding of prima facie contempt, Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to move the requisite motion.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2251034">Mr. Speaker, at the time of these events, I was the parliamentary secretary. At this point, I am simply the member for Kootenay—Columbia.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251035">I do have some information that might be of value.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251036"> First, I take note of the three points the member brought to our attention, that the statements were misleading, that the statements were known to be misleading and that the statements were intended to mislead.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251037">If I may, Mr. Speaker, I would like to draw to your attention that at no time in the member's presentation did he make any assertion that the minister made any misleading statements. In fact, I do not doubt for a second that the member, his colleagues and his research people will have combed over every solitary word that the minister may have uttered in the House or outside of the House. I note he did not say that the minister made any statement that misled the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251038">With respect to myself, on March 15, I did make the statement that CIDA thoroughly analyzed KAIROS' program proposal and determined that it did not meet the agency's current priorities. For that, I have to apologize to the House. It was an inadvertent mistake on my part. I do apologize. As a person who has been around the House for 17 years, I take that failing on my part very seriously.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251039">Second, the member says that the responses, obviously referring to my responses, because I have clearly determined that the minister's responses were never questioned by the member in his statement just now, were tailored to forward the narrative. This falls into the category of sometimes there is a lot less than meets the eye. In this instance, I was given to the impression that CIDA, as with any agency or any ministry, should take direction from the minister. Had it taken direction from the minister on behalf of the Government of Canada, the recommendation coming to the minister would not have been to recommend. In fact, it would have been against recommending. The fault, then, lies that the agency itself was in fact giving the minister advice that did not reflect the priorities.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251040"> I was mistaken. I took a look at the priorities of the government, which by the way I fully support because it gives the government the opportunity to more correctly direct where our funding should go. My presumption on March 15 was that CIDA, as an agency, would have made that recommendation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251041">If we take a look at it, first, the minister has not been cited with any evidence by the member that she made misleading statements and second, I was wrong, I did make a mistake and I apologize to the House. The second point, though, that I knew they were misleading, I have already clearly stated I could not have known. It was simply a mistake on my part. Third, that I intended to mislead, one follows the other, does it not?</ParaText><ParaText id="2251042">With all due respect to the hon. colleague, the fact is this has been a change in policy that has been unacceptable to him, to KAIROS and to other people in that industry, and so be it. That is part of the political process and part of the discourse that we get into.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251043">In fact, there is no place for a question of privilege other than perhaps, should you, Mr. Speaker, choose to censure me as having been a little bit overzealous in my representation of what I presumed CIDA was going to be doing.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251044">In fact, there is absolutely no case for a question of privilege.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

							<ParaText id="2251051"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Mr. Speaker, we have now learned from CIDA documents obtained through access to information and reviewed by the minister one year ago, that KAIROS' objectives are in fact “strategically aligned with our country program objectives”.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2251052">The question continued:</ParaText><ParaText id="2251053"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">On September 20 of this year, the minister for CIDA, in absolute contradiction of her own department's findings said, “KAIROS was recently refused funding as it did not meet the government's priorities”.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2251054"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Now that we know the minister's pretext for the KAIROS cuts is false, will the minister now finally restore funding to this organization?</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2251055">In her response to my question, the minister said, “After due diligence, it was determined that KAIROS' proposal did not meet government standards”. Remember, now, on September 20, she said, “KAIROS was recently refused funding as it did not meet the government's priorities”. She has made this statement now at least twice.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251056">We now know both of these statements to be false. Why? Because Margaret Biggs, CIDA's president, and Naresh Singh, the vice-president for CIDA, said so on December 9 at the foreign affairs and international development committee meeting. They testified that they positively endorsed the funding application for KAIROS. In fact, CIDA staff found that the bid met their criteria, received a positive audit report and had an excellent evaluation. Accordingly CIDA staff sent the response for approval to the minister.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251057">The application approval was endorsed by CIDA's president and vice-president, as follows, “that you sign below to indicate you approve a contribution of $7,098,758 over four years for the above program”.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251058">CIDA wanted to fund KAIROS. After departmental deliberation, the president decided that funding KAIROS was the right thing to do. Therefore, it is clear to me that the department standards were met and that it fit departmental priorities.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251059">This is particularly disappointing when we review an order paper question submitted by the member for <Affiliation DbId="128271" Type="2">London North Centre</Affiliation>, which asked:</ParaText><ParaText id="2251060"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">With regard to KAIROS, which has lost its funding from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) as of November 30, 2009 due to KAIROS no longer fitting CIDA priorities: (a) what are the CIDA priorities that did not fit well with the priorities of KAIROS; (b) what sort of criteria does CIDA examine to determine whether or not a non-governmental organization will receive funding...</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2251061">In response, the minister offered the following:</ParaText><ParaText id="2251062"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Mr. Speaker, with regard to a) The CIDA decision not to continue funding KAIROS was based on the overall assessment of the proposal, not on any single criterion.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2251063">The operative words are “the CIDA decision not to continue funding KAIROS”. CIDA's decision was to continue funding KAIROS, not to discontinue its funding.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251064">The minister is clearly continuing with her subterfuge. The minister's statement is in complete contradiction to CIDA's position that it met the funding criteria. For the minister to state otherwise is misleading.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2251065">The response to question (b) is as follows: “Non-government organizations’ proposals to CIDA are assessed on a variety of criteria, which are described on CIDA’s website”.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251066">Further, any distinction the minister may try to create or imply between CIDA's criteria and the government's criteria, if she attempts to make such a distinction, are irrelevant. To find otherwise would bring into disrepute all government websites because people will no longer be able to rely upon government websites as reflecting the priorities of the government. The fact that the minister may have used the words “government standards” or “government priorities” in the House, as opposed to CIDA priorities, is therefore irrelevant because CIDA priorities represent the government's priorities and its criteria are the government's criteria.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251067">Did the minister at the time know that her statement was incorrect?</ParaText><ParaText id="2251068">On December 9, 2010, at the foreign affairs and international development committee meeting, Ms. Biggs made clear that the minister was aware of her department's position. She said, “My discussions with the minister were quite clear. She did, as she indicated, deliberate on it. She knew what my advice was. I don't know where that “not” came from, but she wasn't misled in any way”. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251069">This statement by Ms. Biggs must be considered in addition to the fact that KAIROS received a positive audit report and an excellent evaluation and that it was recommended for funding by CIDA's president and vice-president, all of which facts had to have been known to the minister.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251070">Did she intend to mislead the House? Unless a statement is made negligently, with no regard for the facts whatsoever or with no regard to the nature of the question asked whatsoever, or misleading information was given to her by her department before offering an answer, which is clearly not the case here, then one can only conclude that the answer given was intended to mislead the House. The definition of mislead, according to the Oxford Dictionary is to “cause someone to have a wrong idea or impression”.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251071">Anything stated, designed to, or with the intention of misleading the House, knowing it to be false, imports the conclusion that the person making this statement intended it to mislead or had no regard for whether it would mislead or not, which is equally contemptuous.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251072">The remarks by my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128204" Type="2">Scarborough—Guildwood</Affiliation>, as well as the information that I have presented to you, Mr. Speaker, make clear that the minister did in fact mislead the House. The statements made by Ms. Biggs in committee make clear that the minister was aware that she was incorrect in making the statements she made, and I therefore submit that the minister intended to mislead the House and its members. The minister said that KAIROS' funding was cut because CIDA did not want to fund it or that it did not meet government priorities and standards. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251073">We know this to be false. We also have demonstrated that the nuance between whether it met government priorities or standards or CIDA priorities is irrelevant as CIDA priorities must be government priorities. How can they be anything less? And if they are, then the government and not Parliament is truly dysfunctional.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251074">We now know the minister's statements to be false. We also know that the minister was aware that it was false while she was offering her justifications to the numerous questions asked of her in question period. As such I strongly believe that this provides sufficient evidence to hold the minister in contempt of the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251075">If the minister did not want to fund KAIROS then she should have explained why she did not want to provide funding instead of pinning the decision on the department she runs. I for one would still like an honest answer and I think everyone in the House and in Canada has the right to know why KAIROS was not funded.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Second reading</ProceduralText><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Davies (Vancouver Kingsway)" id="3670919"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128327" Type="2">Mr. Don Davies (Vancouver Kingsway, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2251082">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to stand on behalf of the New Democratic Party of Canada to speak in favour of Bill <Document DbId="4626971" Type="3">C-43, An Act to enact the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Labour Relations Modernization Act and to amend the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251083">Our party supports this legislation at second reading, because the bill is generally in line with our party's long-stated support for the right of RCMP officers to engage in collective bargaining, if that is their wish as democratically expressed by the membership.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251084">We, of course, support sending the bill to committee where we look forward to studying it in detail and proposing amendments to deal with a number of specific concerns that we have with the current drafting, to which we have every hope that goodwill on all sides of the House will help us effect positive changes.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251085">The background to the bill is quite straightforward. Bill <Document DbId="4626971" Type="3">C-43</Document> was introduced in response to a decision of the Ontario Superior Court, referred to as the MacDonnell decision. Justice MacDonnell ruled in April 2009 that the existing labour relations regime pursuant to the RCMP Act was a violation of the constitutional right of RCMP officers to engage in free collective bargaining, if that is in fact their choice.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251086">Although the government was initially hostile to RCMP unionization and engaged in repeated appeals of judicial findings against the existing system, it appears that the government has come to accept that some form of unionization within the RCMP is not only desirable, but is actually legally required.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251087">Bill <Document DbId="4626971" Type="3">C-43</Document> would provide a new labour relations regime for employees of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police who are engaged in policing. The proposed legislation is once again the government's response to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice decision I just referred to, and, again, that court held that to deny RCMP police employees the right to engage in collective bargaining, a right that forms part of the right to freedom of association in section 2(d) of the charter, was indeed unconstitutional.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251088">Once that court decision was made in April 2009, there was no longer any mechanism for establishing a collective bargaining framework for RCMP management to police employees. Recognizing that potential vacuum, the court suggested that Parliament consider establishing a legislation framework for collective bargaining. While the court emphasized that a statutory framework was not a precondition to the establishment of an effective process of collective bargaining, such a statutory framework would, in his words, greatly facilitate this outcome.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251089">In light of this recommendation the court suspended the declaration of invalidity of section 96 of the regulations, that is the part of the act that was struck down, for 18 months to allow the government an opportunity to introduce labour relations legislation for RCMP police employees, and I would like to offer my congratulations to the government for complying with that direction of the court.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251090">I want to start back in June 2008, just before the last federal election. At that time the RCMP had been engaged in a long discussion with the government about the long-standing recruitment and retention problems that it had experienced. Also, there are a number, and have been a number, of pressing issues facing the RCMP that I will go over in a few minutes that require not only resolution, but also the important input of the RCMP officers and civilian members to join into the discussion to find a resolution for those issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251091">The Conservative government negotiated increases in the summer of 2008 to address those very real recruitment and retention issues identified by the front-line RCMP officers, and in fact RCMP management, and they actually came up with percentage increases that would help to start the process of alleviating those issues.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251092">What happened? The election occurred and intervened in September and October. On October 16, after the election, we found that the Conservative government reneged on its promises. As soon as it was elected in October 2008, the government betrayed its promise on the very percentage increases that it had agreed to for the RCMP just before the election. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2251093">I was engaged in collective bargaining for 16 years. One of the cornerstones of labour relations in this country is the concept of good faith. It is the concept that, when parties come to a table and make an agreement, they keep that agreement. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251094">The Conservative government did not do that. It broke its promise. It broke its commitment. It broke its word. The government betrayed the officers who came, in the summer of 2008, and shook hands across the table on a modest percentage increase that the government did not see fit to honour. That is simply unacceptable misconduct, and that is one of the prime reasons why workers consider unionization. When the employer comes to the table and proves itself unworthy of good faith negotiations, the workers then pursue a regime where the other side is compelled to sit down at the table and bargain under a statutory framework because it cannot be trusted.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251095">The Conservative government that broke its promise to RCMP officers are the same people who, in the provincial election of 2009, also told the people of British Columbia that they would not bring in an HST. It is the same politicians. British Columbia Liberals are federal Conservatives. They also misled the voters of that province. They are getting into a habit of breaking their promises and telling voters one thing before an election, when they want their vote, and then acting in a different way after the votes are counted. I come from a riding where democracy is highly prized. The people of Vancouver Kingsway do not tolerate any longer politicians who say one thing before an election and act a different way after an election.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251096">The government fought the simple request by officers of the RCMP to have the right to choose or not to choose to collectively bargain. We must remember that RCMP officers have not chosen to join a union yet, and New Democrats are neutral in this regard. However, we will stand up for all workers in this country to have the right to make that choice for themselves and the right of those workers to make those decisions unmolested, unintimidated and of their own free will and accord, as they measure the pros and cons of collective bargaining. That is a choice purely of the workers. In this case, it is purely the choice of RCMP officers and civilian members across this country to determine if they want to collectively bargain or not.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251097">The Conservative government spent millions of taxpayers' dollars fighting that simple proposal. The courts found that the government's position was unconstitutional, that the longstanding prohibition in law that prohibited RCMP members from collective bargaining in this country was a violation of their charter rights. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251098">The Liberal government that went before the present government also participated in that violation of constitutional rights, so we will hear no great words of wisdom or principle from the Liberal Party about this issue either, since those members did nothing as the constitutional rights of RCMP officers of this country were violated, abrogated and abridged for decades.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251099">I might point out that the RCMP is the only police force in this country that has been prohibited from unionizing. It is high time we corrected this problem. I am proud that New Democrats are the only party that has stood up for the rights of RCMP members to unionize from the get-go.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251100">I also want to talk a bit about RCMP officer input. It has been my experience that successful economies bring to the table the ideas of the management and the entrepreneurs, the ideas and the energy of workers who carry out those directions, and also a government framework that provides a healthy environment for business and labour to flourish at the same time. What is really important about the unionization process in this case is that it can provide a vehicle for RCMP officers to bring to the table their important input into the workplace. That voice has been missing up until now.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251101">I want to congratulate a few people. RCMP officer Patrick Mehain has courageously and with absolute selfless commitment dedicated himself to the fight to allow his brothers and sisters in the RCMP to decide to unionize or not. He has done that at great personal cost to his career. He has demonstrated time and time again the bravery that one would expect from an RCMP officer, but bravery that goes above and beyond the call of duty.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251102">I also want to give great plaudits to the Canadian Police Association and particularly its president, Charles Momy. The Canadian Police Association has been steadfast in lending its support to its sisters and brothers in the RCMP in helping them achieve the very same thing that every other police officer in this country has, which is the right to collectively bargain.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="00">(1600)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2251103">I want to talk a bit about some concerns with this bill, because it is not perfect.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251104">First, it limits the choice of bargaining agent. Right in the bill, it says that the officers can choose any union they want, as long as it is a union that has an established collective bargaining relationship in the policing world. In theory, that is an unacceptable abridgement of a worker's right to choose the collective bargaining agent as they wish. However, I leave it to the RCMP officers to determine if they can find an appropriate bargaining agent. I think that actually they can.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251105">Second, the legislation prohibits certain topics from being discussed at the bargaining table. Once again, that is an unacceptable violation, in theory, of the rights of people to come to the table and to be able to put on the table whatever issues in the workplace they wish. In this case, the legislation prohibits the bargaining agent from talking about these issues: pensions, appointments, promotions, layoffs and classifications.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251106">One can understand pensions, because most public sector employees fall under an already established pension scheme, and I can see that. However, there is no principled reason, in law or in practice, why the bargaining agent or the workers should not be able to come to the table and talk about how their work is classified and give their input and suggestions about how that should work in practice. There is no principled reason to state why those workers should not be able to talk about a layoff process or a fair promotion process.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251107">These are aspects of collective agreements across this country that unions have been dealing with for decades and decades, so we are going to be looking forward to exploring at committee why the government thinks that the bargaining agent should not be allowed to discuss those cases and have input, just input, into how those important aspects of their work relationship operate in practice. We will be working to try to amend the bill in that regard.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251108">I also want to raise a concern of the civilian members of the RCMP who work very closely with the officers. These are people who provide very critical and important support to the RCMP officers in their day-to-day activities. They do scientific and forensic work. They run the full gamut of the policing work and work intimately with the RCMP officers in the field.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251109">This legislation gives the autocratic ability to the minister of the Treasury Board to determine which bargaining unit they may go into, and that as well is an unacceptable infringement of those people's rights to choose who their bargaining agent is and how they choose to bargain.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251110">There are pressing issues that I mentioned that are facing the RCMP, many issues that have challenged the force. I think I speak on behalf of all Canadians when we say that the RCMP has a long and proud tradition in this country. It has been known as one of the pre-eminent police forces in our country for a long time and it has a storied history, one that is full of its triumphs and also, it is fair to say, some of its tragedies. However, the issues that we face today with the RCMP, as parliamentarians, and that the RCMP force itself has to deal with, include the following.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251111">They have to deal with issues of RCMP oversight and developing a structure that can restore the confidence of the public so we know that, when there are complaints against RCMP officers, there is a fair, transparent and accountable process to deal with those complaints.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251112">We have the issue of the government closing single-member detachments all over this country, particularly in rural areas, and that is certainly not the way New Democrats would like to see this force going. We say we should be beefing up those single-member detachments, because the NDP thinks that a having a single member in a small town provides an unsafe, unacceptable working condition for that officer, but the answer is not to close that detachment and leave that community unpoliced.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251113">The New Democrats have heard from rural politicians who tell us that they may be an hour and a half or two hours away from the nearest policing resource. What happens when there is an emergency, when there is a domestic assault case going on or something more serious such as a murder or a sexual assault occurring? The government likes to talk about how tough on crime it is, but really, it is closing single-member detachments, which is going to leave hundreds of thousands of Canadians farther away from a police officer.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2251114">We have issues of member burnout, stress and post-traumatic stress disorder, very real issues facing RCMP officers in the line of duty, who are called upon to do a very difficult job on our behalf. They are often the very first person at the scene of an accident, sometimes with fatalities. They have to go to domestic situations where there is spousal assault and children involved. They are the people who have to investigate gruesome crimes of a sexual nature sometimes involving children. They are people who we put into the line of duty every day, into the line of assault and danger to their life and limb. Officers deal with that, and we need to support our officers in that regard. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251115">There are issues of officer morale and at present issues of leadership and management styles in the RCMP. There is the issue of taser use. Just the other day, we found out another person died in this country from the use of a taser, and we need to have a serious look at getting meaningful limitations on the use of that weapon because it clearly is not being used appropriately at the present time. We have issues of RCMP accountability, as I talked about, with civilian oversight. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251116">We also have service delivery issues. I recently met with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, which told me that the federal Conservative government has downloaded $500 million of policing responsibilities on to the municipal and rural areas of this country without a dime of compensation. There is a lack of responsiveness to local policing needs. They told me they cannot get the RCMP to do bylaw enforcement because it does not have the time or resources. Once again, the Conservative government likes to use crime as a political issue and likes to talk and say how tough it is, but it has not put the money behind its word. The Federation of Canadian Municipalities said this to me.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251117">I also want to talk briefly about what unions do and why this is important. Over the last 30 years, the middle and working classes in this country have been hit hard, primarily because of Conservative policies, the policies of the Mulroney government that were carried on by the Liberal Party in the 1990s. The neo-Liberal policies talked about cutting government spending and downloading expenses to the provinces, policies that saw a downloading of costs that resulted in public services being eroded over the last 25 years. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251118">Here are the statistics. Canada's richest 1%, 246,000 Canadians whose average income is $405,000, took almost one-third, 32% of all growth in incomes between 1987 and 2007. That is the period of Liberal and Conservative governments.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251119">Since the 1970s, the richest 1% in this country has seen its share of total income double. The richest 0.1% has seen its share triple. The richest 0.01% has seen its share increase by more than 500%. In 2009, 3.8% of Canadian households controlled $1.78 trillion of financial wealth or 67% of the total wealth in Canada. This is what has happened under Conservative and Liberal rule in this country. The rich have got richer and the middle class and working class have got poorer. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251120">That is why unionization, which has been proved to show that workers will gain more of their fair share of the economic pie in this country, is so important to the RCMP. It is why the New Democrats will continue to stand up for the rights of Canadian workers of all types, including the RCMP, to access collective bargaining if that is their wish, so that they can have a say in their workplace and in bargaining the terms and conditions of their work, including their compensation packages, which will help build better lives for them and their families.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I am sure he would agree, in light of what he said, that we should also support the RCMP veterans.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251122">He talked about the infringement of the rights of the civilian members who play a very important role in terms of technical support to the force and very often it is support at the front line. Sometimes it is a civilian member who is right there at the stakeout making sure the equipment is working, making sure the recording devices and the cameras and so forth are operating properly. That is an important role. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251123">What I have heard from the civilian members is that they want to maintain their own separate category. They do not want that category to be removed as is proposed by the legislation, and they feel this is a question of retention, in part, that if they are not maintained as a separate group, if they are put into the regular public service, some members will leave and go off to other departments, when it is very important to keep them there supporting the RCMP.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251124">I would like my hon. colleague's comments on that concern.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It could create difficulties in how these members work day to day with the RCMP officers. It could also cause people to leave their jobs and seek employment elsewhere if they feel that their working conditions are eroded and they cannot perform their services in the manner in which they have been accustomed to doing.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251127">I have also met with civilian members of the force and have heard first-hand their expressions of this concern. We should tread very carefully on that because policing requires a comprehensive, co-operative framework among everybody who works on the force, the civilian staff, the civilian members, and the members themselves.

We cannot have a free collective bargaining system if management, in this case the government, is actually directing or, in any way, truncating the rights of the employees to choose who they want to represent them.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251132"> The employees cannot compel management.

I think all Canadians, all RCMP officers and all trade unions should know that it is easy to talk the talk during elections and pretend to stand up for collective bargaining in this country, but when in government, to not actually do anything about it, tells a tale more loudly than words do.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251138">I also would like to mention that the expanded powers as proposed for the RCMP commissioner are problematic and worthy of concern.

It is almost like the government is trying to set the stage to take the choice away from RCMP members as to who represents them. What will the government do next? Will it pass a law that says that it will choose the lawyer in a case against it? It is ridiculous. We live in a country where we have the right to organize. The RCMP, if given the right to organize, should be given the choice of who represents its members.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251141">One concern I have after listening to the commentary today is whether an RCMP officer, in meeting with management, would have the right to have union representation of his or her choice present.

This legislation would prohibit the parties from talking about layoff, promotion, appointment and other things that are standard fare in collective agreements.

It is an opportunity to reflect on the incredible work that the men and women in the RCMP do. If there is anything this House can agree on, it is the work that front-line officers do in keeping our communities safe and putting their lives on the line.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251147">I had the opportunity, as the public safety and national security critic for the Liberal Party, to visit attachments across the country and talk with officers. I am always amazed by the work they do and the quality people we have been able to attract to the force.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251148">In that regard, I am pleased to stand and speak to the bill and the portions that are supportable. I will also talk about some areas of weakness that need to be examined in committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251149">First, it is important to look at the origins of where this bill came from. The hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128327" Type="2">Vancouver Kingsway</Affiliation>, who spoke earlier, talked about the fact that it has been a long time that the RCMP has not unionized. However, what the member left out is that it was not an issue until 2008. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251150">I remember in 2008 when the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made a commitment to RCMP officers that they would be given simple parity with other forces, that they would be paid the same for the same job essentially. This was brought forward because there was a real problem with retention and recruitment. The feeling was that they had to be paid the same as other forces that were out there. The Prime Minister gave his word in 2008, shook hands with those RCMP officers who were there and made a speech about how important it was to achieve parity.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251151">Mere months later, that promise was broken. The commitment was tossed out the door and the words soon forgotten. The RCMP were left shocked, bewildered and feeling betrayed. As a result, many felt that the time had come to ask for the right to unionize.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251152">Collective bargaining is a right enjoyed by every other police force in the country. One would assume that when the RCMP members asked for the opportunity to put this to a vote and allow them to decide that the government would have said, of course, as that was their democratic right. However, the government did no such thing. It stood in their way and the matter had to be taken to court.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251153">In April 2009, before the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, it found that section 96 of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police regulations breached the freedom of association in accordance with the RCMP under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom. It concluded that the 20,000-plus members of the RCMP did in fact have a right, as did every other police force, to make a decision on whether they wanted collective bargaining and who they wanted as their bargaining agent.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251154">It is not as if this was given freely by the government. The RCMP had to fight for it after the betrayal in 2008.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251155">However, it is not as if the government then pounced upon the finding of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. In fact, we had to wait from that point until June 17, 2010. It was more than a year later before the government then tabled this bill. This bill was tabled in June and yet we are only just now beginning the process of debating it at second reading.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251156">Committees are going on right now and, in fact, I am taking a brief break to speak here before I head back. However, in committee we will be talking about whether we should immediately go to clause by clause on a pardon bill. We have already dealt with half of the bill, which was Bill <Document DbId="4640457" Type="3">C-23A</Document>, and we will be dealing with Bill <Document DbId="4640276" Type="3">C-23B</Document>, but the government is attacking us for not passing this bill immediately. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251157">However, if we look at the state of that bill, it is already on the verge of going to clause by clause. The government itself has admitted that the bill is flawed and needs amendments, which we still have not seen, and yet the government is saying that we are holding it up. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251158">Here is a bill that is in front of us that essentially nothing has happened with since June. In fact, nothing really has happened since the court decision in April 2009 and yet government members feel free to stand and attack myself and other members, who are diligently trying to do work at committee, saying that we are not moving those bills fast enough. Obviously this has not been a high priority for the government and, as a result, this matter continues to stick and linger.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251159">I will talk about some of the things that the bill does initiate and some of the things that we support. I also will quickly go through some of the items that are weaknesses in the bill. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2251160">If implemented, Bill <Document DbId="4626971" Type="3">C-43</Document> would give RCMP members the right of choice whether they want to continue to work in an non-unionized environment or to pursue a unionized option where they would be represented by a certified bargaining agent. Under a unionized scenario, RCMP members would not be able to withdraw their services. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251161">It would further give the RCMP commissioner new powers to appoint, promote, discipline, demote or terminate the employment of all members, including commissioned officers. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251162">On that point, the committee will need to look in more detail at what exactly is the scope of these new powers and how they would be applied. That is an area of some concern. On the first point, just simply giving the choice to members to unionize or not is something that should be taken as a given and something that RCMP members should not have had to fight for over the last number of years.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251163">It would further establish a total compensation advisory committee to provide recommendations to the <Affiliation DbId="147110" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> with recommendations on overall compensation of RCMP members who are not represented by a certified bargaining agent. Under a unionized scenario, this would include RCMP officers, executives and other non-represented or excluded employees of the RCMP.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251164">Further, it would establish a consultation committee to address workplace issues. Through a series of local, divisional, regional and national consultative committees and working groups, members would be given the opportunity to bring their views and concerns directly to managers, either individually or as a group. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251165">It would maintain the existing informal conflict management system whereby options will continue to be offered to resolve conflicts above and beyond the formal grievance process, such as mediation through a third party. The use of these options would be voluntary, confidential and impartial. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251166">It would provide the commissioner the authority to implement a restructured discipline system that would seek to resolve conduct issues transparently, consistently and promptly. RCMP members would have the right to refer certain decisions or actions of management to the Public Service Labour Relations Board, an impartial and external decision-making body.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251167">And it would establish the Public Service Labour Relations Board as an independent, external third party to make final and binding decisions relating to discipline issues and some grievances of RCMP members.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251168">There are many items that have been called for over a long period of time, certainly that Liberals have been pushing for, that are commendable and laudable and can be supported. One of the areas that is concerning and will have to be looked at in committee is provisions in the bill that would limit who the bargaining agent might be. I am not sure what the reason is for those limitations and why they would be put into force, but it is certainly something that would have to be explained and at the moment seems contrary to the spirit of the decision that was made by the Ontario Superior Court. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251169">On the fact that it would limit certain matters to be discussed, I am concerned about limiting the ability to discuss classification of work, how layoffs might happen, and matters dealing with promotions. These are normally things that would be included in the collective bargaining process. It seems unusual that they would be cut out. It would certainly not be in the tradition of other collective bargaining processes enjoyed by other police forces. So that is going to have to be described and given some consideration.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251170">As for the provision for the Treasury Board president to be able to decide who the bargaining agent is for civilian members, there has been no good explanation provided for that and obviously has a number of civilian members scratching their heads and being concerned as to why the government would put that provision in and why that power would be granted to the Treasury Board president. That will need to be looked at in committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251171">Further, I am also concerned about the additional powers given to the commissioner. These powers need to be explained more fully. The powers are particularly concerning in the context of things that we have been hearing about within RCMP, about the head of the organization, about the structure at the top of the organization not being in shape relative to the rest of the organization. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251172">In that regard, because it really reflects on the overall issue of morale, recruitment and retention, we have to talk about some of the other things happening within the force. I am going to start with those that have a direct impact on this notion of extending additional powers to the RCMP commissioner.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251173">Let us start with the commission of inquiry conducted by Justice O'Connor. Justice O'Connor found that the oversight mechanisms provided to the RCMP were wholly inadequate. To give an example, the RCMP public complaints commissioner was not empowered to proactively initiate an investigation when something went wrong. He did not have the power to force information from individuals and it could only be provided to him voluntarily.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2251174">Also, as many of the operations conducted by the RCMP, particularly those dealing with intelligence and security operations, deal with more than one agency, there is no power to follow the bouncing ball. If something happens within the RCMP, there is no power to see what happened at immigration or what happened at the Canada Border Services Agency, so everything exists in a silo.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251175">The notion of giving the RCMP commissioner additional powers in the absence of having adequate oversight, I think, is deeply troubling. If Justice O'Connor's report was new, the government could be forgiven for not implementing it. However, we are coming up to nearly the five-year mark of Justice O'Connor's report being tabled. The government said it agreed with the conclusions of Justice O'Connor, agreed that those had to be implemented immediately, yet those recommendations still sit collecting dust, with no action taken.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251176">This is particularly concerning given the fact that we saw what happened with Mr. Arar and the terrible ordeal he went through in a Syrian prison. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251177">It was repeated with Mr. Almalki, Mr. Abou-Elmaati and Mr. Nureddin, in the report done by Justice Iacobucci where he repeated the call, the need for these reforms to take place and to have that oversight.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251178">For I and other members to sit in a room where we had a replica of the cell that these gentlemen were confined to, as they told their stories of listening and waiting as footsteps went by, wondering when they were going to be pulled from their cell and tortured next, and knowing that detention and torture had at its heart many failures within the Canadian intelligence system, we would think the government would be urgently trying to remedy that so that these horrific circumstances and the torture that these men went through would not be repeated. Yet here again we have a bill giving the commissioner new powers, with no oversight.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251179"> I would remind this House that Paul Kennedy, who was the RCMP public complaints commissioner, also talked about the urgent need of reform within his office. He spoke about the import of some of these changes and oversight. Of course, like anyone who criticized the government, he was fired, ostensibly his contract was not renewed, because of the fact that he was being critical, because he was showing what needed to change, what needed to be done. The government got rid of him, which is a terrible tragedy. This is somebody who did tremendous work.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251180">Who replaced Mr. Kennedy? Essentially, it was a wills and estate lawyer who had made all kinds of contributions to the Conservative Party, who we have never heard from since and I do not suspect we ever will.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251181">It is hard to think of a week that went by where we did not hear from Mr. Kennedy, stepping forward and speaking out on behalf of the changes that needed to happen within the RCMP. Yet, of the new commissioner, we hear essentially nothing, which given his background and connections to the Conservative Party is probably exactly what the government was hoping for.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251182">However, when these voices are killed, these independent voices that shine light into dark corners, that give us an opportunity to know what the truth is and what is going on, the whole process is undermined. Frankly, it is offensive that the government would come and ask to give even more powers to the commissioner in absence of moving forward at all with any of these oversight mechanisms.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251183">It is also important for us to reflect upon the work that was done in the Brown report, in the wake of the RCMP pension scam, where he said there had to be important structural changes happen to the RCMP as an organization. Mr. Brown gave the government two years. He thought it was an aggressive but achievable timeline in which to make those changes. The government did nothing. It did not recommend a single one of Mr. Brown's changes. Despite the fact that it said, yes, it agreed with what he said needed to be done, it did not implement those changes. In fact, some six months ago we celebrated the two-year mark he had given for the changes to be implemented.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251184">So it is not surprising, when we look at this, why we are having some problems within the RCMP in terms of morale. Those brave men and women who are on the front lines doing their job are looking and asking why these changes are not taking place; why is reform not happening at the top of the organization; why is the government consistently ignoring commission after commission, inquiry after inquiry?</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2251185">The public safety committee has issued many recommendations on this, and it too is ignored. The government's response is, “Yes, we are going to do it”, and then it does not.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251186">We also know that Mr. Kennedy spoke very clearly about the need to take action with respect to conducted energy weapons. The report that he did on the death of Mr. Dziekanski and the lessons that came from there still largely has not been implemented. Most of the recommendations, some of them very simple around providing direct guidelines and direction for use of conducted energy weapons, still sit not implemented.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251187">As an example, in the case of Mr. Dziekanski, who was fired upon multiple times, the second and third time even after he was already subdued and riling on the ground in pain, one simple recommendation would simply be that once somebody is incapacitated, to stop shooting them. It would seem a fairly straightforward thing to be able to implement, yet even that is not there.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251188">We also know with respect to conducted energy weapons that it really needs to be placed into that continuum of force training that happens at depot, yet at depot that does not happen. Right now when they are getting their continuum of force training, conducted energy weapons are not part of the training. They have guns, a stick, and pepper spray, but left out of that continuum is the taser and the question of where exactly in application of force it should be put.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251189">When we reflect upon all of this overwhelming desire for change, all of the self-evident changes that need to happen and the fact that the government continually does not do it, I am completely baffled as to why.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251190">I get asked by many members, if all of these things are so self-evident, if these reports have been done with clear and concise recommendations and timelines and it is made clear how the implementation should happen, why has it not been done?</ParaText><ParaText id="2251191">The latest excuse, when we get an excuse, was that they were waiting for Justice Major's report on Air India. After Justice Major tabled his report some seven or eight months ago, there was a lot of hope that we would finally get movement on all of these things that have been outstanding forever.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251192">Yet last week the government tabled its so-called action plan on Air India and absent from the action plan was any action. Instead of actually moving on all these things that have been standing and waiting to move forever, there were some vague, general aspirational statements that we would have expected the day after Justice Major's report came out. There is still no movement whatsoever on oversight.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251193">In the case of Justice Major's report, where there were a number of new things that were talked about, including somebody who could head up counterterrorism to break through those different silos there, the victims of Air India had to wait all that period of time only to be told that after the government had said six months ago that it would accept the recommendation, it is now tossing it out.

Instead of creating a mechanism that has built within it accountability, we throw a whole bunch of powers to one person and hope he or she uses them judiciously. That is a dangerous approach at the best of times, but in the absence of oversight, it is downright reckless.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251203">We know right now that there are serious questions within the RCMP about how things are working at the most senior level, about how criticism is being taken and how judiciously power is being used.

If we are to give police officers new powers, and we very much support that so they can go after terrorist networks, child predators or whomever it might be online and get at them as they move and operate technologically, we cannot move on those new powers unless we correspondingly have oversight. The two must move in tandem. Therefore, it is concerning in the bill, yet again, to see new powers bestowed with no new oversight.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

One of the issues for me, living in rural Canada, specifically rural Newfoundland and Labrador, and my colleague from the NDP touched on this as well, is the downloading of services to local areas. When it comes to single-member detachments, that is certainly a concern in my area.

We would not be dealing with the bill in the House today had it not been for an Ontario court decision last year. The government has fought this issue for quite some time.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251223"> We are talking about giving RCMP members the ability to form a union of their choice if they wish. This issue has been discussed for quite a number of years and governments, whether Liberal or Conservative, have made no effort to be helpful and allow this to happen. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251224">Members of the organization spent a considerable amount of money and time to take this issue to court. When they won the court decision, the government quickly introduced legislation, which appears to take away some of the rights the members wanted by going to court in the first place.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251225">RCMP members want to select their own bargaining agent. This legislation dictates that only a bargaining agent which primarily represents workers in the field of policing is eligible to be certified as a recognized union for RCMP officers. To the average person, this may make a lot of sense, but it is a fundamental restriction on the right of workers to choose who they want as their bargaining agent.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251226">The same issue comes into play with respect to civilian members. The RCMP has now grown to around 24,000 members. The minister indicated today that there were perhaps 3,000 to 4,000 civilian members in the RCMP. They too are being restricted in ways that they perhaps would not have contemplated when the decision to go to court was made. It is left in the hands of Treasury Board to decide their fate. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251227"> The Conservative government knew for several years that this issue was before a court. It knew there was a possibility that it might lose, and that is what happened. The government lost the decision and because of a court order, it introduced the legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251228">The government could have quickly consulted with members of the RCMP before it brought the legislation to the House. It could have asked civilian members for their opinion as opposed to simply introducing the legislation, saying it could not consult because it was operating on the basis of a court order, that consulting would happen once the bill went to committee. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="55">(1655)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2251229">The NDP has agreed to support this legislation to get it to committee. However, the civilian members who are contacting me will now have to go through the process of making arrangements and representations to the committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251230">We all know that the committee process is not like the process in the Manitoba legislature, which I am familiar with, where we let anybody make a presentation. Provided that the presenters know about the bill they are presenting on in the first place and when the committee is meeting, they can come and register at the last minute, show up by the hundreds if they want and they are given their 10 minutes to present and answer questions. That is how it is dealt with.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251231">However, in this case we are talking about a committee that is held here in Ottawa. How are these members supposed to travel in from outside the Ottawa area at their own expense to present before the committee? The way these committees operate in Ottawa is different from the provincial committees. The provincial committees allow anybody to come in, whether people are experts in the area or whether the come in off the street, and give their opinion. It is a totally different environment here.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251232">These members will not be invited to present to the committee unless they are recognized experts. Certainly that was my experience with the air passenger bill of rights and any other legislation in which I was involved. It is a very selective process in Ottawa.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251233">I am not in any way happy with how this is happening because the civilian members who are contacting me are absolutely right. They missed the consultation before the bill was drafted. We can tell them all we want that they will have a chance at committee but we know better than that. We know they will not be invited to the committee because the committee is very restricted. The committee will only sit for a few days and it will want to hear from expert witnesses.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251234">However, that does not mean that the issue will not be aired. The committee will hear from the experts and, hopefully, the civilian members who are contacting me will be happy. However, the civilian members should have been given more opportunity to make a presentation to the committee.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251235">I want to read an email correspondence from Ms. Deneene Curry from Edward Avenue in Transcona in my riding. She is one of the civilian members of the RCMP who will be affected by this legislation. She expresses concerns about the bill, perhaps concerns that could have been dealt with had she had proper consultation in advance of the bill being introduced.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251236">She talked about a section 20(1)(a) that would place the positions of civilian members under threat of conversion to public service positions, and that the Treasury Board, as we have indicated, would ultimately determine the category of an employee within the RCMP. She is concerned that at no point does it seem that the civilian members will be allowed to collectively vote on the issue or decide on their future status. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251237"> I thought this was all about giving freedom of choice to members to decide whether they want a union in the first place and, if they do decide to have one, to at least let them freely choose which union it is will be.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251238">However, that is not what is happening here. It appears that is being preordained. In the area of the civilian members, it appears that the Treasury Board would tell them and in the area of the officers themselves, the legislation would tell them who they can have representing them.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2251239">I ask the member for <Affiliation DbId="128487" Type="2">Hamilton East—Stoney Creek</Affiliation> to bear me out on this. In any other walk of life, in dealing with representation across the country, if workers in any other province decided to change representation or change unions they can vote and change representatives. However, that does not seem to be an option here. Members are being told that, in much the same way that they have had the company union association dealing with their concerns over the last several decades, now we would tell them who their representatives will be and, if they do not like them, l really do not know how many other options are out there.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251240">We know that the RCMP, which has 24,000 members, is the last police force without union representation and they are ready for it. I believe every police force in the country with over 50 members has union representation. The member for <Affiliation DbId="128487" Type="2">Hamilton East—Stoney Creek</Affiliation> might know that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251241">Ms. Curry goes on to say that the civilian members are considered subject matter experts in their fields and they are individuals with specialized training and skills sets that are unique to the RCMP and its environment. The civilian members are required to work various hours of the day, often on short notice, to meet investigational demands and court deadlines and they may be transferred or dispatched in the event of an emergency, disaster, special events, such as the Olympics and the G8, or to fulfill resource shortages. She says that this may no longer be the case if the civilian members are forced into the public service realm.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251242">She goes on to say that the civilian members are sworn in members of the RCMP and that they are therefore subject to the same sort of standards, expectations, regulations, security clearance and leave restrictions as regular members. Because of these factors, it is not an easy process to fill vacated civilian member positions with qualified individuals. They chose their civilian member positions over applying for other positions that they may have qualified for in other organizations. They are proud members of the RCMP and they devote their skill sets to the organization. If they are converted to public servants, there is a risk that many of these civilian members would seek employment opportunities outside of the RCMP, which would create a loss of valuable resources and put ongoing criminal investigations at a serious disadvantage.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251243">She is certainly concerned, and I think rightly so, but perhaps if the government had made an effort to consult with people like her before it introduced the bill, she and others would not be writing emails to me in this situation. I am sure I am not the only member of Parliament who is getting representation on this issue. We will certainly be in touch with her to let her know that the committee will be meeting and that she should phone the appropriate secretary of the committee as soon as possible to try to get on the list.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251244">I wanted to talk about the history of the RCMP and I found some very interesting historical facts. To make the argument that while it started small and has a very valuable role in our country, it has grown to 24,000 members. As with any organization, as it grows in size and develops there are different types of problems that are to be found in an organization of 24,000 people with the role and mandate of the RCMP.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251245">The RCMP has international involvement as well. It has been deployed on UN missions in Namibia, the former Yugoslavia, Haiti, South Africa, Rwanda, Bosnia, Sierra Leone, Guatemala, Western Sahara, the Netherlands, Croatia, Kosovo and East Timor, and the role of the RCMP on these UN missions was not to act as official peacekeepers but rather to act as a temporary civilian police force.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2251246">The RCMP has a huge role, and I could get into all the other roles that it has, but it is the police force where there is no local force. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251247">The organization has had a storied past and has been well respected over the decades in this country. However, in the last six years there have been numerous problems that point to an extreme level of difficulty within that organization. We heard about the stress on the job, the morale in the RCMP and the taser issues. At a certain point, the public started to ask questions. Maybe the first one or two problems within the force were simply greeted by the public as something that one should expect given the size and complexity of the organization, but there have been so many lately that I think the public have come to the conclusion that it is time to make some changes, and certainly this is a change.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251248">Perhaps the government does not see this as a positive change and dreads the idea of having a unionized police force. However, in today's environment, with a force of 24,000 people and the complexity and variety of problems they must deal with, having a union involved, the type of union environment that they choose on their own, might be very helpful in improving morale in the force and, I hope, would have something to do with reducing the stress levels in the force.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251249">The big problem right now within the force is that there does not seem to be any real avenue for people to express their opinion. Over the years that the company union was in place in the RCMP, there was much concern on the part of the officers to voice concerns in the workplace for fear they may not get a promotion, or they may not be seen as team players, or they may have some sort of retribution from their superiors. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251250">In forming their own union, one would hope that this would help to alleviate some of these problems. However, at the end of the day we are not 100% sure whether they would proceed with a union. There is a lot of scare-mongering going on out there.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251251">I am not sure of my time, but I know it is never enough.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251252"><B>Mr. Brian Jean:</B> It is for us.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251253"><B>Mr. Jim Maloway:</B> I thank the hon. member.

In this particular case, however, I have a couple of issues with how this is structured.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251259">It appears it would establish a consultation committee to address workplace issues. Through a series of local, divisional, regional and national consultative committees and working groups, members would be given the opportunity to bring their views and concerns directly to managers, either individually or as a group. That sounds all nice and everything else. However, the problem with that is that, from what I understand, it would then go directly to the commissioner as opposed to circumventing him and going directly to the Treasury Board.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251260">To me, it seems it is an exercise in employee morale as opposed to a specific issue that needs to be addressed by any particular individual.

One of the things that is important for us to understand as a group is that the right of workers to organize is a charter right.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251281">Here we have the government prescribing endless hoops for these workers to jump through, and police officers very surely are workers. If we look at the hours they put in and the duties they follow, they should have every right equal to any other citizen in this country. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251282">The reality for me is that, looking at the bill and now hearing the member for <Affiliation DbId="128453" Type="2">Elmwood—Transcona</Affiliation> talk about the committee, I am pleased to hear there will be some interventions at committee, because this bill has not been thoroughly thought out by the government.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The fact of the matter is that this has not been thoroughly thought out. This has been a rushed job, as a result of a court order, on the part of a very reluctant government, which did not like the decision of the court in the first place and I think is now trying to stage manage the final outcome of the process to make certain that the members do not get, as the member said, their charter rights, their right to pick their own union. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251284">Certainly there is the exposure with the civilian members, who obviously have not been thought about too much by the government.

Many individuals aspire to get into that profession, because it is a noteworthy, honourable profession to be in.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251288">I also like the fact that I am following the member for <Affiliation DbId="128453" Type="2">Elmwood—Transcona</Affiliation>, someone who I have known for a number of years, since 1988 I guess it would be. We sat on opposition benches for a good 11 years. I see he has not lost his touch. I look forward to having some exchanges with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128453" Type="2">Elmwood—Transcona</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251289">It is very important to recognize the need for labour relations and the important role that they play in the economy and our social fabric and how important it is that we move forward in trying to do what is right as legislators.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251290">I know in the past we tried to provide comment on what is good legislation and make the suggestion that it at least be allowed to move forward, although we want to stop some legislation in its tracks. My understanding and quick reading of this particular bill is that there is merit for it to go to committee. We look forward to seeing it go to committee. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251291">As has been pointed out, once the bill is in committee, opposing parties can work together to enhance the legislation and possibly make it better for our RCMP. That is a positive thing. I look forward to being able to see what type of amendments might arise from the committee stage.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251292">On this issue of RCMP and law and order, I listened to the question from one of the members opposite to the member for <Affiliation DbId="128453" Type="2">Elmwood—Transcona</Affiliation>. He talked about the government being tough on crime. When he said that, right away I kicked back into the byelection. In the byelection, that was a major issue. Crime and safety is something I hope to be able to talk about a lot as the days go on here in Ottawa and we are in session.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251293">The RCMP has played a critical role, not only while on duty but also when off-duty, I will suggest. I would like to give an example of the type of dedication our RCMP officers bring to the table.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251294">We see them in uniform. We see them in terms of what they do, particularly in Manitoba, in our rural communities, but also in our urban centres. Maybe what we do not see as much are the things the RCMP officers do during their off-duty hours. I have had the privilege of working with RCMP officers in their off-duty hours. I have had many opportunities to have discussions in terms of the types of contributions they make.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251295">Ultimately I would argue that this is one of the reasons why it is when we debate legislation of this nature that we do need to give it time and to allow for it to go to committee. My understanding is, and I am not 100% up on all the rules of this chamber obviously, that it will go to committee where we will hear presentations and hopefully see some amendments brought forward.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251296">Why I believe it is important, in good part, is that we need to return what we can to those officers who serve and serve us so well. One of the things I want to highlight is the off-duty responsibilities that many members, if not all, take.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251297">I have had the opportunity to be involved with a youth justice committee. These youth justice committees have proven to be fairly successful if they are managed well. Provinces will in fact take advantage of them and incorporate them into the system.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251298">On our committee we had a wonderful RCMP officer who has just recently retired. In the sense of commitment to volunteerism, this officer was fairly impressive.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2251299">I would encourage individuals as they start to think about how they want to see this bill develop going into committee to reflect on some of the volunteer efforts that our RCMP officers put in. I offer this as one example of the type of volunteerism that they provide.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251300">In this particular case it was Al Pasquini, a retired individual who made himself available first in the community of Thompson, I believe, in northern Manitoba. He dealt with young offenders and tried to come up with alternative ways in which dispositions could be held for where they had committed a crime. He really put a face on the whole process of justice. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251301">After years of serving with the RCMP in northern Manitoba he was relocated to the city of Winnipeg. Once he arrived in Winnipeg it was only a matter of weeks before he made contact with me and a couple of others and indicated that he wanted to continue doing volunteer work with young offenders. We were most happy to have him primarily because he was not only a great volunteer but he brought his expertise to the committee. He knew how to deal with young offenders first-hand and he understood why some of the crimes took place. He had the ability to communicate and follow through on the issues that were important in terms of dispositions for justice committees. He had so much to offer.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251302">All RCMP officers have phenomenal skill sets that are underestimated in terms of their importance and the role that they play. That is the reason why I would suggest that when we look at this legislation it is defined in the sense of when an RCMP officer is on duty, but that is only a part of it. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251303">For many RCMP officers volunteering is a way of life. I see Al Pasquini as one of those individuals who has dedicated his life to being an RCMP officer. To say that he worked 60 hours a week would probably underestimate the actual number of hours that Mr. Pasquini worked. Knowing other individuals within the RCMP I would say that Mr. Pasquini was not alone. This is the type of dedication RCMP officers bring to the table and at the end of the day this dedication is of great value to all of us. I was the chair of one of the committees on which Mr. Pasquini sat. We benefited because of his expertise and his willingness to volunteer. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251304">There is also the issue of what RCMP officers do during the work week, during their shifts. They put themselves in potential danger seven days a week, 24 hours a day, in order to ensure that we can feel safe in the environments in which we live. I suspect that the House would unanimously agree with me about the dedication shown by our RCMP officers with respect to the type of work they do and the benefits our communities receive as a result. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251305">I have had the opportunity to quickly go through Bill <Document DbId="4626971" Type="3">C-43</Document> and I feel it is a bill of great value. We should be looking for ways to improve labour relations between RCMP staff and management. I understand that the government did not volunteer to bring in this legislation. It was forced to bring in this legislation because of a court ruling and somewhat grudgingly brought this bill forward. For whatever reasons the bill is before us today. I do believe that the government has the responsibility to approach it with an open mind once it gets to committee. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2251306">I know from the Manitoba legislature that we often got presentations dealing with legislation that we had brought through, and I anticipate that there will be presentations that will be coming to committee for this bill. I look forward to hearing those presentations, or at least participating in that process, because it is an interesting profession. I have always admired the red coats and the roles that they have played. I made reference at the beginning of my comments to what an important symbol the RCMP is for Canadian society.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251307"> I have not had, I admit, the discussions with the RCMP officers or the rank and file as to what they feel about the legislation. I have a feeling that we will have some time, maybe not very much time, to be able to do that, and I look forward to having that dialogue. Knowing that this bill could in fact be passing at any point in time, I thought it would be nice just to be able to get up and comment on that today, but also to take the opportunity to emphasize something that has come out of the federal byelection, and that is the whole issue of crime and safety.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251308">Crime and safety was in fact the number one issue in Winnipeg North, and I would suggest it even goes beyond Winnipeg North. Our RCMP do play a critical role in that and we need to look at ways in which we can improve and support our forces, whether it is the RCMP or the local police forces, because it does make a difference. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251309">I suspect that establishing a new labour relations regime would go a long way in terms of just being able to ensure that there is a higher morale among the rank and file officers. That is something in which all sides can win. We do not have to be fearful of unions and organized labour. Organized labour does play a very important role in our society and I suspect that affording the opportunity for the RCMP to make that determination among themselves is something that they will take very seriously, and at the end of the day, I suspect that if we provide them the opportunity it will only be a question of time before it is acted upon.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251310">There needs to be some consideration given in terms of the whole issue of strikes and what would happen in strike situations. There are all sorts of issues related to arbitration. Labour relations can get complicated at the best of times in terms of trying to come up with the compromises and consensus that are necessary. Ultimately, the rank and file might feel better knowing that they have a labour group that has that vested interest to protect the rank and file's interests. That is why, as we are looking at Bill <Document DbId="4626971" Type="3">C-43</Document> today, I do not see any reason why the bill should not be going to the committee. By allowing it to go to committee, hopefully we will be able to hear from other members as to what they feel might be amendments that would enhance the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251311">I have had some experience in minority governments from 1988 to 1990, and what I have found is that minority governments can work if in fact the government is willing to look at good ideas and is prepared to compromise.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="30">(1730)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2251312">So I would look to the government benches and appeal to the government to look at ideas that might come from whatever political entity within this chamber and, ultimately, adopt good ideas.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251313">I suspect, I hope and I trust that at the end of the day ideas that might come from the official opposition would in fact be considered and we would be able to garner the support in order to see it passed.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251314">Obviously, if we all believe in the value of our RCMP, I do not understand why it is that we would be reluctant about trying to make this legislation even that much better, that much stronger, because the better we make the legislation, the more effective it would be. And at the end of the day, how would we lose if we have more value in legislation such as this so that our RCMP are feeling that much better and confident in terms of the House of Commons providing the type of support that they need?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251315">I believe, in good part, many members of the RCMP rank and file want to see legislation of this nature. I suspect it has been a long time in coming. Now that we have it here today, it is only a question of how it is that we might possibly modify it. However, at the very least, I see no harm in having the bill go to committee so that we can ultimately see what could be done to maybe even make it even a bit better legislation so that, at the end of the day, the biggest winners here would be our citizens, followed by the RCMP rank and file. This is something that I believe is important to all of us, that we want to have as much harmony as possible within the police ranks. We know that at times the current government's record, in terms of providing harmony, has been lacking as it has, in essence, created controversy. However, I will leave that possibly for another time.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251316">I am thankful for the opportunity to say a few words on the bill. I do look forward to being able to provide comments on other justice-related legislation as we get closer to the issue of the tough on crime type of bills. Members will find that I am very opinionated because at the end of the day what I have seen is a lot of talk about tough on crime, but I can say that in the last five years it has not gotten any better, in terms of crime and safety in many areas of Canada, in particular, in <Affiliation DbId="164895" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation>. I think people want to see action as opposed to words. It is more than just legislation. It is about engaging people. It is about looking at the laws that we currently have. It is about providing programming. There is so much that can be done on that particular front, but I will save that speech for another time.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

As he has indicated, I have known him now for a while. I was elected in 1986 and he was right behind, in 1988. He certainly fulfilled a very difficult role over the years in the Manitoba legislature, at one time or another, being the only member in the entire House from his party or maybe one of two. He certainly knows how to survive in a jungle, and this is just a bigger jungle than the one he has just come from. However, I do wish him well here.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251318">I want to ask him about the civilian members. I have had representations from various civilian members of the RCMP about this bill, indicating that they have not been consulted, that it is not well thought out, and that the whole process is not very helpful to them. I would assume that the member has been getting the same sort of representations from his office. So I would just like to ask him to expand on that aspect, or any other aspect that he wants to, regarding this bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251319">However, my main purpose was to congratulate him on his first speech in the House and I really wanted to be the first person to ask him a question.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We in opposition like to think they do their homework, that they do the consultation. Much like when I addressed the issue in my comments on the bill, I indicated that I did not really get the chance to talk to some RCMP officers in regard to it, and it is only because of timing, but I will talk to them.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251321">Most important, I believe we all have a role, but especially the minister who brings in the legislation.

Why I say that is if we ask a police officer or a RCMP officer what do they need today, they will tell us there is a need for additional policing. The government made a commitment for additional policing. I do not know the exact number. I think it was 2,000 or so officers or somewhere around there. The commitment was made to increase the hard resources of just personnel. That has never materialized.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251334">I do not believe the government has done what it could have done to improve morale, such as in legislation such as this.

The RCMP rank and file need to be given voice, not be forced to take direction from the government in the way members may or may not want to be represented.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251337">One of the faults of one of the options in the bill is giving the commissioner of the RCMP more power and that staff relations representatives would have to report to the commissioner. I can see nothing but problems with that kind of proposal.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251338">There were three concerns that led the Ontario superior court to find that the RCMP staff relations representative system was invalid. First, RCMP members had not had the opportunity to decide whether the SRRP was the system in which they wished to associate for labour relations purposes. In other words, they did not make a decision on that through a voting process. Second, the staff relations representative system was not sufficiently independent from RCMP management. Third, while RCMP management listened carefully to the views of staff relations representatives, it retained the ultimate decision-making authority in the SRRP consultative process. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251339">Those are the three concerns that led to the Ontario superior court finding that the RCMP staff relations representative system was invalid. I wanted to lay those facts on the table.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251340">After the superior court's decision, staff relationship representatives decided to comprehensively assess the labour relations needs of RCMP members and their satisfaction with the current SRRP through a quantitative study. Pollara Inc., an independent polling firm, was engaged for that assessment and 6,147 members took part in the survey. The survey has produced reliable and accurate information that can now be used to improve the SRRP to better serve the 22,000 RCMP members and address the superior court's concerns.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251341">It also found that 65% of RCMP members who expressed an opinion were satisfied with the system and 71% of RCMP members preferred to associate in either the current SRRP or a modified version of it. I believe every member of Parliament received a copy of that Pollara report.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251342">It is clear that the wishes of the very strong majority of the 22,000 of RCMP members were not reflected in this bill in total.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251343"> Let me be clear. Contrary to the ruling of the Ontario superior court, Bill <Document DbId="4626971" Type="3">C-43</Document> would offer no real choice to RCMP members for how they wanted to be represented, either in a union or non-union model of representation. It is either a union or a body established by the RCMP commissioner. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251344">Maybe there are some other alternatives that need to be considered, especially after the staff relations representatives went to their members and looked at potentially different ways of doing it. In committee that discussion can be held and if there are alternatives or other views brought forward that relate more to what the rank and file prefer, then that is the value of the bill being before committee. I hope the committee is open-minded enough to look at all the alternatives at play.</ParaText>

Some of the representatives from my province have made that very clear to me, especially those from the civilian sector of the RCMP.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251346">As a result of this legislation, the RCMP could be treated like any other public sector union. That is one of the possibilities. That means labour groups, like PSAC, would use it as a benchmark in contract negotiations.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251347">Finally, Bill <Document DbId="4626971" Type="3">C-43</Document> also endangers, according to some within the RCMP, hard-fought benefits currently held by RCMP members.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251348">There are some very strong concerns being expressed by current staff relations representatives. They are finding that the bill as currently proposed is unacceptable to a fairly strong majority of the RCMP members across the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251349">The staff relations representatives informed me that they believe the RCMP is at a crossroads and faces a number of difficult challenges, especially with respect to leadership and representation. Canada's police force does not need further uncertainty and more distractions.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251350">Members of the RCMP would certainly prefer to be focusing their energy on improving public safety rather than worrying about whether the federal government will impose a union on them.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251351">I would also say to those RCMP members that it is critical they involve themselves in this hearing process and make their views known, because if this new system is going to work with an important police force and everything its members do nationally and internationally, and the fact that they are seen as such a model for the country, they need to involve themselves in these discussions and make their voices heard. At the end of the day, whether it is this specific legislation or improved legislation, the rank and file, certainly the majority, have to be in accommodation with this legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251352">From their perspective, Bill <Document DbId="4626971" Type="3">C-43</Document> would create some significant problems. It is a top priority for the staff relations representatives and the membership of the RCMP. The members of the RCMP have been represented by the staff relations representatives for the past 36 years on all issues affecting members' welfare and their dignity as a force.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251353">The current staff relations representative program is non-union representation, but in the main it has worked reasonably well.

I would like the member's view on whether a civilian commissioner should be given additional powers over the rank and file of the RCMP as well as senior management. It scares the living daylights out of me that this particular commissioner could have additional powers.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251367">Second, in 2008, the member well knows that the pay council of the RCMP negotiated a 3.5% increase in salaries for 2009 and on. Unfortunately, I believe on December 21 or 23, in an email from Treasury Board to all RCMP members in the country, that pay increase was rescinded and the increase was changed to 1.5% with no consultation whatsoever. If we wonder why RCMP members want to unionize, it is to stop this nonsense happening with a dictatorial process of the government of the time. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251368">Instead of being proactive, the government has reacted to a court decision. We firmly believe that the RCMP should be allowed to join the association or union of their choice if that is what they so desire. Other aspects of the RCMP and the civilian members can decide on their own if they wish to unionize or have an association. This would be the true democratic process. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251369">I would like the member's comments on whether the RCMP should be allowed to determine for themselves who should represent their issues when it comes to negotiating pay and benefits with the Government of Canada.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I believe it is the rank and file that should make the decision.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251371"> I want to make it very clear, and I targeted my remarks at the current staff relations representative system, that option is not in there. If members of the RCMP decide they want to go to a union, then that is their choice. If they want to go to somewhat of a take on the current system and maybe report to Treasury Board and not the commissioner, that should be their choice too, but the current bill only allows two choices, either unionize or report to the commissioner of the RCMP. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251372">The hon. member asked should the commissioner have more power than he currently has. In my view, absolutely not. That is my personal point of view. It would be giving the commissioner too much power. If an individual has a problem within the system, somebody who is a staff relations representative has to report to the commissioner, but the commissioner is the person's boss. It makes no sense at all. No, there should be no power to the commissioner of the RCMP. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251373">From my point of view, the Government of Canada made a terrible mistake in not appointing a commissioner from the rank and file.

The member had the courage, did the research and did the drafting to put that into legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251379">The government took parts of that. For whatever reason it did not take the whole package, and some critical areas were missing. That is, as the member said, the kind of off ramp where it would not be a management-run union.

One of the concerns that I expressed in my remarks had to do with how it could divide people within the force who feel they are all part of the same system. They could basically defy or separate in terms of their representation, from special constables to civilian members to regular members. These people all work together in one way or another. It is a total system.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251386">Yes, there are some people on the highways and some people in criminal investigation but those people have to be connected throughout the system to do their job appropriately.

In fact, if it were not for the courts, it would not have done this at all. It is unfortunate when a group of Canadian heroes, the RCMP and their associates, need to take an issue of association and unionization to the courts to get a fair hearing.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251390">We know that the RCMP members, or gendarmes in Quebec, have asked for many years for the right to form a union or an association of their choice to deal with their pay and benefits when it comes to their management or with the government of the day.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251391">Let us just go into a little history of the RCMP. It is probably one of Canada's most recognized institutions and, unlike my Liberal colleague from <Affiliation DbId="164895" Type="2">Winnipeg</Affiliation> who spoke earlier, it is not a red coat. It is a red serge. Redcoats, of course, are British, and the Americans know all too well what the redcoats mean. However, it is the red serge in Canada and it is an honoured tradition for the men and women of the RCMP to wear the red serge. I have lived in British Columbia, Yukon and now Nova Scotia and I have had the chance to travel through Canada and I have yet to meet an officer who is not proud to wear the stetson and the red serge.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251392">Their families are also part of the uniform. As members know, just like our military, they also have to deal with a tremendous amount of stress when a member of their family, either a man or a woman, goes out and does his or her job for Canada on the domestic side, as well as the many RCMP officers who are serving overseas. Many of them are in Afghanistan right now training the Afghan police force on how to run a functional police service in that country. They are also in Haiti and other countries around the world. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251393">The reality is that it is a fundamental right for workers, in this case police officers, to form a union or an association of their choice. It is not the government's right to dictate what that union or association should be. For this bill to put handcuffs on what the RCMP may do in the future is really unfortunate and, to be quite honest, scandalous. To give a civilian commissioner any more powers than he or she already has will not go anywhere.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251394"> It was a sad day in this country when the Conservatives picked Mr. Elliott to be the Commissioner of the RCMP. Can members imagine for one second if they were to appoint a civilian as the CDS of the military? There would be an uproar in this country over that. What the Conservatives have said to those rank and file RCMP officers is, “If your goal is to one day be the top dog in the RCMP, forget about it, because we will appoint our friends, whomever we wish to get in there”.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251395">For years we heard from Liberals and Conservatives, when it came to RCMP investigations, that the RCMP was an independent body and that it will investigate on its own what it wishes to do. However, the minute Mr. Elliott was appointed as Commissioner of the RCMP, the tentacles of the PCO and the PMO were right into the RCMP. With the recent resignation and denial of many of the senior officers of the RCMP, there is no question that the hands of the <Affiliation DbId="128440" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the hands of the PCO are all over that, which is most unfortunate.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251396">I attended a Depot ceremony in Regina recently at its national mourning and there had to be at least 1,000 people there. The tension could be cut with a knife between the assistant commissioners of the RCMP and Mr. Elliott. It was a beautiful day and we were all there on a beautiful sunny morning but we could feel the ice out there and that should not have to be.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251397">The members of the RCMP should have tremendous respect for their commissioner and they would have that respect if that commissioner were one of their own. I would hope that the next commissioner comes from the rank and file of the RCMP, exactly the way it should be.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251398">On this legislation, it is again up to the individual RCMP members and its membership to determine what is best for them. If they wish to have an association, if they wish to have a union or whatever it is they wish to do, that should be up to them, independent of government, independent of politics and independent of the commissioner. The commissioner should have absolutely nothing to say about this. It should be free and independent. I am hoping those changes at the committee stage will happen. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp>
							<ParaText id="2251399">When it comes to the civilian members, the bill is so poorly drafted that the civilian members of the RCMP feel they are trapped. They do not understand why they may be dragged into something that they do not wish to have.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251400">If the government had consulted with these members, which it did not, it would understand quite clearly that the civilian members of the RCMP, independent of the men and women who serve as RCMP members, should have the right, if they wish, to form an association or a union of their type or keep the status quo. That is up to them to determine. It is not up to the commissioner, it is not up to us as politicians and it is especially not up to the government to determine that for them.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251401">Unfortunately, because I know the government's heart is not in this, which is why it is such a poorly drafted bill, a reactionary to a court decision, I suspect quite strongly that the government will drag it out through committee, drag it out through the summer and, if it comes back for third reading, it will send back to that other place where those Conservative sycophants we call senators will probably delay it until the next election, and, if we have an election, it will die. I suspect that is the Conservatives' goal at the end of the day. We have seen what these senators have done to good legislation before. When we have a government that says that it would never ever appoint Conservative senators, that it would never ever appoint its friends to the other place and it ends up appointing over 35 of them, we can understand where this is going to go.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251402">Unfortunately, a lot of this debate and discussion will probably be all for naught because we will probably have an election within the year and this bill will probably die an unfortunate natural death.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251403">What does this say to the morale of the men and women who serve our valoured RCMP? What we are basically saying is that the government has recognized that there is a court decision and that the government has brought forward legislation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251404"> However, if the government really wanted to, it could work with the opposition to come up with something that works, is fair, is balanced and is truly representative of what the members of the RCMP wish to have. Then we could get this through committee fairly quickly, on to the Senate and, hopefully, although I do not think it will happen, get this through the Senate so we can say to the men and women of the RCMP, the civilian members and others that we truly respect what they wish to do, which is to have fair and collective bargaining with the management of the RCMP and the government of the day.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251405"> I remember 2008 all too well when the current government negotiated for months with the pay council of the RCMP, an independent body to negotiate pay and benefits for the RCMP. It agreed, after months of talking, to 3.5%. What happened just before Christmas 2008? An email was sent by the Treasury Board rolling back and rescinding the 3.5% to 1.5%, no ifs, ands or buts, that was it.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251406">There is absolutely no aspect of discussion for the members in the pay council to go back to the Treasury Board and say “Whoa. We negotiated this is in fairness and in good faith and you turned around and arbitrarily destroyed it”. That is what the current government did. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251407">One minute it talks about law and order and says that it is the party of crime fighters and everything, and yet the men and women who, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, maintain that law and order are treated with complete disregard and disdain by that government over there. It is really unfortunate. It is no wonder that morale is down?</ParaText><ParaText id="2251408">Another aspect is that RCMP members have been asking for years for a veterans' independent program, very similar to that which veterans get. Right now, as we know, World War II veterans or Korean War veterans with a disability, or a spouse of a veteran with have a disability, can apply for a veterans' independence program that allows them to stay in their house even longer. The government would provide services for groundskeeping and housekeeping services. For those who receive the service, it is a tremendous benefit for them. RCMP members have been asking for years for the exact same benefit and for years they have been denied over and over again. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="20">(1820)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2251409">When we talk about heroes in the military and the armed forces, we should talk about RCMP members in the exact same breath. Many of them have served overseas, and many of them do the same type of work within Canada's borders.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251410">Imagine what goes through the mind of an RCMP officer when he or she has to extract three children from a car accident on Highway 401 at 3 o'clock on a Sunday morning. Years later when these officers are looking for help, we should be able to provide them the assistance they need. One of the ways we could help them would be through the veterans independence program, to ensure they are treated with respect and dignity when they get older and retire. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251411">We will support sending this bill to committee and hopefully we will be able to convince the government and the other opposition parties that the RCMP members themselves should be able to dictate exactly who will represent them and who will not. The days of the government telling the RCMP members in any way, shape or form what they should be doing or what they cannot do have to end, because that simply is not right. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251412">I have heard from members of the Liberal Party, the Bloc Québécois and Conservative members why they think this bill should go to committee.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251413">We are hopeful that rank and file RCMP members right across the country will have the opportunity, through either the Internet or personal visits, to talk to members of Parliament and tell us why they think this legislation needs to be changed, why it needs to be more representative of the men and women of the RCMP. I hope the committee will travel across the country to big and small cities, to wherever the RCMP is located. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251414">While I am on my feet, I want to personally congratulate several members of the RCMP who have done yeomen's work for the RCMP over the years.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251415">Mr. Jim Hill of Fletchers Lake, Nova Scotia, has given 30 years of service to the RCMP but unfortunately had to be medically released. This individual did tremendous work for his country and for the red serge throughout his career.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251416">Another individual I would like to thank is Mr. Murray Brown. After 37 years, Mr. Brown will be retiring from the RCMP at the end of this year. He is now in staff relations with the RCMP and has done a tremendous job of educating members of Parliament and senators, literally anyone who will listen to him, about the value of the RCMP and the problems that members and their families go through, everything from insurance programs to pension clawbacks, to VIP, to PTSD, everything. Mr. Brown has been absolutely fantastic in what he has been able to do. In fact, he was instrumental in getting to most members of Parliament and senators the magazine that my colleague from Malpeque talked about.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251417">Another big thanks to Mr. Abe Townsend, formerly of Nova Scotia and now living in Ontario. He works very hard in staff relations for the RCMP.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251418">It is very important that members of the RCMP have an unbiased and unprejudiced opportunity to present their concerns and issues directly to senior management without fear of retribution. We have already heard about what happens to senior management in the RCMP when they raise their concerns about a particular commissioner. Their head gets cut off and they are removed or retire suspiciously early. That has to stop.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251419">I firmly believe, and I am sure that every member of Parliament in this House believes, that the RCMP is one of the most trusted and valued institutions in Canada. It has had some bumps along the way, but the reality is that the RCMP is one of the institutions that makes this country great. I for one, and I am sure others, am very proud to know that there are many members in every community across the country who are doing a fantastic job for all of us.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251420">At the end of the day, all members of Parliament have to respect the men and women of the RCMP and allow them, either through legislation or whatever, the opportunity to determine for themselves what is best when it comes to either forming a union or an association or whatever it is they would like to do. If we get to that point and truly respect the men and women of the RCMP, that will be a great day in Canada . </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

A number of hon. members will have the opportunity to discuss the future of Haiti in a non-partisan manner. I would also like to say that I will be sharing my time with my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128503" Type="2">Winnipeg South Centre</Affiliation>, who will speak about the situation of women in Haiti in particular.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251438">This is an extremely important and non-partisan issue. In view of the meeting this morning between the <Affiliation DbId="128697" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> and Mexico's Secretary of Foreign Affairs, this debate will allow us to shed some light on this issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251439">Why must this debate be held today? I would like to quote Dany Laferrière, who said, “You are really dead when there is no one left on this earth who remembers your name.” We must not forget the Haitians. We must examine the situation. We must encourage and support them. The purpose of this debate is to send a message to our friends in Haiti to let them know that Canada is a player, that Canada wants to help them and that Canada will support them. But are we doing enough? Tonight's debate will help us to gain a better understanding of what is happening. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251440">We must bear in mind that because of the earthquake on January 12, 2010, which killed over 250,000 people, there are more than 1.5 million homeless people in the country. The cholera epidemic has affected hundreds of thousands of people and, sadly, has already caused 2,200 deaths. According to UN medical experts, that number could double.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251441">We need transparency and we need to know where the money is going. We must ask ourselves what is causing the current impasse. We have to remember that an election took place recently. The first round was on November 28, 2010. On December 7, the provisional electoral council announced the results. This sent shock waves through the country, because the people strongly suspected electoral fraud. People feel they have been tricked, and that the vote in no way reflects the current situation or the election results. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251442">Today I would like to talk about several things, including possible solutions. I think this can be a positive, constructive debate. We will talk about the election and we must consider various scenarios. We would also like to discuss the possibility of having a special envoy specifically for Haiti, as we do for other countries. Of course we will talk about the cholera outbreak and what we can do to stop it. It seems that NGOs are experiencing some difficulties. Is there enough humanitarian aid? Is it being used wisely? We need to examine the possibility of sending a special force, the disaster assistance response team or DART—although, as we know, the Haitian government must request it—which could play a leading role in this health and humanitarian crisis.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251443">I am extremely concerned. My interest in Haiti dates back over 25 years, and I have visited the country many times. My duties in a previous government allowed me to experience the Haitian reality first hand. Haiti has been through considerable turmoil and still today, they seem to be caught in a never-ending nightmare.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251444">The Canadian government, no matter the political persuasion, has always invested in Haiti through CIDA. Haiti has always received the most aid or has been one of the highest priorities for Canada. Unfortunately, in light of recent events, we believe that a storm is brewing. If we do nothing, if we do not take preventive action, chaos will most definitely ensue. We must not act out of fear. However, senators in that country—they were subsequently set straight, thank goodness—said that if it would take a civil war, then so be it. That is totally unacceptable.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251445">I salute the work of the international community, which called for order. However, many things need to be taken into consideration. With regard to the elections, there are three scenarios. The first would be to allow the process to proceed and have a recount. The <Affiliation DbId="128697" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> talked about this today.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="30">(1830)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2251446">All ambassadors accredited to Haiti signed a press release indicating that the process must be given a chance and that there should be a recount, and that the possibilities should then be examined. That was reiterated today.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251447">Unfortunately, when we listen to the candidates leading the presidential race, we realize that it may not necessarily happen. Mirlande Manigat was the first to refuse to participate in the recount. Michel Martelli has also refused to participate. The other 12 presidential candidates, despite their poor results, unanimously declared that they would not accept a recount.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251448">In my opinion, the role of the international community is to provide assistance. We are not there to dictate anything. We are there to provide guidance. We must provide technical assistance, and we must also encourage people and empower them. What is problematic is that the trust of the people and the candidates in the current government is dwindling. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251449">We have to consider an interesting alternative. Since the first round of elections was held on November 28 and the runoff elections are to be held on January 16, the episcopal group and civil society are suggesting that the runoff election on January 16 become the first round with a simple majority.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251450">There is a word in Creole that sounds exactly like a word in French and that is the word “magouille”. The word “magouille” means exactly the same thing in French and in Creole: a shady deal. People do not trust the system because they wonder how a ballot box can be recounted when that box was stuffed in the first place. An alternative should be considered such that candidates will all run again, the difference being that the first past the post will be elected president. The same would apply to the legislative elections.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251451">There is another option and that is to cancel the vote. To me, there is a problem with cancelling a vote and starting over. In 2004 there was a provisional government, a government of technocrats. Things started off well, but certain problems needed to be taken into consideration and I do not think it is adequate.</ParaText>

Our role is not to dictate a result. We are not there to pick a candidate and say this is our champion. This is not the case. Our role is to make sure we will respect the process. It is about democracy. We want to help the people cast their votes and make sure that the way it goes, the way the votes are calculated, will be accurate. This is the trust link that we have to build among the Haitian people.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251453">Frankly, if the people who are supposed to accept the recount process are not willing to do so, I think we should go for another option.</ParaText>

In Creole they say, “<I>Yon chen gen kat Patti Men, li p'ap ka pran yon sèl chemen.</I>” That means that a dog might have four legs, but it can only go down one path.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251456">That is probably what we should do as politicians.

There is violence in the streets, humanitarian work is virtually at a standstill and, as we have heard today, the electoral crisis is creating warnings that future humanitarian aid is at risk.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251478">It is imperative that the people of Haiti assume responsibility but equally important is for governments like Canada to work to resolve the democratic impasse as soon as possible.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251479">To my mind, the key issues, and my colleague identified them, are the violence in the country, the lack of stability and the cholera epidemic that is devastating the country. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251480">We have heard some solutions put forward: increased deployment of DART, a special envoy and increased coordination. However what I want to speak to is the crisis of what is being reported as happening to women. Compounding the mayhem and somewhat unreported is what is being called Haiti's unaddressed catastrophe, the violence against women.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251481">Research has been in place that has shown that, when there are catastrophes initiated by weather issues, gender has a profound impact. What we have seen, to give a bit of background, is that in 1980 with the eruption of Mount St. Helens, the police reported that domestic violence increased by 46%. Following the 1993 Missouri floods, the turn-away rates at shelters was over 110%, programs increased by 400% and more women and children were impacted by the floods than anticipated.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251482">In the ice storm in our own country, the Montreal police chief reported that 25% of the calls were related to domestic violence. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251483">What we have heard out of Haiti and what we have heard most eloquently from Taina Bien-Aimé, the executive director of the international women's rights organization Equality Now, who cites data from the U.S. Agency for International Development from 2006, is a direct link between humanitarian emergencies and the increased vulnerability of women and children to both sexual violence and exploitation.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251484">We know that in Haiti, where sex tourism and human trafficking were a prospering business before the earthquake, violence and this kind of activity has increased many times over. In Haiti with the government in a shambles, women are frequently defenceless and frequently unprotected.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251485">There are estimates that, prior to this situation, 72% of Haitian girls had been raped and 40% were victims of domestic violence. The havoc at play without the structures of government and the impact of cholera are widespread.</ParaText>

In Haiti, women come last in terms of protection from violence. One small example of the urgent need to establish special contingencies for women in post-earthquake intervention is underlined by images of men fist-fighting over UN-delivered food, while women, barely keeping hold of their babies, struggled in vain to reach the relief truck. Emergency assistance teams must ensure that coordinated security is in place to protect the most vulnerable and that the full participation of qualified women, in particular Haitian women, is secured to tackle gender issues in the response and management of disaster relief. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2251488">She went on to say:</ParaText><ParaText id="2251489"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Invariably, foreigners leave Haiti enchanted by the kindness, easy smile and resilience of its people. If we want to invest in Haiti's recovery through which prosperity and stability will replace despair and chaos, we must ensure that protective measures and security systems for women and children are in place.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2251490">Last September, the UN launched a new operation in Haiti to combat rape and gender-based violence. The UN police force of 200-strong were pressed into service in six of the high-risk camps sheltering 135,000 people. However, it also said at the time that it was impossible to assume complete security coverage in 1,300 camp, given the availability of forces from Haitian national police or the UN peacekeeping mission.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251491">It is important that Canada make this a priority. There are many issues to be addressed in Haiti, but the violence against women, the marginalization of women is of supreme importance. There must be coordination with local governments, with national governments and local stakeholders that are interested, particularly with issues pertinent to women. They must be given the top of mind and priority of purpose.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251492"> I urge my colleagues across the way, in all of their negotiations, both with partners in the process of trying to address some of these issues, to remember that the issues particular to women are singular and must be addressed in a coordinated way.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

							<ParaText id="2251506"> Almost a year after the earthquake, we are still a long way from achieving these objectives, as the current political crisis in Haiti so pointedly demonstrates. Let us take a moment to recall the work that Canada has already done in Haiti. In March 2010, at the International Donors Conference Towards a New Future for Haiti in New York, Canada committed $400 million over two years for the reconstruction of Haiti to support the Government of Haiti's action plan and priorities. This funding is on top of Canada's long-term development aid to Haiti of $550 million for the period 2006-11. The Government of Canada's total current commitment is over $1 billion, making Haiti the primary beneficiary of Canadian aid in the Americas, second only to Afghanistan globally.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251507"> Among the reconstruction initiatives announced by the Government of Canada, I would like to draw attention to the $30 million CIDA call for proposals from Canadian organizations in order to support short-term restoration and reconstruction projects in Haiti. CIDA also launched new initiatives, including the construction of temporary facilities for key Haitian government departments, a $12 million investment; the reconstruction of the Gonaïves hospital, $20 million; and the rebuilding of the Haitian National Police Academy, $18 million.</ParaText>

The Stabilization and Reconstruction Task Force, START, a Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade initiative, has increased its financial contribution in order to tailor its response to new areas of need resulting from the earthquake. The annual average allocation of $15 million has been increased to $25 million for 2010-11, thereby enabling the task force to ramp up its commitment in its traditional response areas of police reform and prison and border management, and to add justice to its list of priorities.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251509"> The task force is working on strengthening the Haitian National Police by deploying Canadian police officers to the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti, MINUSTAH, so that they can play a role in training their Haitian counterparts.</ParaText>

To start with, we are here to discuss Canada's role in Haiti after the devastating earthquake that reduced much of its capital, Port-au-Prince, to rubble and displaced many Haitians. To give members an idea, this was the worst earthquake in the region in more than 200 years. The estimated total cost of the disaster was between $7.2 billion and $13.2 billion, based on a death toll of anywhere from 200,000 to 250,000 people. In fact, there have been numbers later revised up to 300,000 people. Crushed buildings from the January earthquake still spill out onto the sidewalks. There is a cholera epidemic that has killed more than 1,000 people and stoked violent demonstrations against peacekeepers, and now, on top of all that, an election process that has thrown the country into even further destabilization.</ParaText>

They are clear about what they want to see. They want to see Canada take a leadership role to provide the stability that is necessary so we can get on with the work, in the short term, of saving lives; in the medium term, of helping rebuild the critical infrastructure that is required, not only from the earthquake but before that; and, in the long term, that we focus our energies and our support on rebuilding civil society so that it will be a country that will be able to have a democratic election, that will no longer be open to abuse, that will have important institutions and that will be able to withstand the conflicts that can occur.</ParaText>

Although we are from different political parties, some subjects transcend the normal partisanship in the House and the situation in Haiti is one of them. With the hon. member for Bourassa and the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128459" Type="2">Jeanne-Le Ber</Affiliation>, who came up with the idea, we have a committee made up of Canadian parliamentarians who are trying to begin to ensure that Canada's action on this issue is as relevant and meaningful as possible.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251640">That is why I am a bit confused by the off-putting and even aggressive tone we are hearing from the government side. This is very inappropriate for an emergency debate centred on finding solutions. We are not here to use that sort of tone. The Haitian people, courageous and proud people, have already experienced enough tragedy this year. Now is the time to engage in sober reflection and to begin to find solutions that will be beneficial in the long term.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251641">My colleague clearly summarized the issue: our current number one priority must be to continue to save lives. It does not make any sense. We are in the most economically developed part of the world. We live in the western hemisphere, what we call North and South America and western Europe. Nevertheless, in one country, hundreds of thousands of people are at risk of catching a disease that we thought had been relegated to the pages of history books: cholera. A number of people have already died from this disease. I know that Canada is doing its part. The government responded quickly and made sure that the public knew what it was doing. It proposed a fairly large fund in order to match any donations made by the public. This was an excellent way to go about it. But where are we now, almost a year later? That is the question we need to be asking ourselves.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251642">The elections have been much talked about. Let us take a hard look at the facts. We can talk about building democratic institutions, but if we are in Haiti to try to find a solution, then holding the elections in relative calm to ensure reliable results should have been a priority. That does not seem to have been the case, though. It is all well and good for the minister to say that he might not allow the result if something is found to have happened. Clearly, from what we have seen, heard and read, there were major problems with the election. But we need to remember that Haiti was the first country to free itself from slavery, so the last thing we want to do is treat Haiti like a colony.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251643">Haiti is and always will be free to make its own choices, even though we are all trying to help as best we can. Like everyone, I deplore the fact that the election results are ambiguous. At least, we cannot know whether the announcement that was made is accurate. But let us be clear: it is not up to Canada to decide for Haiti. The time for Canada to act was before the election, not after. We should have said we had resources, we would provide others as well, and we would bring in people who could organize and structure an election process that was as probative and reliable as possible.The thing to do is not to take action after the fact. In a way, what we are doing is blaming the victims, which is not the best approach. Even though Canada has done many very good things from the outset, this was not our finest hour. The minister launched an all-out attack on the ambiguous outcome, but that ambiguity is largely the fault of the government, which did not do enough with the other allies there.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251644">We must also start to rebuild. We must work with the civil society. Although I applaud the fact that the government created a fund to match public contributions, the public still needs objective information on the NGOs and groups that are transferring all of that money to Haiti.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="05">(2005)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2251645">Last year, I was disturbed to see some groups make official claims that people could come to them and trust them with respect to Haiti. They said that the money contributed would help Haiti but also other good causes in the world. I absolutely want them to support other causes, but the people who want to specifically help Haiti must have adequate information on the charities and NGOs that are managing all of this money to get through a crisis that is unique in the history of this part of the world.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251646">In the long term, we must help Haiti build its capacity in terms of infrastructure and governance. When I talk about infrastructure in a country that has experienced so many natural disasters in recent years, such as flooding and the earthquake that is the main issue today, we understand that general healthiness, something we have taken for granted for centuries, is not guaranteed there. Furthermore, hundreds of thousands of people still live in makeshift camps and are still dealing with terrible weather conditions.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251647">Clearly, Canada can continue to do its part. Earlier, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128153" Type="2">Bourassa</Affiliation> mentioned that a specific part of the armed forces may have left too soon. In any event, there are certainly solutions, and this might be the time to advocate for our priorities. They are wondering if the election is a priority. Perhaps they should have had the resources in place to avoid ambiguity and the current dispute. If soldiers and military personnel are being sent to a place like Haiti, it means that it is considered to be a priority relative to other activities.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251648">That is unfortunate. In the House, we decided to pull our soldiers out of Afghanistan in 2011. We would have liked that to have happened earlier. However, when the 2011 deadline was set, it was known that troops would be leaving Afghanistan at that time. Instead of having these men and women at our disposal to do this work in Haiti, thousands of them will still be in Afghanistan in the years ahead. That demonstrates how the government makes its choices and sets its priorities.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251649">The New Democratic Party feels that civil society has made the necessary effort. In Montreal, teams of men and women were trained by health and social service centres in the greater metropolitan area to ensure respect for the specific cultural context of those arriving, many of them in an advanced state of distress. Teams of psychologists greeted them at the airport, sometimes at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning. The public responded, and Canadians expressed a heartfelt desire to help their Haitian brothers and sisters. It is a top priority for all of us.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251650">Now we need to keep our promises. We have to set our priorities and continue to help.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

If people feel they are in that vulnerable a situation, they may have nothing left to lose, and that affects the situation.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251660">As well, by giving priority to organizing a proper first election round whose results everyone could have accepted, the violence of recent days could perhaps have been avoided. However, that has been added to everything else, because it was not made a priority and nobody got organized to set a different timetable. That is a problem that Canada contributed to by failing to prioritize what it should have prioritized.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251661">I want to stress one point. Whether it be DART or something else, there are very high calibre people in our military, but if our priority is to be in a combat mission in Afghanistan, there will not be enough people physically left to do the rest of the work in the case of crises like in Haiti.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Bev Oda (Minister of International Cooperation, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2251662">Mr. Speaker, our government is very concerned about the recent events taking place in Haiti, the most impoverished country in the Americas even before this past January. Our thoughts continue to be with the people of Haiti as they struggle with each destabilizing event that they face.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251663">The Government of Canada and the people of Canada remain committed to helping the Haitian people as they rebuild their lives after the earthquake and are now fighting the cholera epidemic, and peaceful political dialogue is essential for Haiti to emerge from the current political crisis. Canada calls on all individuals involved in the Haiti electoral process to prioritize peace and the best interests of the population. Allow me to bring the House up to date on our development work in Haiti.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251664">First, since the terrible earthquake, Canada has responded swiftly and effectively with immediate humanitarian assistance including food aid for 4.4 million people and emergency housing and supplies for 2.2 million people. Since then, we have responded to the critical needs caused by the cholera epidemic. While the recent political unrest has caused some disruption in providing medical care to those affected, the rate of infection is finally slowing.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251665">On December 2, the Pan American Health Organization said that in-hospital case fatality rates have dropped from 9% at the beginning of the outbreak to 3.2% now. We must continue to work to stabilize the spread of disease and prevent further deaths. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251666">With 11 months having passed since the earthquake, we can say that progress is being made in Haiti; however, the process of rebuilding will be slow. The pace of reconstruction left many more vulnerable to the onset of cholera. Medical experts estimate that Haiti will have approximately 400,000 cases of cholera over the next year, with 200,000 cases occurring over the next three months. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251667">Northern Haiti remains the area with the highest caseload. Hastened by inadequate sanitary conditions in many parts of Haiti after the earthquake, the devastating progress of the disease grew worse because of the heavy rains brought on by Hurricane Tomas. Now in addition, civil unrest in the north since November 15 has unfortunately slowed some activities in response to the outbreak. I cannot emphasize strongly enough that the situation in Haiti remains very serious. Canada is working with all who are on the ground in Haiti to respond to these multiple challenges. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251668">Before I give some examples of what Canada is helping to achieve, I would like to inform the Speaker that I am splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="128322" Type="2">Beauport—Limoilou</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251669">The Canadian International Development Agency is working with five experienced partners in response to the UN appeal for assistance. These partners are the Pan American Health Organization or PAHO, UNICEF, World Vision Canada, Médecins du Monde Canada and Oxfam Canada. They are working together to ensure that Haitians benefit from coordinated, effective and proven interventions that get to the people who need it.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251670">There are currently some 70 organizations coordinated through the UN-led health cluster responding to the epidemic. PAHO is overseeing the coordination, establishing cholera treatment centres, providing technical assistance to help authorities and implementing disease surveillance. UNICEF is coordinating the national water and sanitation response and material and logistical support for the treatment centres, training national health care workers, providing sanitation services for schools in residential child care facilities, as well as implementing a national information campaign on cholera prevention measures. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251671">Oxfam-Québec is providing emergency water and sanitation service for health facilities and affected communities. With the Government of Canada's support, World Vision Canada will provide up to 120,000 cholera patients with life-saving treatment in specialized health facilities and provide additional families with access to clean water and the necessary supplies to slow the spread of cholera in Port-au-Prince, La Gonave and along the border with the Dominican Republic.</ParaText>

It will also provide further training on cholera treatment and prevention measures to community-based and hospital health workers. CIDA is also working with partners on the ground previously funded for earthquake relief to respond to the cholera epidemic. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251673">I am pleased that, after our request, the Canadian Red Cross has deployed part of its newly-created emergency field hospital, created with CIDA's support, to Haiti. The treatment centre is now up and running in Port-au-Prince with Canadian health professionals.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251674">As the first of its kind in the Americas, it is already providing a timely response to urgent needs. Services are being provided through cholera treatment centres, treatment units and oral rehydration centres. Individual and community-based prevention measures such as the distribution of soap, water purification tablets and rehydration salts are ongoing. Tens of thousands of litres of chlorinated water are being sent to affected areas. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251675">I remind the House that Haiti was the poorest country in the Americas prior to the earthquake. When the earthquake hit, it was devastating; 26 out of 28 government department buildings were destroyed, thousands of people lost their homes and livelihoods, children lost their schools, medical facilities were lost as well as basic services and infrastructure, and roads were not passable. The poorest situations existed before the earthquake and then came the cholera epidemic. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251676">The cholera epidemic is now being fought by all NGOs that are there currently working on the earthquake as well as the cholera epidemic. There is a capacity problem. There is again a problem with the destruction of infrastructure and facilities and a medical system that is virtually all being provided by the international community. Canada continues to work within the model set out internationally and agreed to by the government of Haiti, a sovereign country.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251677">I can assure everyone that the Government of Canada continues to monitor the situation very closely to help ensure that the needs are being met even under these most difficult circumstances.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

They had to work with the local community.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251684">We know some of the challenges. Cholera is new to this population, so they are unaware of the disease itself.

Seeing such a poor country was culture shock for me. Following the earthquake on January 12, the international community was quick to respond to the Haitian people's immediate needs. The Montreal conference last January demonstrated that the international community and Haitian government acknowledged the mistakes of the past and wanted to start fresh.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251697">The adoption of the Montreal principles confirmed this desire to take a different approach to building a new Haiti. The action plan presented by the Haitian government at the New York conference in March was another step in this direction, as it identified the priorities for rebuilding Haiti.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251698">The Haitian people often express their lack of trust in Haitian authorities. This displeasure is due to the government's inability to provide basic services, chronic political instability and the authorities' inability to fight corruption. There is also the issue of brain drain. In fact, the government struggles to keep university graduates in the public service because of more attractive opportunities with international organizations in Haiti or abroad.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251699">The earthquake only exacerbated the situation. In fact, nearly 30% of the public service was killed and 40% of the country's infrastructure was destroyed, including many government buildings.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251700">In a situation such as that in Haiti currently, international aid is quite often given directly to NGOs rather than to the government, which hinders the Haitian government's ability to develop its capacities and carry out its responsibilities towards its people. We need to reverse this trend.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251701">The democratic process is also the key to restoring public confidence in Haitian institutions. That is why the current elections in the country represent a significant milestone for Canada. The new government will be leading the country through the next critical phase. That is why it is so important for Canada that the Haitian political players take their responsibilities and make a firm commitment toward democratic principles, namely respect for the integrity of the electoral process. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251702">Eleven months after the earthquake, justice and security system reform are the core of Canada's commitment. We are the top donors to Haiti's correctional system reform. The Department of Foreign Affairs, through the Stabilization and Reconstruction Task Force, has allocated $51 million for projects in support of security system reform in Haiti since 2006. The average annual allocation of $15 million has been increased to $25 million for 2010-11.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251703">Despite these investments, major gaps remain. The capacity of the Haitian national police force was reinforced, but it still depends largely on support from MINUSTAH. The legal system also has major shortcomings. Many unwarranted preventive detention cases are being filed because of a lack of infrastructure, material resources and qualified staff.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251704">The deployment of up to 150 Canadian police officers to MINUSTAH and the renovation and construction of new institutions to provide adequate detention space for prisoners are among the measures Canada has taken to improve the situation.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251705">Canada also plays a leading role in border control by providing equipment, infrastructure and training. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251706">Canada also supports various work and training initiatives for people wanting to take part in the reconstruction.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="30">(2030)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2251707">These initiatives also serve to strengthen co-operation among the community, the Haitian national police and MINUSTAH.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251708">Haiti has always been vulnerable to natural disasters and epidemics, a situation that has been exacerbated by the government's inability to provide the public with basic services. Haitian social services are the most privatized in the Americas. Over 80% of basic services, particularly education and health services, are provided through NGOs and the private sector. The current cholera epidemic demonstrates the importance of implementing a health care system that is able to meet the public's basic needs. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251709">It is encouraging to note that, during the current crisis, the department of public health and population has been able to demonstrate a certain amount of leadership, within its jurisdiction, in coordinating the response to the crisis. However, the Government of Canada is still deeply concerned by the continuing spread of cholera in Haiti. The number of people affected by this epidemic once again demonstrates the importance of international support.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251710">The Government of Canada reacted quickly by contributing $7 million to organizations on the ground. This makes Canada one of the leading donor countries in the fight against cholera in Haiti. We will continue to maintain contact with Haitian government officials and humanitarian partners working in Haiti.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251711">In conclusion, with regard to Haiti's future, it is important to reconcile the pressure to obtain quick results with the need to strengthen the capacities of the Haitian state. Although it is important to achieve quick results in some sectors, strengthening Haiti's institutions will be a difficult process that is bound to take time. Canada will monitor the situation closely to ensure that these two aspects remain on the agenda.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251712">I would like to wish Canadian observers the best of luck during these violent times in both the short and long terms.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

As all of these things have been going on with Haiti, she has been keeping me updated, which I know she has with others as well. That is a very good situation and I appreciate that kind of co-operation. It also is a difficult situation, because we get to realize just how serious the implications are for Haiti and what is going on.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251722">I have a few things that I would like to speak of specifically concerning an idea, or suggestions, that might help us with the Haiti situation.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251723"> I am very much aware that when the tsunami struck in 2005, at a similar time of year, there were a lot of lessons to be learned from that, but it was half a world away. It was very difficult and I am not sure we learned them very well. When the Haiti situation happened this last January, there was a belief that we would get this one right, in part because it was on our doorstep, in part because it was a country of focus. From our initial reaction to what happened after the earthquake and others, it seemed to be moving along that line, but it was not so much to do with any one particular country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251724"> I remember being in New York at the United Nations with the minister. Bill Clinton was there and he was supposedly helping to direct a coordinated response worldwide for this. I remember talking to a number of Haitians at that conference, especially civil society leaders, who realized that to a certain degree they were being included, but their worry was that although everybody was talking about a 10-year process in which these people could be helped, really the focus was being put on the short-term relief. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251725">They were having great difficulty in trying to get in to discuss how the problems Haiti is facing now are the problems that it has always faced. They were not looking to be popularized and beatified and told what wonderful people they were. They realize they have their own problems, but they also realize that long-term development is actually what is going to make it work.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251726">As well, part of what my concern is, and many of us who follow the environmental file know this, is that this will not be the last thing that confronts Haiti. We know that these things, if the scientists are correct, likely will increasingly begin to snowball in places like Haiti and therefore just as we are recovering from one thing, we will get hit with another. That is what has been happening in the course of these last few months, making it very difficult for Canada or any other government to know how to respond.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251727">The anniversary is coming up in January. I was in Sudan when it happened but I remember I came back and people were very much moved and wanted to do something. Since that time, there has been some confusion. With the anniversary coming up, a lot of emphasis is going to be placed upon that confusion, and I do not mean just about the matched money that was supposed to happen. I do think people are confused there and would sure appreciate clarification, but internationally, we still have not developed a system that is capable of responding to this situation, Bill Clinton aside. Let us face it, if this would have happened in Togo or someplace like that, it would not have had nearly the interest that Haiti did. We have to be prepared for other disasters in other parts of the world.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251728">Regarding CIDA especially, part of the problem we have with CIDA is twofold: emergency relief and long-term development. These things are very difficult and all of a sudden, as we are moving along in development, a disaster happens such as Haiti and we have to take away so many of our resources in order to focus on that. I remember the first time the minister gave me a briefing, it was shortly after it happened. She was exhausted and she was just trying to keep up with both sides of CIDA to keep it going.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251729">I would like to suggest something more along the lines of the British model. I know that in Canada we have a group called The Humanitarian Coalition, made up of four major NGOs, that has been trying for some time to develop a coordinated response among NGOs for both long-term development and especially toward international relief. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251730">In Britain, 35 years ago, a whole bunch of these groups all came together, along with the British government, and decided that probably the best thing that it could do to help its international development program within government was to bring a bunch of the NGOs together and hold a competition of 16 of the main ones, all with different skills, some in health, some in water, some in building, those kinds of things. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251731">These groups would come together and then they would work all year long, and they did not just work among themselves. They worked with the media, so the BBC was a huge part of it, three different channels of the BBC. Newspapers and others were part of it. They brought universities onside. They brought the private sector onside, and for 35 years that system has run, and when a disaster happens, these people have already been prepared.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="40">(2040)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2251732">When the crisis in Haiti first happened, there were 10,000 NGOs in Haiti within the first month. I realize that a lot of those were Haitian NGOs, but the point is that it was a nightmare to try to coordinate all those groups.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251733">I wonder whether it would not be a good idea for CIDA and the Department of Foreign Affairs to consider building on the British model. The British are all ready with humanitarian relief. They know they are going to get so much money from the government, though it depends somewhat on the nature of the emergency. These people meet on an ongoing basis. Having been in London, England, I know free pamphlets can be picked up on bookshelves. The pamphlets give a 1-800 number to call if someone wants to donate. These pamphlets tell how that donation will be matched. It is all done in advance and they are very much ready when these emergencies happen. What they have really stressed is the coordination of information for the average citizen.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251734">I think we have had some problems in that regard with respect to the situation in Haiti. It is not just a Canadian problem. It is an American problem and it is a problem for other countries as well, because it is such a nightmare to handle.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251735">The British version of the humanitarian coalition constantly communicates with people the difference between relief and development. We are caught between these two things with respect to Haiti. We know that we have to get on with development and we have to start building infrastructure and other things, but then along comes flooding and then along comes cholera and it gets very difficult to do it. The NGOs are expressing confusion themselves about what to do.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251736">I do not mean this to sound too negative, but often NGOs will chase after where the funding goes. I do not doubt that it is an important and necessary thing to do, but in the British system of humanitarian coalition, it works out the funding well in advance so that this kind of competition is not happening when the money is suddenly made available from the government. Not everybody is rushing in and trying to dominate the situation.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251737">The best NGOs are meant to come forward and say why they deserve to be part of this NGO coalition for emergency relief and development. That particular group has a relationship with DFID, the British version of CIDA. The relationship is ongoing, with monthly meetings being held. They are doing something now that is going to expand that even further and I think it is something that Canada needs to look at. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251738">We are not like Britain. We are a broad country in terms of our ability to put together information mechanisms and empowerment mechanisms for average citizens such that if they give money towards a certain group and it is supposed to be matched, they are not left waiting and wondering whether it has been done or not. These things are worked out in advance in Britain.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251739">I would like to tell the minister and the <Affiliation DbId="163759" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> that there is nothing wrong in looking at the British type of system for Canada so that if something is happening in Haiti, it will not stop other things from happening. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251740">This group is constantly working on it and coordinating it. They make sure that people have the 1-800 number so that, as soon as something happens, a person just has to phone that number and the humanitarian coalition in Britain will sort out where the funding goes on the basis of need as determined by the government and international organizations.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251741">Personally, I think it is a better system than what we have at present. We have just cobbled together what we have had over the last number of years. The tsunami was a big lesson to the Liberals, and Haiti is a big lesson to all of us that something more co-ordinated needs to happen.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251742">At this intersection between emergency relief and development, it is very important that we find a group of NGOs who can work in harmony with CIDA, who can sit down and work for that intersection, who would know what needs to be done in Haiti because they have already studied it. We know it is going to happen again in Haiti. The British have studied it and have the disciplines in the various sectors, and as soon as a disaster happens, the BBC and the others all get the information out there. People know what number to call, and immediately the government and the coalition get back with the information that people are looking for. It is not a perfect system, but I think it is better than what we have.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251743">What I am trying to put forward here, and I appreciate the opportunity, is that Haiti has been bigger than all of us. It has swallowed all of us up because it is such a complex problem. We ought to get some people on it who are more full time and would be willing to lead us in that direction. I would encourage the government to consider this suggestion. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="2251760">However, it is important to North Americans for Haiti to find a solution because of our proximity to that country and because of the number of Haitians living in Canada and the United States. Canada has always been prepared to answer the call when its friends and allies are in need.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="2251761">There are literally thousands of Canadians who have family ties to Haiti, and these Canadians want us to live up to our reputation and take decisive action to help steer Haiti out of this crisis that threatens to tear the country apart.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="2251762">These people are my constituents, my neighbours, my friends, and we cannot abandon them.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="2251763">From the introduction of peacekeeping on the world stage by Lester Pearson to the introduction of the responsibility to protect doctrine in the UN by Paul Martin, Canada has always led when crisis threatened to tear lives apart. We invented peacekeeping and we invented the responsibility to protect doctrine; and since we have such a close relationship with Haiti, strengthened by bonds of family and friendship, Canada must rally the world to come together and lift Haiti out of the mire it is currently stuck in.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251764">Regardless of party affiliation, Canadian governments have always stood for peace, justice, strong moral principles and a vigorous engagement in world affairs. As a Liberal who greatly admires the accomplishments of leaders such as Pearson, Trudeau, Chrétien and Martin, leaders who took the principles of their predecessors and built upon them with new ideas and initiatives, I know that Canada's role in Haiti should be as an unwavering partner who will propose constructive ideas, back up our promises and convince other nations to join us in fighting the good fight. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251765">We need our actions to make a difference. We must succeed; we cannot afford to fail. The future and the life of an entire generation of people hangs in the balance and we cannot fail them.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251766">The word most often used to describe the Haitian population is “resilience”. History has proven that. Many say that Haiti has just had a string of bad luck. Others say that it is cultural, and others say it is a curse. One thing is for sure, Haitians are fighters and they need our help now more than ever to continue fighting. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251767">In my constituency, I see how proud Haitian Canadians are of their culture and heritage, and they are all proud Canadians. But when it comes to the Haitian community, like most ethnic communities, agreement on the nature of the problems they face, never mind the solutions, are never unanimous.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251768">We had two round tables in the span of a few months with the Haitian community in Saint-Michel, in the east end of Montreal, right after the earthquake. Many problems were highlighted, and of course, there were differences in analyzing just the problems. Right away, there were differences along political lines. We also had gender differences: the women blamed it on the men, and the men obviously blamed it on the women. There were generational differences, where the young blamed it on the old and the old blamed it on the young. Finally, there were also people who blamed it on the fact that they had left 30 years ago or they had just left five years ago, and there were differences from that perspective.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251769">Solutions proposed were broken down between short term and long term. Short-term problems immediately following the earthquake were simply finding shelter and food for those most in need. Long-term solutions dealt with infrastructure for such things as roads, bridges, water and sewage; but the other infrastructure problem that needed to be dealt with was the government, because citizens everywhere in the world rely on their government to some degree. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251770">We should look around us in Canada. Everyday services are delivered. We have health care and simple things such as garbage collection. If we look outside, it is snowing in Ottawa. We have snow removal, police services, post office, licences, and so on. Canadians may complain about the cost or the delivery of those services, but even the Conservatives, who despise government, agree that we need government to deliver some services. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251771">In Canada, we debate the amount of services that the government should deliver. In Haiti, the debate is which government can actually provide the minimal amount of services. We are talking about a government that cannot deliver the basic services. We are talking about a government where, when individuals go to get their birth certificate, it is not available. When they try to get their passport, there is nobody at the counter. When they try to mail a letter, they cannot get a postage stamp. When they go to make a deposit, they cannot find a bank that is open. When they try to withdrawal money at a bank, there is no money in the bank. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251772">Those are basic services. Canada is a stable, successful democracy with a good track record of providing essential services to the population, regardless of which political party is in power. Today we are debating how we, as a successful and prosperous country, can assist Haiti in taking steps toward becoming a successful and prosperous country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251773">Haitians' political history is full of traumatic upheavals. Regime after regime in Haiti engaged in grossly corrupt activities that put the ambitions of those in power before the needs of the people. This has led to Haiti being underdeveloped, but what is more troubling is that this has diminished the ability of any political force to bring about the change necessary to put Haiti on a path towards sustainable development. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="55">(2055)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2251774">There needs to be a shift in Haiti's political culture to ensure that the old ways of doing business that have failed are replaced by new good practices that make it possible for Haiti to govern itself successfully and democratically.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251775">To succeed in its reconstruction effort, Haiti needs an overhaul that brings stability, rule of law and a trust in its political system. We can see clearly in the protests taking place daily that there is no trust between Haiti's democratic institutions and her people.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251776"> Trust must be established so that any political force that forms a government after an election has the moral authority to actually lead the country. People will not follow a government that they view as illegitimate. Until legitimacy is woven into the Haitian political fabric, there can be no lasting peace or progress.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251777">There is tremendous desire in Haiti to rebuild and move forward. The spirit of the Haitian people is not in question. What is required right now is to stop the chaos that threatens to tear Haiti apart. This cannot be done without the world being involved.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251778"> What is needed now is action to shore up Haiti's democracy and aid. Proper democratic institutions are not built overnight, but they are necessary to create a climate where a state can govern itself successfully, develop its resources, deliver services and change governments in a stable and orderly fashion.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251779">Right now, Haitians are divided and angry because they feel that their democratic institutions are illegitimate. This feeling is the wound that must be closed if Haiti is to survive. Until that wound is closed, aid must flow to Haiti. Aid is a bandage, not a solution, but the bleeding must stop before the wound can be stitched.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251780">Food, clean water, medicine, money, clothing and shelter, everything and anything at this point can contribute to reducing the suffering that is currently ravaging Haiti. The rebuilding process begins with aid. If aid can be delivered fairly and efficiently, it can create the calm space and good will between the Haitian people, the Haitian government and the international community, which is necessary to begin tackling more systemic problems.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251781">Success breeds success. We need to get aid right and use that momentum to tackle the deeper issues I mentioned, and keep doing this until Haiti is ready to stand on her own two feet.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251782">Given Canada's deep ties to Haiti, I ask the government to do whatever it can to assist Haiti by collaborating with our partners to provide lifesaving aid to Haiti during this difficult time and to do the work with the Haitian people and the international community to build democratic institutions in Haiti that work.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Understandably, those on the ground immediately following the disaster had to deal with missing loved ones, friends and colleagues and their supreme efforts must not go unnoticed or be forgotten.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251796">Canada has a long-term commitment to Haiti and there is no other country that has been a better friend to the people of Haiti than Canada. Our strong, long-term relationship with Haiti strengthens our ties to the Organization of American States, the Caribbean community, the common market and key countries in the Americas, such as Brazil and Chile. Canadians care about Haiti. This is our hemisphere and we have family and personal ties there. It is also the poorest country in the hemisphere.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251797">I had an opportunity to visit Haiti in 2006, well before the latest disasters struck. It was at the time, even then, the poorest country in the western hemisphere. At the time, elections were being conducted and were reasonably well managed, although the turnout was relatively low. Of note, even at that time the Haitian people had many desperate needs, with massive unemployment and civil unrest. The Haitian government was unable to cope with its country's human needs, coupled with large foreign debt, without massive amounts of foreign aid.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251798">The countryside was denuded of foliage, creating widespread flooding in seasonal rains, bringing the remaining soil and silt and filling up the only substantial power damn, preventing the generation of electricity. Then the earthquake hit and now a cholera outbreak.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251799">Haiti is vulnerable to natural disasters, as last January's earthquake and hurricane Thomas this fall attest. In addition, the current cholera outbreak has already resulted in the death of more than 2,000 Haitians and has reached the Dominican Republic and Florida as well. It is important to remember that rebuilding Haiti is a significant undertaking that will require a sustained international effort measurable in years, not in weeks and months.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251800">While great needs remain, Canadian initiatives are making a difference in the lives of Haitians. Despite the extraordinary challenges Haiti has faced in the past year, our commitment to Haiti is long term. I am proud to say that Canadians themselves have demonstrated unprecedented support for Haiti in response to the earthquake that took place nearly a year ago. In fact, they donated $220 million to charitable organizations and the Government of Canada is matching their donations. Almost 60% of the matched funding has been allocated to initiatives in Haiti.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251801"> The international response has ensured that immediate lifesaving needs following the earthquake are being addressed. Canada is the second most important bilateral donor in Haiti after the United States. We have a long-term credible presence in Haiti that allows us to respond quickly and effectively when disaster occurs. For example, our health partners were instrumental in the early detection of the current cholera outbreak. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251802">Canada's leadership, expertise and development assistance are valued by Haiti and the United States, as well as other key partners in this hemisphere. In fact, our credibility with Haiti lends us influence in new mechanisms set up for the coordination of humanitarian and reconstruction efforts such as the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission and the multi-donor Haiti reconstruction fund.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251803">With a commitment of $1 billion over six years between 2006 and 2012, Haiti is Canada's leading development recipient in the Americas. Our long-term presence in Haiti means that throughout the country we have trusted partners to work with and mobilize in the event of a disaster. The situation in Haiti is too large and multi-faceted for Canada to make a difference alone, so we are working to ensure that our efforts and those of other partners are mutually reinforcing.</ParaText>

Our efforts have drawn on the skills of a number of departments, including the Canadian International Development Agency, the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Finance Canada, the Canadian Border Services Agency, the RCMP and the Department of National Defence to achieve results for the people of Haiti.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251806">On our response to the devastating effects of the earthquake nearly a year ago, Canada has now fully disbursed more than $150 million in immediate humanitarian assistance, contributing to the distribution of food aid for 4.3 million people and emergency housing and supplies to 2.2 million people. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251807">Through our $400 million commitment, Canada is supplying daily meals to 400,000 school children, has provided $31.3 million to the multi-donor Haiti reconstruction fund and has earmarked $30 million for a call for proposals from Canadian organizations for short-term recovery and reconstruction projects in Haiti.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251808">Some Haitian municipalities will receive technical assistance from the Federation of Canadian Municipalities to improve their delivery of basic services, such as land management, roads, water provisions and garbage collection.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251809">Here are some of the results that we and our partners have achieved since the earthquake struck on January 12: one million Haitians have been engaged in cash for work programs; over four million Haitians have received emergency food aid; we have provided medical care for 90% of displaced persons in Port-au-Prince; we have constructed temporary offices for the ministries of health and agriculture and for the secretariat of the interim Haiti recovery commission; and we have constructed a prison for 750 inmates and have deployed 25 Canadian prison experts.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251810">We are now on track to meet the commitment we made at the International Donors' Conference in New York in March. However, there have been some challenges. As 30% of the public service died in the earthquake and 40% of the Haitian government's infrastructure was damaged, this has hampered the government's ability to respond to the basic needs of the population.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251811">When assessing progress in Haiti, we need to remember the magnitude of the devastation and remember how long it took to rebuild in other similar situations. We all remember the tsunami in Asia. Following that disaster in 2004, right around Christmas time I might add, it took over five years to rebuild 139,000 houses in Indonesia. In fact, we need look no further than our closest neighbour when we want an example of how long reconstruction can take. As we all know, the United States of America, with all of the resources possible at its disposal, is still working to reconstruct New Orleans in the aftermath of Katrina.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251812">Governance challenges in Haiti have been compounded by the current land tenure system and the lack of safe landfill sites to remove rubble from Port-au-Prince. Part of the reason that more than one million people still live in camps is that hey have no other place to go. Canada supports efforts to address these issues and continues to encourage the government of Haiti to undertake the needed reforms to clear the way for rebuilding.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251813">Canada has been clear on our commitment to Haiti and it is long term.

Despite all the problems they are currently going through, with the earthquake, cholera and problems surrounding the elections, I hope that these people will continue to have the resilience they need to get through this.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251820">I want to know whether the hon. member shares this same hope and this same confidence that the Haitian people inspire in me.

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Kent" id="3672589"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128722" Type="4">Hon. Peter Kent (Minister of State of Foreign Affairs (Americas), CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2251823">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to take the floor tonight to speak to the United Nations stabilization force in Haiti and to the critical support provided by the Government of Canada in this very important operation.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251824">As this government has said before, our vision for Haiti is a country built on foundations of peace, security, rule of law and economic prosperity. This is a vision shared by the international community. The United Nations stabilization mission in Haiti, or MINUSTAH, as it is known by its acronym, is one of the most important manifestations of the international community's commitment to Haiti's stabilization and reconstruction.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251825">Canada remains strongly committed to MINUSTAH. This has been a priority mission since it was established in 2004. Prior to the earthquake, Canada was already contributing high level Canadian Forces support and a number of civilian police officers and corrections experts to the mission. Since the earthquake, we have deployed even more support. Indeed, MINUSTAH now represents the largest number of civilians deployed to a mission outside of Afghanistan. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251826">Canada recognizes MINUSTAH's continuing efforts in Haiti and the role of the United Nations in coordinating the international response. Since 2004, MINUSTAH has contributed to the overall improvement of the security situation in Haiti, including by playing a crucial role in managing the current security situation following Haiti's most recent elections.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251827">MINUSTAH was established as a multi-dimensional, integrated mission, combining both military and civilian functions. The Security Council has provided MINUSTAH with a robust mandate under chapter 7 of the UN charter, which allows for the use of force in its implementation.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251828">As a member of the Group of Friends of Haiti at the UN, Canada worked closely with Brazil and other countries committed to MINUSTAH to play an important role in the drafting of the resolution and renewing the mission mandate adopted by the Security Council in October of this year. MINUSTAH is also protecting civilians, supporting the political process in Haiti, professionalizing the Haitian national police and reforming the justice and security system reform.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251829">MINUSTAH has also faced difficulties. The events of January 12 of this year took a heavy toll on the mission. Some 101 UN personnel perished in the Haiti earthquake, the largest losses to a UN mission in a single event. The victims included the special representative of the UN secretary-general, Hédi Annabi, and eight Canadians serving in police and civilian roles in MINUSTAH.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251830">Despite those losses, the mission carried on, making valuable contributions to the relief effort and working with the government of Haiti and the international community to mitigate the effects of the disaster on Haiti's people. Canada has commended MINUSTAH for its efforts and has consistently encouraged it to continue to work for and with the Haitian population.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251831">After the earthquake, the UN secretary-general requested additional resources for MINUSTAH, including police, to strengthen the mission's work in Haiti. Canada supported this request for more resources in these dire circumstances. Moreover, we provided additional personnel to the mission, something I will return to momentarily.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251832">These additional personnel were necessary both in the post-earthquake context and in the lead-up to the Haitian elections in November, giving MINUSTAH a role in both. MINUSTAH's authorized uniform strength currently remains at 8,940 troops and 4,391 civilian police, alongside 1,900 civilians.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251833">In his latest report on MINUSTAH in September of this year, the UN secretary-general further noted that, “Consolidating any gains in Haiti will depend in large part on sustained support from the international community, including to MINUSTAH”.<Quote><QuotePara Align="Left"><Query></Query></QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2251834">The secretary-general also recommended maintaining mission staff at its current level until the security environment has been assessed after the inauguration of a new president and the new government. Canada supported this cautious approach, as did the UN Security Council. Under the current mission mandate, the numbers of military and police personnel have been maintained.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="20">(2120)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2251835">In addition, the Security Council asked the Secretary-General to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the security situation following the election and the transfer of power to a new government in 2011.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251836">The Secretary-General's report also underscored the importance of the authority given to MINUSTAH to provide direct logistical support and technical expertise to Haitian officials, though this authority is temporary. Because the earthquake dealt a serious blow to Haiti's bureaucracy and the state infrastructure, Canada agreed with the importance of allowing MINUSTAH to continue to play this role until other support mechanisms can take over.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251837">Canada has been clear that this temporary direct support must be part of a process of constructive co-operation with the host government that strives, through training and mentoring, to build that government's capacity to maintain stability and to deliver services to its citizens.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251838">Our government is committed to keeping our activities aligned with Haitian priorities with a view to transitioning back all governance functions to Haitian authorities once the interim need has passed.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251839">In this vein, Canada supports the continuation of MINUSTAH's work to strengthen Haiti's justice and security systems in the areas of police, corrections and border services, to provide complementary support to MINUSTAH's work in this area. The assistance provided by the stabilization and reconstruction task force, known by its acronym START, through the global peace and security fund in Haiti, focuses primarily on the reform of the justice and security system.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251840">Since 2006, Canada has provided nearly $72 million to fund the purchase of equipment to allow the Haitian national police to patrol on land and on sea for the construction of facilities for both Haitian police and corrections officers, as well as to provide funding for the improvement of community security and the re-establishment of the justice system.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251841">Canada believes that MINUSTAH will continue to play a vital role as we collectively work to put Haiti back on the path toward long-term prosperity. For this reason, Canada is proud to contribute significantly to MINUSTAH. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251842">After the earthquake, Canada increased the number of police officers available for deployment. Up to 150 police have been authorized for deployment under the Canadian police arrangement. As of this month, there are 132 Canadian police officers serving in Haiti under this arrangement, including the MINUSTAH deputy police commissioner for operations.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251843">Canada also increased its capacity to deploy officers from the Correctional Service of Canada to MINUSTAH to up to 25. Seventeen officers are currently serving in Haiti thanks to DFAIT's global peace and security fund.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251844">In addition, the Canadian Forces deployed an additional five staff officers initially for six months. The Minister of National Defence recently announced the extension of this deployment to April 2011.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251845">The Government of Canada's support to MINUSTAH is another clear example of the priority we give to the people of Haiti. This support is mirrored by our partners in the hemisphere whose contributions demonstrate the importance of the continent's solidarity for the sustainable development of Haiti.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251846">We believe that this unique engagement is opening a new era of hemispheric co-operation. Thus, the Government of Canada will remain strongly committed to MINUSTAH, including by continuing to deploy police, corrections and Canadian Forces personnel to the mission by continuing to play a key role in the Group of Friends of Haiti in New York, which helps to develop MINUSTAH's mandate, and by supporting key projects to assist the consolidation of Haiti's police, correctional services, border management and justice sectors, in order to complement and to support MINUSTAH in these areas.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

By way of background and to give some idea of the problems the country faces, I will quote some statistics concerning the earthquake in Haiti.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251862">The earthquake on January 12 caused damage on an unprecedented scale. Estimates put the number of dead at 222,570 and the number of injured at 300,000. Approximately 1.3 million people are living in temporary shelters in the Port-au-Prince area, and 600,000 have left the earthquake-damaged areas to take refuge elsewhere.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251863">The Haitian government was severely crippled by the earthquake. It is estimated that more than 60% of government, administrative and economic infrastructure was destroyed. Haiti does not have a large government, yet one-third of the 60,000 public servants were killed in the earthquake. Half of Haiti's 8,500 prison inmates escaped. One hundred and one UN employees who were in the country when the earthquake struck lost their lives.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251864">The court house, the justice department, the public security department and the legislature were destroyed. More than 105,000 homes were destroyed and more than 208,000 were damaged. One and a half million people found themselves homeless. Nearly 4,000 Haitian students died, 1,234 schools were destroyed and 2,500 were damaged. The damage is estimated at $7.9 billion, and 70% was suffered by the private sector.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251865">It is estimated that Haiti needs $11.5 billion, including 50% for social services, 17% for infrastructure and housing, and 15% for the environment and risk management. The Red Cross is working to help Haitians: 80,000 households have received temporary accommodation, 95,000 patients have received medical care and 90,000 m<Sup>3</Sup> of water has been distributed to 118 sites.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251866">I wanted to provide this overview to remind members of how serious these events are. In our era, we live with the ever-present media, online, in real time and on the news networks. We are touched and struck by events, and after that, whether we like it or not, they dissipate and we stop thinking about them. That is the risk for any crisis in the world and it is also the case for Haiti. I think it is a good idea to remind ourselves of the seriousness of what has happened there. Then, there is what came after: the recent cholera outbreak, which is another problem for the people of Haiti, as though they needed that. Then there are the issues and considerations pertaining to the legislative and presidential elections, as well as the unrest and climate of violence they have caused.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251867">I will quote Dany Laferrière. You may know of him, Madam Chair. He is a Quebec author of Haitian origin. He is famous in Quebec and throughout la Francophonie. He said that Quebec has everything except for independence and that Haiti has nothing, except for independence. This turn of phrase reminds us that Haitians took charge of themselves long ago. They are an independent people who can decide their own destiny.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="35">(2135)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2251868">This independence is meaningless unless they are truly masters of their own destiny, which requires that they choose their leaders. In my opinion, this need to choose one's leaders is the very essence of democracy and independence for a country. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251869">In light of all of Haiti's current difficulties, I cannot help but send my best regards to the Haitian people, who are the brothers and sisters of the Quebec people. More than 90% of Haitian nationals and the Haitian diaspora in Canada live in Quebec. It is the only nation in the Americas, together with Quebec, that has French as its common public language and official language. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251870">The current problems surrounding the presidential election must not overshadow the fact that democracy and the governance of the Haitian state do not rest solely with the president, or rather, should not rest solely with the president, as is currently the case.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251871">As I mentioned earlier today, in 2006, I had the opportunity to take part in a parliamentary mission to meet with Haitian parliamentarians in the context of legislative elections. At the time, I noted that the difference between the magnificent presidential palace, on a beautiful green lawn, and the legislative building, an old tourism office where parliamentarians were crammed in on top of one another, illustrated the importance given to the presidency in the minds of many Haitians, or at least in the spirit of how that country engages in politics at this time, in other words, the disproportionate importance given to the presidency.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251872">Basically, all we are hearing about is the Haitian presidency, the three candidates who are fighting for it and the problems this is causing for the second round. I hope that current events will not keep us from thinking about the fact that legislative elections are also taking place, and that parliamentarians also need to have some legitimacy. They must represent their constituents, and this must be a fundamental part of the democratic process in Haiti, especially when the country is going through a crisis, as it is right now.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251873">Ever since that mission in 2006 during which I met Haitian parliamentarians, I have been concerned about the need to strengthen the parliamentary system in Haiti. Of course the Haitians themselves must be the ones to reflect and to work on this, and to do something.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251874">Personally, I am trying to do my part. I thought it might be helpful to create a friendship group, an association that might not be entirely official or recognized by the House, but an association nonetheless of Haitian and Canadian parliamentarians who wish to create ties and reflect on how the Canadian Parliament and Canadian MPs and senators can help Haiti, and how to support Haitian parliamentarians to give that institution more prominence.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251875">To that end, three colleagues—from three different political parties—and I founded such an association a few months ago: the Canada-Haiti Parliamentary Group. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the three other co-founders: the hon. members for <Affiliation DbId="128153" Type="2">Bourassa</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="128308" Type="2">Outremont</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="128090" Type="2">Edmonton East</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="40">(2140)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2251876">I hope that our association, our supporters and our policies will be able to improve the situation in Haiti substantially.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251877">I would like to speak in more detail about immigration, which I followed closely as the Bloc Québécois immigration critic.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251878">In the wake of the 2010 earthquake, the federal government announced special measures to fast-track the processing of family reunification applications. In January 2006, the <Affiliation DbId="128705" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship and Immigration</Affiliation> announced extraordinary measures for Haitians directly affected by the earthquake, including fast-tracking the processing of applications in the family reunification category.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251879">Here is a list of the measures: consular assistance and evacuation of Canadian citizens who were in Haiti when the earthquake struck; priority processing of applications in various categories—including family reunification applications from Quebec—for those directly and seriously affected by the earthquake in Haiti; evacuation of adopted Haitian children coming to Canada, which happened very quickly—it should be said that the process was already quite advanced in these cases; lifting of fees and consideration of other relevant factors related to the difficulties faced by temporary residents in Canada; lifting of visa requirements for aid workers and evacuees coming to Canada; temporary lifting of all removals to Haiti, which seems obvious to me; and information sessions that took place all over.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251880">I would like to talk about Quebec's humanitarian sponsorship program in detail. In Canada, it is the federal government's responsibility to determine who can sponsor, who can be sponsored and for which family members the guarantor is required to prove their financial capacity. Since the 1991 Canada-Quebec agreement, Quebec alone deals with the integration of immigrants within its borders.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251881">Given that family reunification is a key component in integrating immigrants into Quebec society, the Bloc Québécois feels that family reunification should be handed over to Quebec, since it is already responsible for all family-related issues. In addition, this measure would allow for more efficient processing of family reunification applications and would mean that most procedures would be concentrated within Quebec's immigration and cultural communities department, while still giving Ottawa the right to monitor security issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251882">The Government of Quebec has the expertise to do this and has demonstrated it by moving ahead with its own selection system to reunite Haitians affected by the disaster, 90% of whom live in Quebec, as I mentioned earlier.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251883">In response to an exceptional situation, the Government of Quebec decided to adopt special immigration measures. On February 3, it announced the creation of the special humanitarian sponsorship program, which was effective from February to the end of July 2010 and which temporarily helped reunite families by allowing Quebec residents to sponsor brothers, sisters and children over the age of 22.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251884">Through this initiative, Quebec welcomed 3,000 Haitians, in addition to the 1,900 sponsorship applications that were already awaiting approval from Ottawa. Furthermore, another Quebec resident, a relative or not, could act as a co-guarantor for the five-year financial commitment, to make it easier to meet the financial requirements.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251885">As of November 4, the Government of Quebec had received 8,354 applications through this measure. In addition, 2,400 Quebec selection certificates were issued. The majority of the applications from Quebec are still awaiting approval from Ottawa, which only deals with issues of health and safety.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251886">On August 30, at the last minute, the Canadian Minister of Citizenship and Immigration quietly issued a reminder that the special measures for Haiti would come to an end on September 1, practically the following day. After the announcement of the end of the so-called special measures, an operational bulletin was published to give instructions regarding the processing of applications for Haitian nationals. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251887">What does all of this mean? The new timeframe to complete the eligibility assessments for sponsorship applications will be 40 days as opposed to 10 days.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="45">(2145)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2251888">Applications that were to be processed as a priority within a 12-week deadline will now be processed as quickly as possible. We do not really know what that means in terms of a deadline. Fees will be charged again. What is more, if I can make an editorial comment, it is particularly questionable to try to resolve our deficit problems with permanent residency applications from Haiti.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251889">Haitian citizens in Canada applying for a work visa will now have to get a valid labour market opinion and pay the applicable fees. I will come back to that because I think it is very important. Eligibility for the interim federal health plan no longer applies to the new applications. CIC's priorities will change.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251890">Although the department says it is very open to Quebec's right to have its own program that, among other things, broadens the definition of family reunification beyond immediate family, and even though it recognizes that possibility, in fact the choices made by Quebec are a second priority. Only people who correspond to the traditional definition of the family class established by the federal government are entitled to be top priority. It should be noted that the expression “second priority” is a euphemism, because it is not in fact a priority.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251891">On October 6, 2010, only 18 Haitians arrived on Quebec soil under that program. Thousands of applications had been filed and 493 applications were received by CIC, which means less than 4% of these people got as far as Quebec soil on October 6. We are quite concerned about the federal government's lack of flexibility and the fact that it often deems documents not to be credible.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251892">I will try to be quick because I see that my time is running out and I have a lot to say about immigration. The Bloc Québécois is very concerned and believes that the temporary work visas should remain open-ended without any need for a labour market opinion. These opinions ensure that foreign nationals are not used as cheap labour to fill jobs that could otherwise be filled by Canadians. It is a process the Bloc Québécois generally agrees with. Nonetheless, we find it appropriate that this requirement be waived for Haitians who are already in Quebec or Canada, especially since there is currently a moratorium on sending them back to Haiti because the situation is difficult and it is almost impossible to do.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251893">We therefore find ourselves in a situation where there are people who were in Canada during the earthquake for one reason or another, who now have the right to remain in Canada for an indefinite period of time and who have been told that they can, for example, continue to work temporarily to meet their needs. These people may be driven to work in the underground economy. By requiring a labour market opinion, a fairly complex procedure that sometimes does not result in employment because the opinion is negative, we are depriving these people of a way of supporting themselves and are therefore pushing them toward working in the underground economy or pushing them into difficulty meeting their needs. It is completely counterproductive.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251894">I hope that the government will quickly remedy this situation and allow the people who cannot be sent back to Haiti as things stand to work to meet their needs.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251895">In conclusion, although a lot of work has been done by citizens and the federal government, there is still much more to be done. It has always been said that the Haitians are a very resilient people.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="50">(2150)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2251896">They have suffered a lot and we must provide them with support. I am convinced that they have the desire to overcome this situation. They are very resilient. There are promising areas everywhere in Haiti. We spoke earlier in the House about Jacmel, a location that I had the opportunity to visit and that represents great potential for us. It is up to us to develop it.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I am not yet an expert, but I have been following this issue closely for over two years as critic for the Bloc Québécois. His question gives me another opportunity to speak.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251900">There seems to be an inconsistency in the government's position on temporary work visas. If they say that an individual cannot be deported because the situation in his country is untenable, which the Bloc agrees with, then we must give him the means to work during this temporary period—which is indeterminate for the time being—that he is in Canada.

I do not want to impugn the government's motives, but we get the feeling that that is what is behind the government's actions. The government, which abruptly cancelled this support measure, is telling itself that if people stay and work under the table, they will not be able to claim permanent residence later because they will not be able to prove they qualify in the Canadian experience class.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251902">If that were so, it would be slightly convoluted and deplorable reasoning. These people need our support, and we have to keep on helping them. In all cases, the federal government could have been more flexible and granted temporary resident permits to people who just wanted to come and see their family in Montreal or elsewhere in order to catch their breath, have a change of scenery and distance themselves from the earthquake in Haiti. They had no intention of living here and going through winter in Quebec. The government showed no flexibility with regard to these people. That is something else we condemn.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

As I am very familiar with the file, I perhaps did not express myself well and I took shortcuts. I will explain again, from the beginning.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251906">When the Haiti earthquake occurred, Haitian nationals may have been working or studying in Canada. They were living temporarily in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251907">Take the example of someone working on a temporary visa. The government said that, upon the expiry of the temporary work visa, the individual could renew it or apply for a new one if they had completed their studies, for example, in order to be allowed to work in Canada and have an income. That was the government's reasoning and it was completely logical. We are not talking about an inordinate number of applicants; we are simply talking about the Haitians who were temporarily in Canada. We could not send them back to Haiti. We are simply asking why this measure was not extended. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251908">Some of them may be able to obtain a labour market opinion, but others may not. For example, for jobs requiring fewer qualifications, it is obviously more difficult to prove that an individual is the only one qualified for the job and that there is a shortage of labour in Canada in that area.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251909">I understand that we cannot invent jobs. That is not what I am suggesting. If a Haitian national is currently living here and cannot be deported or returned to that country because of a moratorium, he should be allowed to find a job. That will not affect the job market. The purpose of the labour market opinion is to prevent massive waves of temporary workers from destabilizing the job market and depriving Quebeckers and Canadians of jobs. We understand this measure, but it is not justified or necessary for the few workers that might be affected. I do not have the figure at hand, but I am sufficiently versed in this matter to know that the number of Haitians would not destabilize the job market. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251910">The government understood this because it took that step, but then terminated it. The government was on the right track and should have maintained this measure, just as it is maintaining the moratorium on deportations to Haiti. When the situation is deemed to be stable enough to lift the moratorium on deportations, then we can also rescind the special measures allowing those persons, who are prisoners of sorts in Canada, to be employed. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

There seems to be a gap between what the government says in public and what it actually does. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251915">The day after tomorrow, the members of the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration will be meeting with senior officials from Citizenship and Immigration Canada for further clarification. I realize they are dealing with some major challenges and that they are very dedicated and very competent, but I think that, in terms of policy, the government could give clearer directions and allow those officials greater latitude.

Throughout this crisis, since this horrendous event on January 12, he has been there for our colleagues and friends in the Haitian community in Montreal and Haiti, just as he always will be. His has been a very strong voice during this crisis, and he has always been present. It is thanks to him that we can have this debate this evening. It is important that we show our friendship for the Haitian people, and all the parties have done that this evening.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251952">Our Haitian friends have gone through a few extremely difficult years. Their country was devastated by natural disasters, from deforestation to systemic poverty to the four back-to-back hurricanes in 2008 that caused enormous damage. Just when the country was starting to rebuild and get back on its feet again, the earthquake hit on January 12, causing over 250,000 deaths and making more than 1.5 million people homeless. They were literally in the street because they did not want to go back into their homes, which were still standing, for fear they would collapse on them.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251953">Now, nearly 12 months later, cholera is ravaging the Haitian population. More than 2,000 people have died, and tens of thousands are at risk. On top of all that, Haiti is in the midst of a human and political crisis. The elections that were just held were rife with irregularities. Two candidates made it through the first round of voting to the run-off, which sparked a wave of violence throughout the country. Haitians do not believe or trust these results. They want a recount. They want to know that their votes will count, but they are not confident they will. With all the violence and instability in the country, the humanitarian aid so many Haitians depended on has almost stopped flowing, which is obviously making things even worse. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251954">This country is experiencing catastrophes of near biblical proportions on many fronts, such as weakened infrastructure, epidemics, malnutrition, violence and anarchy as a result of a lack of respect for police forces. However, in my opinion, the greatest catastrophe is the total loss of the sense of community, of that essential trust that exists and must exist between a people and its leaders. That trust forms the foundation of the social contract. The people of Haiti do not believe that their government can offer them services and that it is there to help and serve them. When we talk of governance, we know that Haitians are worried about the elections that are currently underway. They cannot trust that their vote was properly counted or that the will of the people was represented by this vote. But governance problems go deeper than that. Haitians have lost all hope that their government will be there for them, that it will provide the safety and prosperity that any community should be able to expect from its leaders.</ParaText>

Since I was elected two years ago, but even before that when I was a candidate, I have had the great pleasure of spending time with and befriending a number of members of that community. I have discovered even more than what I already knew, that Haitians are a passionate, proud people who are full of hope and full of life. They are a people who are interested in politics and in the future of their community and their society.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="20">(2220)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2251956">The people of Haiti have lost all confidence in their government's ability to provide services or even offer minimal stability. Tonight we are talking about Canada's role. We are very proud of our country, one that has always intervened with military might, whether during the first world war or the second. Our diplomacy has had an impact on the United Nations. And then there are the positions we took during the cold war and in support of nuclear disarmament. Canada has provided development aid around the world. It has always been there to spread justice and create more opportunities in the poorest countries of the world. Canada has always been there, supplying solutions to the world.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251957">And that is why we are so proud of our country. Haiti has always been a good friend to Canada and vice versa. Because of our diaspora and our friendships, we have suffered with them throughout these difficult years. It is our duty to be there during these difficult times, and we must respond to their needs.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251958">This evening we have spoken a lot about the desperate, essential and immediate needs. We have to be present during the elections and help find solutions to restore the public's confidence in its democratic institutions. The public needs a president who reflects the will of the country. It is important that the exemplary generosity that Canadians have shown in the months following the earthquake be validated by spending the money we promised them and targeting aid adequately.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251959">There are many things we can do with regard to agriculture to rebuild the foundation of this country. There are things we must do with regard to civil society and the status of women.

He has become a major expert on the situation in Haiti and, for that reason and many others, he is greatly respected and admired by Haitians, not only here in Canada but also in Haiti.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251975">I would also like to recognize the work that the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128110" Type="2">Papineau</Affiliation> has done for the Haitian community in Montreal. The hon. member for Papineau, the hon. member for Bourassa and I have many people from Haiti in our ridings. These are people of whom we are very fond. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251976">I must say that I am somewhat familiar with Haiti having been there several times since 1994. It is a country for which I have a great deal of love and respect.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251977">This emergency debate is completely necessary given the current situation in Haiti. We must gain a better understanding of and better define what is happening in Haiti. We must assess what the international community and Canada are doing on the ground, but we must also work together to determine areas in which we can improve.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251978">What more can we do for Haiti, a country that has suffered so much and with which we have a very personal and even fraternal relationship?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251979">Haiti has experienced difficulties throughout its history, and this year has been particularly cruel. It started with a devastating earthquake that ravaged the capital of Port-au-Prince and killed more than 250,000 men, women and children. The fallout was felt across the country. Add to that hundreds of thousands of injured and 1.5 million people who were displaced and left homeless. How many children were orphaned? We will probably never know the exact figure, but it is unimaginable. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251980">The entire country was affected: its people, its infrastructure and even its political and organizational structure. The economic, political and human repercussions and consequences of this terrible tragedy are still frightfully evident today. I am thinking, for example, of the many displaced and homeless people who still do not have a permanent roof over their heads and who live in makeshift camps, not to mention the countless number of people and families who have been left with no income. </ParaText><ParaText id="2251981">And now, more recently, there has been a public health catastrophe. I am obviously talking about the cholera epidemic that is sweeping the country. This epidemic has already killed more than 2,200 people and is endangering the lives of thousands of Haitians. On a more personal note, I can say that I have seen the effects of cholera in other parts of the world and they are absolutely devastating.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251982">To top it all off, there is now a political crisis. We know that the country finds itself in a difficult situation and is in the throes of a major crisis because of the November elections, which were rife with irregularities. When the results of the first round of voting and the names of the two candidates who made it to the January 2011 run-off were announced, it sparked a wave of violence that has not subsided. Haitians do not believe that the election results reflect the ballots cast, their choice and their will.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251983">This is ample justification for the emergency debate we are holding. It is urgent that we reflect, it is urgent that we understand, but even more importantly, it is urgent that we take action. It is clear that, if Canada, as well as the entire international community, does not immediately address this crisis, the Haitian people will face catastrophe on several fronts: epidemics, malnutrition, violence, and civil and political instability. We must work on all these fronts at the same time.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251984">First of all, as we have said in the past and are saying again, it is imperative that the Canadian government immediately appoint a special envoy who will have both a political and diplomatic role among the local and international authorities in Haiti.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="35">(2235)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2251985">The hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128153" Type="2">Bourassa</Affiliation> has repeatedly expressed this hope, but we are still waiting.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251986">More specifically, politically speaking, we need to work on fixing the democratic process as quickly as possible. Indeed, urgent action is needed.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251987">We must also focus our efforts on other key stakeholders, in order to garner their support for a peaceful resolution to this crisis. In other words, we need to shake things up. We need to show leadership and urge our allies to get moving if we want our Haitian friends to progress peacefully.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251988">There are many ways to resolve this crisis. That being said, whatever we do, we must respect the system in place as well as Haitian laws, from both a judicial and electoral standpoint.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251989">We are all here this evening to figure out how we can help the electoral process in Haiti, and not to take the place of that country's decision makers.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251990">We must look at how we can work together, but we must not try to take anyone's place. What is crucial in the long term is ensuring that this never happens again. We must work with the Haitian people, with institutions and other partners to ensure that the next time Haitians go to the polls, there will be appropriate monitoring and security measures in place to make the whole process transparent. We want to make sure the new president has a credible mandate and the legitimacy needed to govern. In other words, we need to learn from all of this in order to make sure it never happens again.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251991">Regarding health, I also believe that CIDA needs to send an assessment team immediately to work directly on the ground, to talk to the people, to doctors and other authorities, in order to maximize the effectiveness of the aid being sent to stop the cholera epidemic.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251992">There is one other important point. Some people have already pointed this out, and it bears repeating: we must absolutely ensure that the money makes it to organizations on the ground. That is absolutely essential. Canada has promised large sums of money to help Haiti, but so far it has allocated only part of that money. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been promised, but the money has not yet been allocated. This also needs to be corrected immediately. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251993">Members may recall that the government made a number of announcements and promised hundreds of millions of dollar in aid. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the ministers responsible for CIDA spoke about funds “distributed“—the terms are important here—and funds “promised”, but unfortunately, that is very different from the funds that have actually been delivered. It takes more than promises; it takes money on the ground. This confusion makes no sense when you see the generosity extended to Haiti by Canadians from across the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251994">Lack of transparency is another serious problem. There has been some cloud or shadow, and we need to know a bit more in terms of how funds have been distributed. It is nearly impossible to find relevant information about Canada's priorities, planned expenditures or commitments in Haiti. Like everything else, this must be corrected.</ParaText><ParaText id="2251995">As I said earlier, we have historic ties with Haiti. We are more than partners, we are friends—good friends, even—because we share common values and a language and we work together in institutions such as la Francophonie and others. And then there are the tens of thousands of Canadians of Haitian origin who are here. These people are an extraordinary addition to our society. Today they are part of Canada's social fabric.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2251996">To conclude, I would like to say that I have had the opportunity to visit Haiti a number of times, and I know the strength, courage and determination of the Haitian people. These people have always been able to rise up and today they will rise once again. It is our duty to be there with them.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

As he said, there is a crisis of confidence. In a way, the international community has to prove itself much like the Haitian institutions that are in place. Haiti has survived too many crises and has had too many problems related to democracy and the electoral process. This type of mistrust is therefore normal. We must show that we are there not to act as a substitute for anyone but to work hand in hand with Haitian partners and institutions.</ParaText><ParaText id="2252008">I think that the example set by the NGOs is excellent. I had the opportunity to go to Haiti for the first time in 1994. I worked in international development for almost 10 years. I would say that the advantage that the NGOs have is their close relationship with the Haitian social activists, public and leaders, which allows them to develop a bond of trust. We can make big promises and contribute as much money as we want but it will not be enough without a relationship of trust.

I also thank other speakers tonight for their very insightful observations about the situation in Haiti. A number of them have been on the ground in Haiti and have had experience in that country. I have been to many countries over the years and some in that region but not in Haiti itself. Therefore, I cannot give an on the ground report as to how I saw the situation.</ParaText><ParaText id="2252010">However, the country is a very poor country and has been for many years. When a country that does not have good resources and good infrastructure to begin with and then visit upon it a devastating earthquake, such as the one we saw last year, and, on top of that, the whole issue of political instability and the cholera outbreak, it is a recipe for a worsening disaster than what it currently has in its hands.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2252011">We have seen governments in the past respond to international tragedies that have occurred and all goes well for a little while when the issue is in the news and then it disappears from the news and we go on to another issue and the countries are left to fend for themselves. In this case, a lot of good has happened so far this year with Canadians responding in larger numbers than we have seen in many years and the government adding the matching funds idea, which I gather was not necessarily its idea. I think it has been tried before but it was a very well timed offer and as a result the government has indicated it has raised about $400 million through that effort, which is very positive. Now the issue is how it should be allocated or spent.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2252012">I believe the member for <Affiliation DbId="128279" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation> said that we do not want to be quick about allocating the funds because we want to ensure we get full value for our dollar. One of the reasons we are having a harder time raising donations from the public in all sorts of different charitable efforts is that the public in some ways has questions about how the money is being spent. People would like to have some feedback on how their money is spent. This could be a very good test case. The government and the minister should take it upon themselves to issue a report on how things are going with the donations that people have made. If people who contributed $100 or $200 to aid were to get some feedback on precisely what happened to their money, I think they would be much more willing to contribute once again the next year. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2252013">Given the magnitude of the problem and the fact that the situation in Haiti is getting worse, the proper approach would be for the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to use his offices and his various channels to get world leaders to look at Haiti in the same way that the free world dealt with Europe and Japan after the Second World War. Every member in this chamber knows how much destruction there was in Europe and in Japan during the Second World War and yet, miracle of miracles, after the war we saw a full recovery in Europe and a recovery in Japan to the point where they became world powers in short order. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="50">(2250)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2252014">The question is, how did that come about? That came about with a concerted plan and, of course, a lot of money. The reconstruction of those devastated areas was done very successfully. Why do we not have the ability in this country collectively to replicate in a small way that experience?</ParaText><ParaText id="2252015"> In China there was an earthquake last year. I saw a CBC report, which I mentioned to the minister earlier today, where a Chinese official was giving a glowing report about Canada's participation in the reconstruction in China. The Chinese have a plan. Their plan is to reconstruct the buildings that I guess were built of brick and steel which were susceptible to collapse in earthquake conditions. The brick and steel are being replaced with Canadian lumber. To me that is a win-win situation. It will help us deal with our lumber issues. More important, on a long-term basis it will help the Chinese rebuild the cities that were devastated by the earthquake. When another earthquake comes about in the future, as it will, we will not be repeating the mistakes of the past.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2252016">A Conservative member talked about a church group that he is familiar with that has developed a new type of housing that they are looking at for the Haiti situation. I forget how he described the housing, but it certainly makes sense to me that it would be earthquake resistant and hurricane resistant. That is another liability the islands have in the Caribbean. For whatever it is costing them to put this housing together, that is a plus. To me, if it takes a few extra months to get it right and if we can rebuild in a smart way using best practices, then we are going to do well in the future.</ParaText><ParaText id="2252017"> Habitat for Humanity is very active. Former President Carter is involved in this. He has been involved in Habitat for Humanity in Winnipeg, rebuilding. I read all of the backgrounder information on the Haitian earthquake and it seems that almost every organization in the world is there. All of this is good because they can offer their expertise. </ParaText><ParaText id="2252018">The question is, is anyone coordinating their efforts? Is there an overall plan? I am sure there is, it is just that I am not familiar with what overall plan would be. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2252019">The point is that we have to not only harness all those resources to get the job done and get it done right, but when stories come back to us out of the country about money that is stolen and misspent and construction that is done in a poor fashion, that is negative to our efforts for the future, because what happens is we lose support for the efforts we are trying to develop, in this case in Haiti.</ParaText><ParaText id="2252020">I know my colleagues mentioned earlier, because I read <I>Hansard</I>, that no solution is going to work without getting the Haitians involved. I do agree that we cannot force a solution on them, and now they are in a political upheaval.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="55">(2255)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2252021">We cannot let the situation deteriorate to the point where there is anarchy in the country. If we follow this through and there is a breakdown of authority in the country, then it will have to resort to a military situation. I do not think we want to go there. We are not headed on the right track. Why are we having this problem? My guess is that people are waiting for results. </ParaText><ParaText id="2252022">I have seen some news reports that indicate people are still living in conditions similar to those in refugee camps. Perhaps they may be safer than they would be in their houses if there were to be aftershocks or another earthquake. However, it cannot be a healthy situation for people to live there on a long-term basis.</ParaText><ParaText id="2252023">The member who made the request for an emergency debate tonight was absolutely correct in his assessment of what needs to be done. It is important that we involve ourselves in the debate this evening. The question is what the final resolution will be out of the debate. If we simply have a debate and nothing happens afterward, then we have not really solved the problem.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2252024">I would have preferred to hear more concrete suggestions as to what should be done in this situation. It would have been good to have some sort of plan put forward by the Liberal Party, as a Liberal member made the request for the emergency debate. Maybe some option should have been given to the government as to where we should go from here.</ParaText><ParaText id="2252025">Has the matching funds program run its course? I am not sure. I asked the member for the statistics and he gave them to me as best he could, but I do not know if the matching funds are still coming in or whether the program is finished. People are not thinking about it any more and have ceased donating. </ParaText><ParaText id="2252026">What will be the status of the matching funds next year? Even though the situation might be as bad or even worse next year, are we looking at essentially no matching funds? As far as the people of Canada are concerned, it is already a past issue. It is a year old. They have given their $100 or $200 and have got their tax receipts. They have done their bit.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2252027">Where are the people in Haiti going to be one year down the road? Where are they going to be two years down the road? Are we simply perpetuating a situation that has existed for a long time and providing a band-aid solution? I have not heard any solutions yet from members of the opposition or the government. It has been more of an information gathering exercise to get an update as to where things are.</ParaText><ParaText id="2252028">I want to indicate concern for the cholera outbreak. I am always interested when my hon. colleague from the Liberal Party participates in debates. I cannot remember her riding. She sponsored a debate recently on multiple sclerosis. She makes excellent speeches. I know she has been concerned about this issue as well</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="00">(2300)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2252029">With the cholera outbreak on top of all the other problems in the country right now, this is not a very good situation. We have to get on top of that. The construction can wait a bit, but the cholera outbreak should be job one at this point. It has to be dealt with on a priority basis. Perhaps that is where the emphasis should be, that we deal with the cholera outbreak. We try to deal with the political instability there and get through that. Regarding the long term, I believe the minister is meeting with Hillary Clinton as we speak in Quebec and perhaps they will be addressing this issue. Perhaps they should be looking at a longer term solution in terms of major reconstruction.</ParaText><ParaText id="2252030">We have to recognize that the world has been hit with a huge recession in the last couple of years. There are economies in Europe, such as Iceland, declaring bankruptcy. Ireland is in bad shape, as are Portugal, Greece and Spain. The United States is not in very healthy condition either. It might be a tough sell to be pushing a new version of the Marshall plan on these leaders at this point.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2252031">In the case of the Great Depression, members will know that the world economy languished in recession and depression for 10 years until a war started. All of a sudden there was a war and we were out of recession because we were building armaments and out shooting one another again. Maybe what is needed is a war, but a new type of war, a war on poverty. We could certainly start with Haiti's situation and put resources into Haiti to redevelop the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="2252032">It brings me to another point. I have been in Mexico and Cuba many times over the years, and I can say that constructing buildings in Mexico or Cuba is not the same as building them in Winnipeg or Ottawa. In Winnipeg or Ottawa, buildings need a lot of insulation because of the very cold weather. In countries like Cuba and Haiti, they do not have that problem of having to build the buildings to deal with cold temperatures. My guess is that the construction costs on a per unit basis are very low when we are dealing with countries like those.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2252033">I think the minister is nodding but my eyesight is not what it used to be, so I cannot tell for sure whether he is nodding in agreement, but the costs are just not there in the same way they are in the northern climates. I do not know what the cost is for putting up mass units in these countries, especially when the profit motive is taken out of it. China has certainly been active, for example, in Cuba. The Chinese, in the last few years, brought brand new fridges into Cuba and basically delivered them to people's houses by the thousands. It was part of China's foreign aid program.</ParaText><ParaText id="2252034">When we look at it on a non-profit basis, we look at where it is, we look at mass production, it seems to me that we should be getting a lot better value for our dollar than we apparently have been getting in the past.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

There is no other program that the Government of Canada has for matching funds. However, for the member's information, he can always donate to the Canadian NGOs working in Haiti and ask Canadians to donate to them for the excellent effort they are doing. The matching fund program is over.</ParaText><ParaText id="2252037">Secondly, I think there needs to be some clarification on the money that has been pledged and the international effort that is there. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, the minister for CIDA and the American Secretary of State have said that this money needs to go through the reconstruction commission. In turn, it works with the Government of Haiti to identify the projects on the ground.</ParaText><ParaText id="2252038"> I do understand the frustration of everyone, and our frustration, that the process has slowed down due to the elections.

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Cotler" id="3672694"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128189" Type="2">Hon. Irwin Cotler (Mount Royal, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2252062">Mr. Speaker, it is regrettable that the situation in Haiti surfaces, or resurfaces, and touches the Canadian conscience only when there is a situation of crisis.</ParaText><ParaText id="2252063">In that regard I want to commend my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128153" Type="2">Bourassa</Affiliation>, for his constancy and commitment over the years. He has not just spoken at a time of clear and compelling crisis, but he has been there through the years, sounding the alarm, alerting us to what is happening in Haiti, calling upon us to mobilize our resources and the conscience of the international community in that regard.</ParaText><ParaText id="2252064">Even before the earthquake that devastated Haiti, the cholera epidemic and the turbulent elections in its wake, Haiti was not only the poorest country in the western hemisphere by a significant margin, it was one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world.</ParaText><ParaText id="2252065"> Moreover Haiti, in recent years, has struggled with problems, whether they be ongoing political upheavals, health crises, severe environmental degradation, or an annual barrage of hurricanes that wiped out most of the country's food crops, destroying its irrigation system and causing acute hunger for millions, even before the devastation of the earthquake.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2252066">The deforestation and over-farming left much of Haiti eroded and barren, undermining its citizens' farming efforts, driving up food prices and leaving the country even more vulnerable to natural disasters, let alone the earthquake, again, in its wake. Its long history of political instability and corruption only added to the turmoil.</ParaText><ParaText id="2252067">Accordingly, and this must always be appreciated, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128153" Type="2">Bourassa</Affiliation> was warning us about all of these matters, before the earthquake, before the cholera epidemic, before the turbulence in the political culture. He warned us that Haiti faced significant developmental challenges that we ought to have been addressing all these years.</ParaText><ParaText id="2252068">Even before the earthquake, et cetera, fewer than 30% of Haitians had access to electricity, with roughly half of the users tapping into the national grid illegally. There were longstanding problems with garbage and solid waste removal. Clogged canals presented serious and recurring risks of flooding. In a word, it is a hard to separate what is due to the poverty and hunger levels that predated the earthquake, and what is due to the earthquake and the cholera epidemic, which followed in its wake.</ParaText><ParaText id="2252069">Approximately 80% of the people in this country lived on less than $2 a day even before the earthquake. It was that abject poverty, that hunger, that desolation that we had not been properly addressing and redressing before all of the recent calamities that have occurred and brought us to this emergency debate this evening.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2252070">Accordingly, the enormous difficulties that have confronted Haiti for decades have only been compounded by the devastation of the earthquake, the cholera outbreak and the turbulence of the election, which have added a sense of urgency to the critical issues that were there before but which taken together have the potential to derail efforts to rebuild the country and to address and alleviate the human suffering.</ParaText><ParaText id="2252071">We are now in a serious crisis, and if we do not act immediately this crisis can begin to spiral out of control in many sectors and on many levels.</ParaText><ParaText id="2252072">In summary, there are some 11 critical challenges that confront the international community in trying to suggest a framework for action for the rebuilding of the country, one that will help provide us an identification of the priorities so that we can move forward in concert with the resilience of the Haitian people.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="20">(2320)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2252073">The Haitians are a resilient and courageous people who have, regrettably, been plagued by terrible leadership, natural disasters and all that we have heard this evening, but a resilient people who, given the opportunity, can address and redress the human suffering that has befallen and besets them.</ParaText><ParaText id="2252074">I will now go through some of these critical challenges at this point. First, one needs to establish a comprehensive rebuilding strategy and a set of priorities. While the Haitian government's action plan for a national recovery and development represented a good start, frankly, Haitians need, are waiting for and are asking for concrete guidance on everything from where displaced persons can resettle, to how the educational system will be rebuilt, to what the nature is of economic decentralization and private sector investment. Fundamentally, they want to know how they will be able to earn a living, how they will send their children to school, how they will be able to access health services and how they will deal with the daily emergencies that are besetting them as we meet.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2252075">Second, this also means building leadership and capacity in the government of Haiti. However, as I say this, we need to appreciate, as is well known and mentioned this evening, that the government of Haiti was decimated by the earthquake. It has lost civil servants, senior leaders and most of the ministry buildings. In other words, having lost so much of its own personnel in the earthquake, the government of Haiti finds itself with a limited capacity. </ParaText><ParaText id="2252076">However, Haitians need to be reassured that their government can begin the rebuilding process in a cohesive fashion and executive a well thought out plan, underpinned by the presence of the international community, by the presence of the Canadian government in concert with other governments and the international community and with the local and international NGOs, some 10,000 of whom are there right now doing humanitarian work, helping out in matters of health, shelter building and the like.</ParaText><ParaText id="2252077">Third, we need to empower the Haitian recovery commission. Simply put, the commission does represent an opportunity to change the way one can do business in Haiti. One can establish an expert teams-based approach that helps build a political consensus, but it will not be able to do it alone and will require the resources that have been referenced this evening by my colleagues, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128151" Type="2">Honoré-Mercier</Affiliation>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128153" Type="2">Bourassa</Affiliation> and the like.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2252078">Fourth, we need to address the resettlement issue. The hundreds of thousands of Haitians trapped in temporary or informal settlements is a major recovery issue. We need to offer solutions for moving displaced people out of the dozens of tent cities that have cropped up. There is land available but land tenure issues and other complications need to be resolved. The longer Haitians continue to live in makeshift camps, the harder it will be to reintegrate them into communities and to take down the camps.</ParaText><ParaText id="2252079">Fifth, we need to build democratic governments and legitimacy. There is a crisis of confidence, of trust and of morale, as my colleagues have mentioned this evening. At this point what is so necessary is to have a legitimate and authentic democratically elected government in order to lay a strong and sustainable foundation for Haiti's future.</ParaText><ParaText id="2252080">Canada can play an important role here, an important monitoring role and an important advocacy role in ensuring that a forthcoming election can be democratically held with appropriate security, with proper training and with the identification of three person candidates, because that may be what is needed, as was referenced earlier this evening, at this point.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2252081">Sixth, donors need to speak with one voice and improve coordination. There is too much fragmentation in the donor community and too much disagreement with the necessary aid not necessarily reaching the required recipient.</ParaText><ParaText id="2252082">That leads me to my seventh point, which is that there is a need to coordinate Canadian government assistance efforts with other governments, with the network of donors, with the United Nations and with the government of Haiti's own development framework lest the overlaps, the redundancies and the dysfunction prevent the aid from reaching the desired recipients and targets. As my colleagues have put it, oversight and accountability are essential mechanisms in that regard where the Canadian government can play an important role for that purpose. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="25">(2325)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2252083">With regard to our own involvement here, we have yet to deliver with respect to the aid that has been promised. We have yet to provide the necessary transparency with regard to the aid that needs to be delivered. </ParaText><ParaText id="2252084">Close to a month ago the Liberal Party called for urgent action to confront the cholera crisis in Haiti, calling on the government to deploy emergency strategic support team to do a rapid assessment of where the disaster assistance response team, DART, should be offered, calling for the urgent delivery of aid money, calling for the appointment of a Canadian special envoy and calling for the immediate deployment of a CIDA assessment team to see how we could improve our response to the cholera epidemic.</ParaText><ParaText id="2252085">Such a team could work in close communication with the strategic support team of DART and Canada could mobilize the international community, working with other international players to support the effort here that desperately needs to be put in place, because the time is urgent and regrettably and tragically the crisis is now.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2252086">Eight, we need to rebuild Haiti's decimated civil service. The bureaucracy and civil service suffered as we know a triple blow from the earthquake. Almost all the ministry buildings were damaged or destroyed due to their proximity to the epicentre of the earthquake. Huge numbers of civil servants were themselves killed in the course of the earthquake. As of today, most ministries are operating out of makeshift offices including tents. Computer systems are not functioning, electricity is threadbare and basic supplies are hard to come by.</ParaText><ParaText id="2252087">In a word, the civil service has to be rebuilt. The delivery systems for delivering all that is needed in all the sectors to which I have referred must be rebuilt and mobilized and Canada has a role to play in this regard.</ParaText><ParaText id="2252088">Nine, we need to maintain the security gains. Right before the earthquake struck security in fact was one of the success stories in the country, with neighbourhoods such Cité Soleil having gained significant stability. Regrettably, recently, as we know, not only has security become more difficulty, not only is there an increase in gang violence, but it has now become vital that the international community join together with the Haitian government to build the capacity of the Haitian national police and the key justice sector reforms to be advanced in order to confront prison abuses, indefinite pretrial detentions and human rights abuses.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2252089">As well, continued international support for the United Nations stabilization mission in Haiti is essential, though the international community must ensure that this United Nations stabilization mission is not itself over taxed in such a way that we defer to it matters which we have to undertake ourselves in order to ensure the job gets done.</ParaText><ParaText id="2252090">Ten, we need to bring the broader Haitian community into the rebuilding process. It is crucial that Haitian civil society and those outside the governmental process participate in the reconstruction of Haiti. Rebuilding the country must not be politicized, but should be an inclusive process that attempts to build an equal and responsible and accessible society.</ParaText><ParaText id="2252091">The government of Haiti must embrace civil society and Haitian non-governmental organizations and the private sector must be part of the rebuilding process. Without a broader inclusion of Haitian stakeholders, the formation of what has sometimes been referred to, and one could speak of this much more, before the recent earthquake, the cholera epidemic, the turbulent election, one spoke then of reimagining Haiti. I am not saying that so much now of reimagining Haiti. I think we now have to speak of saving Haiti and we have to mobilize all the resources for that purpose.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="30">(2330)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2252092">Finally, health concerns must be a priority lest the lack of making health a priority undermine the rebuilding efforts to which I have been referring, thereby eroding morale, trust, credibility and effectiveness. We need urgent action to confront the cholera epidemic, just as we need urgent action to confront the cross-section of health-related problems in Haiti. </ParaText><ParaText id="2252093">Eleven months after the earthquake, Haiti is at a crossroads. It is faced with challenges in many areas: infrastructure, resettlement, job creation, education, health, environment, justice, security, and of course, democratic government and legitimacy. It must confront all these challenges with a necessarily reduced capacity because of the earthquake and the related devastation. </ParaText><ParaText id="2252094">It is essential that Canada, the United Nations and the international community, including the international donor community, improve their involvement, their coordination and their relationship with the Haitian government and people so that an underresourced Haitian government, together with a resilient Haitian people, can make the important policy decisions that need to be made, and together with that resilient, patient people, can begin to alleviate the human suffering lest the kinds of crises that I have been describing begin to bring us into the area of catastrophe.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Peter Kent (Minister of State of Foreign Affairs (Americas), CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2252095">Mr. Speaker, I would like to compliment my hon. colleague for a very thoughtful presentation, for an effective summary of the succession of man-made and natural disasters that have brutalized Haiti and Haitian society over the decades. I would also compliment my hon. colleague for his list of suggestions, suggestions that have been made in different forms by other colleagues on both sides of the House tonight and that all are worthy in their form.</ParaText><ParaText id="2252096">I would remind my colleague, though, that at the Montreal conference shortly after the earthquake it was decided and there was consensus among the international community, NGOs and the Government of Haiti that the United Nations would be the coordinating body but that all final decisions would be made by the representatives of the people of Haiti, effectively the government of Haiti. </ParaText><ParaText id="2252097">It is true that this year the succession of disasters on top of the earthquake disaster, the heavy rains, the cholera epidemic and now this election violence, each of these compounding the tragedy of the event before it, have left the Haitian people in, as the member properly described, a tragic situation, an even deeper tragedy than a year ago.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2252098">There is no shortage of money at hand, as the international community, with Canadians leading the way, has shared its charity in historic proportion, but the problem has been with the assignment of land, land title, the problems of rubble clearance, and reassignment of property for industries, any number of which are waiting in Canada to engage in housing. I wonder whether my colleague is suggesting that perhaps we should revisit the decision-making and implementation process with more forceful intervention by the international community.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
