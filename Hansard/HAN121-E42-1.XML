					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Malcolmson" id="9292174"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="214119" Type="2">Ms. Sheila Malcolmson (Nanaimo—Ladysmith, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4687422">Mr. Speaker, to honour veterans, fallen soldiers, and peacekeepers who stood up for Canada, we gather on Remembrance Day to honour the service of the men and women who put their lives on the line for our country.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687423"> Nanaimo—Ladysmith's Legions, No. 256 Mt. Benson, and No. 10 Harewood, in Nanaimo; No. 257 Lantzville; No. 171 Ladysmith; the Gabriola Island Veterans Association; and Cedar Valley Memorial Gardens, all held powerful services to recognize Remembrance Day in Nanaimo—Ladysmith. I am grateful for their work. They are keeping veterans' stories alive, and we are grateful to them.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687424">Veterans need parliamentarians to do our part to recognize and support those who have sacrificed for our country. There is clearly a debt owed, there is money in the till, and sincere and vital promises have been made. Every year, 3,000 veterans pass away, so let us get on with it and act to show that we truly support veterans.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687425">There are eight things that parliamentarians can do to live up to that responsibility. Last year, this House unanimously passed a motion brought forward by my colleague, the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="214460" Type="2">Port Moody—Coquitlam</Affiliation>, recognizing Canada's covenant of moral, social, legal, and financial obligations to veterans. </ParaText><ParaText id="4687426">Here are the eight ways that we could act on that unanimous commitment of this House:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687427">One, instead of spending thousands of dollars fighting veterans in court, the Liberal government should halt the court proceedings against wounded veterans and spend that money instead to bring back veterans' pensions.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687428">Second, because one in six vets experiences mental health or alcohol-related disorders, or have in this past year, and because half who have served in Afghanistan have suffered PTSD, depression, and anxiety, I call upon this Parliament to prioritize and support the mental health of military service men and women, veterans, first responders, retired and volunteer first responders, and their families.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687429">Third, to make real change for vets and their families, we can defeat paternalistic legislation that blocks pension benefits for two groups: one, spouses of veterans, RCMP members, judges, and public sector workers who choose to marry after the age of 60; and, second, retired and disabled Canadian Forces and RCMP veterans.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687430"> The fix for this bill and the mental health one referred to previously are Bills <Document DbId="8172639" Type="4">C-260</Document>, <Document DbId="8176662" Type="4">C-261</Document>, and Motion No. 61, all from the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="214344" Type="2">London—Fanshawe</Affiliation> and the New Democrat critic for Veterans Affairs.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687431">Fourth, to our shame, homelessness rates in Canada are shocking, with estimates that there might be as many as 1,300 veterans living on Canada's streets. Canada's national housing strategy must take action on veteran homelessness.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687432">Fifth, the government should act on detox treatments for veterans exposed to chemical defoliants like Agent Orange. Medical treatment can cut dioxin levels such that veterans can return to work. It will not repair the damage, but it can help people function.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687433">Six, we should relax the regulations on access to veterans hospitals, and ensure that veterans from World War II and the Korean War are able to access these beds when they require long-term care.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687434">Seven, and I am very glad to say that this has already been done, the government will start covering the cost of medically prescribed cannabis extract products for police and military veterans being treated for PTSD. This was the subject of a petition that I sponsored, and I am very glad that the government listened to the many Canadians who supported this change.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687435">Eighth, we can pass this bill to make Remembrance Day a holiday. Earlier versions of this bill to make Remembrance Day a holiday across the country were introduced by former New Democrat MPs Dan Harris, Chris Charlton, Nelson Riis, and veterans' advocate Peter Stoffer.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687436">In my home province of British Columbia, November 11 is already a holiday. As a result, we see families coming together to recognize and celebrate Remembrance Day. When families remember together, they are able to teach their children about the sacrifices that the men and women who have fought and continue to fight for Canada have made.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687437">For example, Ladysmith's Legion hosts an afternoon ceremony in the community of Cedar, at the Cedar Valley Memorial Gardens, where there are cadets, Guides, Scouts,  and Beavers. It is lovely to see, and a great example of what happens when families honour and celebrate together.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687438">Last month, on Remembrance Day, we recommitted to standing up for veterans and their families, so that every veteran has the care that our country owes them. Bureaucratic delays and disingenuous platitudes cannot define Canada's response to veterans, and just 2.5 of 23 Liberal promises have been fully implemented. Let us use our power as leaders and voters and support real change for veterans and their families. </ParaText><ParaText id="4687439">On Remembrance Day and all days, we never forget; we forever honour.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

This bill would make Remembrance Day a legal holiday.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687441">November has passed, and all of our communities have commemorated another November 11. I know how very proud all members of the House are of our veterans and serving military personnel. I know that we are just as proud of our students who are learning about the events of World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the war in Afghanistan. Some of them are learning for the first time about all the sacrifices made and the lives lost and disrupted here at home in our communities and our country.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687442">I believe that November 11, the day we commemorate these tragic events every year, deserves the same legal status and the same recognition by Parliament as Canada Day and Victoria Day. That is why I am proud to be here to support my hon. colleague's bill.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4687443">This year, I was particularly pleased to attend something that happens every year in the only English school in my riding. It was an incredibly happy event, where students were proud to get up and deliver their interpretation of the events we commemorate every year. They were proud to be part of underlining and underscoring our history, proud to learn of the stories of the many Canadians who gave themselves to the defence of our values, our freedoms, our liberties, and proud to look at the military members who are serving today.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687444">There was everyone from CF-18 pilots to bylaw officers, all of those who wake up every day and put on a uniform and defend the laws of Canada, the freedoms of Canada, and the values of Canada and Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687445">When my colleague asked me if I were able and disposed to support his private member's bill, I was particularly pleased to think of the many people in <Affiliation DbId="213954" Type="2">Gatineau</Affiliation>, and the many people I know who reside in his riding and all over this country, who want to stand up every day and recognize the tragic events that we underscore and underline every year.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4687446">I was so proud to learn that the government is also going to support the key principle of this bill and give Remembrance Day legal status. It is important to emphasize that this does not in any way force the provinces or municipalities to do the same. It is a symbolic gesture, but a very powerful one, given that Parliament is giving Remembrance Day the same legal status as Canada Day and Victoria Day, in May.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687447">I will not dwell on this any further. I hope my colleagues on all sides of the House will support my hon. colleague's bill, and I urge everyone to do so. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687448">I would invite all Canadians to continue to make every effort to mark Remembrance Day with pride every year, as my constituents in Gatineau always do. I hope we can move quickly to pass this bill. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Berthold" id="9292189"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="214171" Type="2">Mr. Luc Berthold (Mégantic—L'Érable, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4687449">Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his speech.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687450">Indeed, if there is one thing that everyone in the House can agree on, it is the importance of recognizing the contribution of our veterans, the men and women who have fought for our country over the years. I am especially proud to rise today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="8443206" Type="4">C-311</Document> sponsored by our colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214518" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687451">I would also like to commend the work of my colleague, the official opposition critic for veterans affairs, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214534" Type="2">Barrie—Innisfil</Affiliation>. He is doing a fantastic job as our veterans affairs critic and on top of that his French is excellent. He spent the weekend in Quebec City speaking with members of associations and other people in the region, all in French. His hard work and his efforts to use both of Canada's official languages deserve recognition. I thank him for that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687452"> Bill <Document DbId="8443206" Type="4">C-311</Document> before us today is quite interesting and has quite a background. This is the seventh time this bill has been introduced in the House since 2004. This is therefore not the first time members of the House have the opportunity to speak to such a bill. Although interesting, some aspects of it need some improvement, or at least some clarification. That is more or less what I will be talking about today.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687453">First, as I said at the outset, it is important to acknowledge the service of our veterans. Since Confederation, more than 110,000 Canadian soldiers have died in combat defending our freedoms. Canada is the free country we are so proud of today because of the sacrifices of these soldiers and their families, whose children were lost in battle to defend us on foreign soil. They fought abroad for Canada's freedom and the modern world we live in today.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687454">The purpose of Bill <Document DbId="8443206" Type="4">C-311</Document> is to make Remembrance Day a legal holiday and everything that entails. We absolutely must discuss this bill further in committee. Although this bill seeks to honour veterans, it does not have unanimous support as it is currently worded. In fact, the Royal Canadian Legion has concerns over the effects of this bill on the significance we place on Remembrance Day, and that is what I will be talking about. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687455">We celebrate Remembrance Day on November 11 for a very simple reason. Historically, people have gathered together every year on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month to mark Remembrance Day and pay tribute to all those who died while serving their country. This important day gives meaning to and allows us to express our gratitude for the sacrifices that were made by those who came before us.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687456">However, not everyone has a day off for Remembrance Day. This day of commemoration is a holiday in some provinces but not in others. That is the case in Quebec, where Remembrance Day is not a statutory holiday for all workers. As a result, most of the time, Remembrance Day is not celebrated on November 11 but rather on the weekend before or after, so that more people can attend the commemoration ceremonies at the cenotaphs. They voluntarily attend these ceremonies and commemorate the service of our veterans.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4687457"> The Royal Canadian Legion is the reason we have ceremonies in every region, even those without military bases. I would like to tell the House about the Legion. It was founded in 1926 when 15 veterans' organizations united. There were also a number of regimental associations representing former service members.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687458">Despite all their efforts, none of them had much influence individually. They did not have the means to become an association that represented all veterans. That is why the Royal Canadian Legion was founded in 1926. I encourage anyone who wants to know more about the Legion to visit the organization's website, which is nicely set up and does a great job explaining its history. According to the website, initially, the principal objectives of the Legion were to provide a strong voice for veterans and advise the government on veterans' issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687459">The Legion was founded after World War I, and it was very busy after World War II because of an influx of new demands. That war was a very hard one, and the Legion had to increase its efforts to help veterans and returned service members in addition to those who continued to serve their country abroad.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687460">The Legion has changed a lot since then. We have the Legion to thank for a few special initiatives, including the two-minute wave of silence in 1999, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier initiative in 2000, and the declaration of 2005 as the Year of the Veteran. Those are just a few examples of what the Royal Canadian Legion has achieved.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687461">For over 90 years, the Legion has been an advocate for veterans and has been providing financial assistance to active military personnel, veterans, and their families, whether they are members of the Legion or not. I think that is one of the things that explains why certain veterans associations and the Royal Canadian Legion do not necessarily agree with the objectives of the bill before us.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687462">These days, a majority of the representatives of the Royal Canadian Legion are from civil society and not necessarily veterans. Some of them are family members, relatives, brothers, and sons of military personnel who have served their country, who have passed away or been wounded in combat. These people have decided to volunteer their time to help veterans.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687463">I would like to talk about something that happened in my riding. This year, in Thetford Mines, we came close to not being able to mark Remembrance Day, Armistice Day. Unfortunately, the Royal Canadian Legion in our community had to close its doors after 70 years because of a lack of volunteers. Claude Nadeau, the president of the branch, worked hard to ensure that a ceremony was held every year. He put a lot of effort into bringing together veterans and serving members from our community. </ParaText><ParaText id="4687464">However, since there are not very many veterans or serving members in Thetford Mines, it was becoming increasingly difficult to bring these people together for a ceremony. Our veterans from the last great war have almost all passed away now. We have one or two active members. These people were deeply saddened when they learned that there might not be a Remembrance Day ceremony. That is why, despite the fact that Branch 201 of the Royal Canadian Legion shut down, Mr. Nadeau and a few volunteers still organized a commemorative ceremony.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687465">The same sort of thing happened in another town in my riding, Lac-Mégantic. For the first time in a long time, no Remembrance Day ceremony was held because of a lack of volunteers. If Canadians want an association that helps preserve the memory of our veterans, then they need to understand the essential role that civilians play in the Royal Canadian Legion. </ParaText><ParaText id="4687466"> We therefore need to take into consideration the Royal Canadian Legion's views of Bill <Document DbId="8443206" Type="4">C-311</Document>. We need to listen to what it has to say and find out whether it thinks it is important to pass this bill to make Remembrance Day a legal or statutory holiday. By sending this bill to committee, we would give the Royal Canadian Legion the opportunity to express its views. We owe a great debt to our veterans and also to those who serve them, like the Royal Canadian Legion.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Trudel" id="9292208"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="214168" Type="2">Ms. Karine Trudel (Jonquière, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4687467">Madam Speaker, I am honoured to be able to speak today to Bill <Document DbId="8443206" Type="4">C-311</Document>. This bill has been debated a number of times in the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687468">On reading the bill we see that it seeks to give November 11 official status as Remembrance Day across Canada. However, it does not make Remembrance Day a full-fledged statutory holiday, but instead a legal holiday. The provinces regulate statutory holidays in their own jurisdictions and this bill does nothing to change that and that is too bad. We can continue to mark November 11, but it cannot become a statutory holiday through this bill because that would require provincial legislation. We therefore wonder what purpose this bill serves. </ParaText><ParaText id="4687469">However, I am very pleased to speak to this subject today because my grandfather fought in World War II. He was in the navy. My great-uncle was in the army. When I was 14, he told me stories about the war. At that age, I did not appreciate the gravity of what he experienced. To him, these were pivotal moments.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687470">Now, I am participating in the debate in the House and I am thinking about him. I shared some special times with my great-uncle. Unfortunately, my grandfather, who was in the navy, died when I was 3 years old. Therefore I was unable to learn more about what he went through during the Second World War. My great-uncle had the chance to share his experience with me, and it is with these memories in mind that I am speaking of him.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687471">My father was in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for 35 years. He worked to ensure that our country was safe. This is something I am proud of. Speaking in the House today, I think about my father, who watches me from time to time as well. We have had some good talks about what he experienced during his 35 years of service. </ParaText><ParaText id="4687472"> Today we are talking about all those who protect our country. These are men and women who put their lives on the line each and every day, who have given their all to keep us safe at home and to fight abroad.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687473">It is important for me to commemorate Remembrance Day and to share it. I make it a priority to talk about it in schools. Over the past two or three years, students in my riding, Joliette, have been reviving a tradition that was disappearing: they have been making poppies, and their teachers have been explaining the symbolism of the poppy to them and the importance of remembering what happened. I often say that it is important to know and remember what happened so we do not repeat the mistakes of the past and so we can go forward.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687474">I would also like to say a few words about the Arvida branch of the Royal Canadian Legion. I have had the pleasure of getting to know these people since becoming an MP, and they are like a second family. The Arvida branch of the Royal Canadian Legion offers extraordinary support and networking. Branch 209 was founded in 1947, but its current home was built in 1962 by the veterans themselves. Now the building is in need of repair and needs quite a few renovations. The veterans themselves are working on renovating it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687475">The branch has 150 members, and I am proud to say that the ladies' auxiliary has 130 members. It goes without saying that spouses of people in the armed forces and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police are involved too. The whole family is involved, actually. When people go off on missions, their children and spouses worry. That is why members of the ladies' auxiliary are involved with the Arvida branch of the Royal Canadian legion. They do so much work in the community.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4687476">Some veterans are active in the Fonds de dotation Santé Jonquière, the Jonquière hospital's endowment fund, to help the hospital purchase new research equipment and other new machines. Some veterans have helped create scholarships for veterans. They also raise funds to help children pursue their studies, which I think is amazing.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687477">Getting back to the main point of my speech, Remembrance Day, it is obvious that commemoration is important to veterans.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687478">The Sunday prior to Remembrance Day, I attended a poppy celebration with some veterans. They have a ceremony, and it is quite an event. We also have poppy week, and all veterans participate. They go to shopping malls and schools to raise money to support veterans, including both retired and active military personnel. Unfortunately, many veterans require assistance at some point in their career. </ParaText><ParaText id="4687479">For veterans, it is very important to remember. In the spring I had the opportunity to present a medal to a veteran. It was the highest honour a veteran can receive. Mr. Boivin, who is now 90 years old, had taken part in the Normandy landing. How incredible.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687480">I felt quite moved and fortunate to present him with his medal and this honour. He said he did nothing more than his duty. I was proud to present him with his medal. All he cared about was serving our country and ensuring our safety, but also remembering what happened. Unfortunately, many of his comrades did not come back home with him. Mr. Boivin told me he lost members of his family. Those sad moments make him want to remember what happened all the more. That is to his credit because he and his wife have been on an emotional roller coaster over the years.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687481">For some veterans at the Arvida branch of the Royal Canadian Legion, the war left physical scars. For some, the injuries changed their lives forever, hence the importance of the support they get at the Legion. The Legion not only helps the community, but it also enables veterans to help each other and that support is important.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687482">In my opinion, November 11 has to be a time for gathering and remembrance, a time when we remember what veterans did for us.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687483">I would like to come back to educating children. Our role as MPs involves sharing information with our young people and explaining to them what Remembrance Day is all about. Unfortunately, it seems to be losing its meaning as time goes by. Federal MPs are in a good position to go explain the purpose of Remembrance Day to students. </ParaText><ParaText id="4687484">I will close by saying that I am a bit disappointed by this bill. As I said at the beginning of my speech, the bill makes Remembrance Day a legal holiday. Since statutory holidays fall under provincial jurisdiction, I am wondering how the bill will be implemented.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687485"> Of course, as I said before, the Bagotville military base is in my riding. It employs over 2,000 soldiers, and many veterans have also worked there. I am in regular contact with them, and I know that they think it is important for us to remember what they have done.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687486">I am very proud to have had the opportunity to speak to Bill <Document DbId="8443206" Type="4">C-311</Document> today.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4687488">I would like to thank the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214518" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> for his initiative in bringing forward this very important private member's bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687489">This bill would make Remembrance Day a national legal holiday. I would like to begin my comments on the importance of remembering and honouring the contributions of our veterans, as well as what it means to me personally.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687490">Once again, as I have said many times in the House, Nova Scotia has the largest veteran population per capita in the country and my riding of Sackville—Preston—Chezzetcook has up to 23%, who are either veterans who have served or who are in the military today. As everyone can understand, the people in my riding are extremely proud of the distinguished record and service to our country.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687491">I hear about that service from veterans often, whether it be at legions, town halls, or even at grocery stores. They share many stories with me. These are compassionate, caring, and humble men and women who continue to serve their communities. They serve their communities as volunteers or hockey coaches, or they just lend a helping hand. I must say that I am extremely impressed when I see them out there and they have each other's backs. It is extremely impressive and a learning curve that I have had the opportunity to observe that much more in the last year.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687492">It is of utmost importance that their service continues to be honoured for generations to come. This bill would ensure that Canadians from coast to coast to coast would have more opportunities to participate in and celebrate Remembrance Day across the country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687493">As a former educator, I can say that schools in Nova Scotia have done an exemplary job, year after year, in raising awareness through sharing some of the sacrifices that past generations have made. This is extremely important for people keep in their memories: to remember their service for decades past but also today and in the future. This bill would complement the good work that is being done in schools across this country.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687494">When I talk about Remembrance Day, it is important to remind ourselves of the people we are honouring. I will provide some examples. A retired master corporal in my riding named Jon bravely served our country abroad, completing two tours in Afghanistan in 2006 and 2009, each for six months. He served in the Canadian Armed Forces from 2002 until 2012, 10 years, and was medically released in 2012 due to injuries sustained in the line of duty. We owe him a sincere debt of gratitude.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687495">I also think about a sergeant I had the opportunity to meet and spend time with in the last year. His name is Rollie. Rollie served in the Canadian Armed Forces from 1982 until 2002. He did tours in Germany and the former Yugoslavia in 1994 and 1995. Unfortunately, Rollie was diagnosed in 2000 with PTSD. This is a difficult condition that many veterans face when they return home from abroad. These occupational stress injuries make it especially difficult for veterans when they return to normal civilian life.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687496">I am amazed by the contributions that veterans are making in our communities every day. Rollie is one of many who has become an advocate for the veterans community. He has been part of a group in Sackville—Preston—Chezzetcook and works closely with others to advocate for a walk-in clinic that would support veterans with unique needs.</ParaText>

Of course, this is basically a symbolic gesture, but it is important to do what we can to make sure that Remembrance Day is recognized and continues to be recognized throughout the years forward, even though so many of the veterans who were part of World War I and World War II are at an age that makes it very difficult for them to be able to attend and be part of the ceremonies. In Yorkton this year, it was just so overwhelming for me to see the veterans make the huge effort that it takes to be there and be part of that ceremony, and to stand even though it is so difficult to stand and make sure that this is not forgotten. Regardless of the approach that we take, the important thing is that we do remember.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687510">The fact that it is at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month is very fitting. From our veterans and being part of different ceremonies, we start to realize how important these special traditions are to our veterans and to our armed forces as well. I recently attended the 64th field battery 10th field artillery regiment, Saint Barbara celebration in my home city of Yorkton with our reservists there. It was something to listen and to learn about why they take each of the steps they do during that celebration. It is all part of building up that community and making sure we value each other as reservists. That is one example where I say we need to make sure that, whatever approach we take as a legislature in our communities, the total focus is on valuing our veterans and keeping that in front of other generations as they come forward.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687511">My grandson was born on November 11. It is a very special day to him, and he always says, “Grandma, the first half of the day is very sad”, and he talks about Remembrance Day and they always go to and are part of the services. He says, “And then the second half of the day is very happy”. I thought that was something that he is being taught the value of the individuals who stood up for Canada to keep it as the free country that it is today, and it is very much a part of his psyche. I thought that was very special.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687512">I also had the opportunity as a new member of Parliament to attend the Battle of the Atlantic gala, and attend the ceremonies on Parliament Hill. Again, members of the regiments, the cadets, the reserves, and the navy were all there on time ready to start this event. It was so bitter cold outside. I was sitting out on the lawn waiting for this to start, and I was beyond cold. I think I was as cold as I have ever been in my life, and thinking, “I do not think I am going to make it”. Then I looked across the grounds, and there were 80- and 90-something year-old veterans sitting there waiting for the event to happen. It was pouring rain, but they were sitting there with their jackets on. They were not putting on their caps or carrying their umbrellas until the very last moment. They were choosing to sit there and persevere through the cold. When I put that together with the battle gala and saw the pictures, I saw that these elderly men were the same men who were so young on those ships getting the supplies across the Atlantic. Seeing the pictures of them caked in ice is what got me through the event, and just made me so proud in my heart to be a part of that particular celebration.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687513">There are army cadet reviews, and opportunities when we go home to our riding to be a part of those celebrations as well. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="45">(1145)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4687514">It is really important that we do whatever we can to make sure we are recognizing everything our veterans have done for us. We have to make sure that within our school systems, they are learning about the different battles and the amazing things Canadians have done.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687515">I just learned that our soldiers had to take on the Battle of Vimy Ridge after France had lost 200,000 men on that hill and Britain had lost 100,000. Our troops came together for the first time as Canadians from across the country, put their heads together, and devised what they would do. They ended up laying out the whole battlefield behind them to practice what was ahead of them. How did they do this? Our young aboriginal soldiers went out in the dead of night and basically mapped out the whole area. We were able to go forward and win that battle, starting at five in the morning and ending at noon.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687516">We have so much to be proud of as Canadians because of our veterans and armed forces. I know that in Afghanistan, the question was asked of the Taliban, “Do you fear western forces?” They said, “No, except the Canadians”. That says so much about our armed forces.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687517">That being said, it is very important that we do these things to celebrate, commemorate, and remember. We fall short if we do not do everything we can as legislators in this House and on the committee, which I am on, to make sure that we are truly caring for our armed forces when they transition to the veteran's life. We need to do whatever we can to make sure that the transition is as painless as possible and that they are recognized for what they have done. They sacrifice their families, their own choices, and their own decision-making to become part of the armed forces. They stand side by side and serve for us, then come back to the very difficult circumstance of transitioning to civilian life.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687518">It is a pleasure to serve on that committee. There are many things we are working on with our report, and I am certainly hopeful that the government will do everything it can to look at the recommendations from us, and from the two ombudsmen, to make sure that we are doing everything we can to close that seam and deal with circumstances that have been left hanging for a very long time.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687519">One of those is the issue of mefloquine and how it impacted our soldiers in Somalia, Rwanda, Afghanistan, and other battlefields. There are a number of heartbreaking stories coming from veterans who have lived with the results of this and are not being recognized for having suffered from what this actually is. It is not just PTSD. It is a brain injury as well. Our government needs to recognize that this particular anti-malaria drug is not being used by the rest of the world. </ParaText><ParaText id="4687520">We are falling behind in making some of the decisions that say to our veterans that they are important to us and that we will do whatever it takes to ensure that they are cared for in the way they should be.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687521">We talk about caring about our veterans and about how much we want to recognize them but then do not do what needs to be done. This does not mean huge changes. It means simply putting things in place to ensure that veterans do not end up more ill after coming home because of the stress of getting settled in their new civilian lives.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687522">One of the things we heard over and over again was about family life and how difficult it is for the other parent and the children to deal with the challenges of being an armed forces family and a veteran's family. We need to be there to support them in taking care of the soldier who has come home.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687523"> We need to tell our veterans that they really matter to us and that they matter to us every day of the year, from the moment they sign up with our forces right up to when they retire or have to quit because of an injury. We need to put real meat on these things. I am not making light of that at all. We need to commemorate what they have done for us.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4687524">There is another issue we are all facing right now, which is medical marijuana. Veterans are concerned about the fact that the government is considering legalizing marijuana for recreational use. They are concerned about how this would dumb down the importance of it as a medical prescription. I regularly hear stories about how this is replacing pharmaceuticals for so many veterans, with far fewer side effects, and about improvements in dealing with their pain so they can get on with their lives. It is not costing us anywhere near what it costs to have them on pharmaceuticals.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687525">Those are just some issues that come to mind when I think about commemorating our veterans. We certainly want to do this. I am so proud to have a role as deputy critic, to be involved in specific instances in my riding, and to be part of making decisions that are good for them.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

If this legislation will help draw attention to that crisis, we will be better for having supported it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687528">In addition, the veterans who fought so bravely overseas fought for the freedom of the most vulnerable, but they also fought to protect certain key values: equality, democracy, and liberty. We should promote these values every day of our lives.

We also share the desire to ensure that we are appropriately honouring those brave Canadians in uniform who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687533"> My bill is a modest measure that seeks to change the language in the Holidays Act to make Remembrance Day a legal holiday and to ensure that consistency of language is reflected in the act. This bill would ensure consistency with both Canada Day and Victoria Day in the Holidays Act and would elevate the status of Remembrance Day to put it on an equal footing with those other days. </ParaText><ParaText id="4687534">Some have expressed that this provision would do more than that. Let me be clear that my bill, by adding the word “legal”, would not impact the Canada Labour Code, which establishes the policy on non-working days for holidays. Federally speaking, the day is already and will remain a federal paid non-working day.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687535">Furthermore, and I want to be very clear on this point, it is up to each province and territory to determine whether Remembrance Day on November 11 is a statutory holiday or a day off in their jurisdiction. This is what determines whether there is no school and whether it is a public paid non-working day.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687536"> This bill does not and cannot make Remembrance Day a national holiday, because it is not within the purview of Parliament to do so. I am hoping that this bill may provide an occasion for the provinces and territories that do not already do so to determine whether Remembrance Day should indeed be a statutory holiday.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687537"> I note that some of my colleagues in the debate have mentioned that the bill would not make it a statutory holiday, and it cannot, but what it can do is elevate the day, put it on an equal footing, and hopefully provide an occasion for those jurisdictions that do not already do so to allow it to be a statutory day.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687538">There are examples of other jurisdictions that do not mark the day as a so-called statutory holiday, but they mark the solemn occasion in other ways. For example, in my home province of Nova Scotia, it is separate from other statutory holidays, but it is kept in force under the Remembrance Day Act to ensure that people have time off to attend ceremonies. I would like to see this across the country, but of course, our Constitution requires that we respect the jurisdiction of provinces in this regard.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687539">I want to address one issue that has been brought up by some who oppose the bill, which is the argument that students should be in school on November 11 to ensure that they are marking the day and reflecting on what November 11 at 11 a.m. means for our country. I respect their point of view. However, in my experience in Nova Scotia, and I believe in most places in Canada, it is far more meaningful for the students to learn the importance of Remembrance Day and the sacrifices of our forces in the days leading up to November 11.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687540"> Veterans come into the schools during Veterans' Week, and in addition to the teaching, there is also a remembrance service in schools, which veterans attend. Of course, if these were marked on November 11 at 11 a.m., veterans marking the occasion with the community could not attend those school services. However, if students had time off, they could mark November 11 in the community with veterans at their public ceremonies. We have seen increasing attendance, including by children and their families, in Nova Scotia. </ParaText><ParaText id="4687541">I believe that all Canadians should be able to have the same experience and that all veterans should have the opportunity to be publicly appreciated for their service and remembered on November 11 at a collective experience with the whole community.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687542">As I mentioned in my speech to begin this debate, proposed subsections 3(2) and 3(3) are not at all essential to my intent in raising the profile of Remembrance Day. Since I now recognize that those are problematic provisions, I support their removal at committee, and I will be asking the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage for their removal if the bill is sent to it following a debate at second reading. We should therefore turn our minds to just proposed subsection 3(1) of this bill.</ParaText>

This is the 2015 version of the Liberals, though, so maybe things have changed. Under the topic of openness, transparency, and fairness, they said on the site that the Conservative government had broken Canadians' trust and that the Liberals had a solution for this. One of the problems the Liberals had at the time was the use of this tactic that we're seeing them use here today. After just one hour, notice was given that debate would be shut off. The Liberals decried this in opposition and said it was no wonder that Canadians were ready for real change. The Liberals said that they were going to send resolutions to Ottawa that, in their words, would “make sure that Parliament is at a place where all Canadians can serve their country. A Liberal government will restore Parliament as a place where accountable people with real mandates do serious work”.</ParaText>

Therefore, the variable we need to control for is the laziness of the government. There were122 bills that received royal assent in the last Parliament, and there were 102 time allocation motions.

To date in this Parliament, there have been nine bills that have received royal assent, and eight time allocation motions on those bills that received royal assent. That is a rate of 0.89.

That is what we are facing here again today. We are seeing a government that is very proud of the fact that 60 members of Parliament have spoken to this. Last time I checked, there were 336 members in the House of Commons currently, with two vacancies, so that is fewer than 20% of members of Parliament being afforded an opportunity to speak to the budget implementation act. The government has brought down the hammer. It has shut off debate. It does not want members of Parliament to speak in the House. </ParaText><ParaText id="4687663">It is kind of funny. I just did the Liberals' MyDemocracy.ca survey where they ask things like, “Do you think members of Parliament should better represent their constituents or should they toe the party line?” We have seen their preference here today. Instead of representing their constituents, getting up and defending their own budget, they get up and defend cutting off debate in the House. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687664">It is shameful but it is becoming a part of their routine business. They said, “Trust us. We will do things so much differently.” They talked about real change. The only real change is, after Friday, a single hour of debate on the budget implementation act at this stage, they brought in time allocation. For the people at home, that means they no longer want members of Parliament to be able to debate this. </ParaText><ParaText id="4687665">It is no wonder the Liberals do not want Canadians and members of Parliament debating the bill, because it is about their economic performance. The budget implementation act speaks to their ineptitude, quite frankly, on the economy. That is what we are seeing day after day and time after time. Their economic plan, if we could even call it that, is not working. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687666">Statistics Canada said on Friday that for the second month in a row all job gains were in part-time positions and noticed the jobless rate only fell because fewer people were seeking work. Some 8,700 full-time jobs were lost in November. Gluskin Sheff chief economist David Rosenberg said that the latest numbers were clearly a case of “nice headline, shame about the details”. In fact, full-time employment in Canada has not risen in almost a year and a half. What happened just a little over a year ago? This government took office. Since it has taken office, it has not created a single net full-time new job. It is outrageous. </ParaText><ParaText id="4687667">The Liberals talk about how we need to get this passed so that they can deliver on their economic platform. We need to prevent that from happening as much as possible because it has been an unmitigated disaster. They have misled Canadians time after time, and their budget is the primary example of where they have done that. </ParaText><ParaText id="4687668">I want to continue to quote from David Rosenberg. He said the Liberal economic performance is “in a word, pathetic and attests to a usually high level of uncertainty among the business community, writ large”. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687669">There were 8,700 jobs lost just in November. That was in addition to the 100,000 jobs that have been lost in the energy sector since the government took office. Its plan, if we can call it that, is simply failing Canadians. </ParaText><ParaText id="4687670">The budget, and the budget implementation act, is a litany of broken promises. The Liberals promised in the last campaign that they would have a $10-billion deficit and that it would be gone within the time of their mandate, that within four years there would be no deficit and we would be back to a balanced budget. One year later, it is now a $30-billion deficit, and there is no plan to ever get back to a balanced budget. That is the Liberal record. They no longer even pretend they are going to get back to a balanced budget. That is after our Conservative government left them with $2.9 billion in surplus, and over 1.3 million net new jobs was our record. In one year, they have blown through the entire contingency fund they had set aside in their first budget and they are three times more money in debt.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687671">What does that mean? It means that future generations, our children and grandchildren, will pay higher taxes to pay that money back. Canadians know, when they borrow money, they have to pay it back. The government has said that it was just going to borrow a little bit. It was going to spur the economy on to create all kinds of jobs. It has not happened. It is a record of broken promises. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4687672">The Liberals also said that they would be cutting the small business tax rate for communities like mine in Chilliwack—Hope. Small and medium-sized enterprises in Chilliwack—Hope are the backbone of my community. Every major party in this place promised in the last election that we would cut the small business tax rate to 9% from 11%. Every single one of us here in the major recognized parties campaigned on cutting the small business tax rate to 9%.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687673">What did we see? The Liberals got into power, and it said sorry to all the small business owners who create all of the jobs in this country, but they did not have the money for them. They had to spend it on other things. They are running a $30-billion deficit, but they cannot afford to keep their promise to them. Instead, they are going to raise their payroll taxes and make it more expensive for them to hire people. Not only were they not going to give them the break they promised, but they are going to make it more expensive.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687674">It is no surprise, given the comments of the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> during the campaign when he said that small businesses were simply a way for rich Canadians to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. This is what the Liberal Party believes about small business in Canada, that they are simply avoiding taxes and avoiding their obligations to Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687675">The Liberals are making life more expensive for the people in my riding by raising their taxes. They talk as well about how they are raising taxes on the wealthiest Canadians and cutting them for lowest-income Canadians, except they are doing nothing of the sort.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687676">In my riding, the average income is $34,787 per year. Guess how much the average income earner in Chilliwack—Hope got from the Liberal tax cuts? It is zero. They do not make enough money to qualify for the Liberal tax cuts, because they kick in at $45,000 a year. Therefore, the person who actually makes the most money from the Liberal income tax cuts is someone making $199,000 a year. That might be who the Liberals represent, but in my riding, that is not who I represent. I represent middle and low-income Canadians who are looking for a break. They were promised a tax break from the current government and they got nothing.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687677">Another group that has gotten nothing from the government is the natural resource sector. I was honoured to be named the natural resources critic, and it is a tough time for our natural resource industries. Right now in committee, we have been studying the mining industry. Mining company after mining company has come before the committee to say that a carbon tax will put more people out of work, and it may prevent projects from even starting. That is how serious this is. </ParaText><ParaText id="4687678">The government has not adjusted its plan at all, given the surprising outcome in the United States where we now have president-elect Trump, who says he is going to cut corporate and business taxes. He has no intention of bringing in a carbon tax. Yet the Liberals continue on as though nothing has changed, as if it is still going to be Barack Obama in the White House in another month or so.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687679">Things have changed. The landscape has dramatically shifted. If we do not adjust, we will continue to see massive outflows of capital from the natural resource sector to other jurisdictions. Businesses are going to leave this country, jobs are going to leave this country, and yet the government has done nothing except make it more expensive for businesses to operate in Canada. It is shameful. The 100,000 lost jobs in the energy sector that have happened since the current government took office will seem like the good old days if it continues down this path where people continue to look for lower-cost jurisdictions in which to operate. </ParaText><ParaText id="4687680">Therefore, this is not a plan to get Canadians back to work. It is not a plan to make life more affordable for Canadians. It is a failed plan. It is a litany of broken promises. We on this side of the House will not support it.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

As I said earlier, this bill will help families and all Canadians. Naturally, I encourage our colleagues to support it.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687700">Our government made a solemn promise to Canadians. We promised to help members of the middle class who work hard every day and those who are working hard to join it. The government built its 2016 budget around them, and I am proud to speak in favour of that budget in the House today. I am particularly proud to speak in favour of the <Document DbId="8519336" Type="3">Budget Implementation Act, 2016, No. 2</Document>, which is before us today.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687701"> Our government has tabled a bold budget, one that considers all those who are supporting their families through their work and yet feel they still cannot catch up. Therefore the government is going to stimulate the economy through measures that foster the growth of the middle class, because when the economy is working for the middle class, the entire country is pushed into a cycle of growth. We listened to Canadians all over the country before tabling this budget, and what we heard is that they need a financial breather. </ParaText><ParaText id="4687702"> One of the budget’s primary measures is therefore an income tax reduction. Almost nine million Canadians have more money in their pockets thanks to one of our government’s very first measures. That measure has been to reduce income taxes for the middle class, putting them in a better position to save or invest in their own priorities.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687703"> Families are at the heart of the middle class. In this bold budget, we find a social innovation that directly affects families living in each of the constituencies represented here in the House. This innovation, called the Canada child benefit, came into effect last July 1. I will cite the numbers for the House, since they speak for themselves. Those who are watching us today know this very well. For each child under six years of age, a family can receive up to $6,400 a year, that is, $533 per month for each child.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687704"> For children between six and 17 years of age, the allowance is up to $5,400 per year, or a maximum of $450 per month for each child. This is an innovation because it is a direct investment in the country’s middle class. The Canada child benefit is producing results which can be felt all over the country, in each of our constituencies.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687705"> First of all, the Canada child benefit is much more generous than the previous benefit. For the families affected by this change, this represents close to an average of $2,300 for the 2016-17 benefit year. Next, it is simpler: families get a single payment every month. It is also tax-free, as the money received does not have to be partially refunded on the income tax return. It is also better targeted, since low- or medium-income families receive higher benefits, while families with very high incomes receive lower benefits than what they received under the previous system.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687706"> I am delighted to tell the House that the bill that we are debating today will only increase this benefit, and at the same time improve the lot of this country’s children and their families. There are also plans to index benefits to inflation starting on July 1, 2020, which means that benefits will rise with the cost of living. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687707"> In addition to helping Canadians, the bill also protects them as consumers, and that protection is tailored to their needs. This bill strengthens and modernizes the protection framework for consumers of financial products and services. We must also ensure that the financial system is adaptable. It met the challenge of the 2008 crisis and demonstrated its soundness to the world.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4687708"> Traditional business models are nonetheless upset by technological innovations, new consumer demands, and new modes of consumption. Accordingly, the banking sector has to adapt. </ParaText><ParaText id="4687709"> What the bill proposes is to simplify and consolidate the current consumer provisions by grouping them under a single section of the Bank Act. It would introduce amendments to the Bank Act to improve consumer protection, that is, to guarantee better access to basic banking services, limit certain business practices, ensure that consumers have access to all the information they need to make informed decisions, ensure that complaints management is better organized, and finally, improve corporate governance and accountability. </ParaText><ParaText id="4687710"> Canada's government is showing leadership by taking this series of steps to strengthen financial protection for Canadians, wherever they may live in the country. This is a matter of maintaining public trust. </ParaText><ParaText id="4687711"> I have a little time left to talk about another important measure in this bill, specifically the legislation to combat international tax evasion and tax avoidance. </ParaText><ParaText id="4687712"> Our country already has measures to combat non-compliance with tax law. However it is important to fight tax evasion and tax avoidance in co-operation with other countries and international organizations.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687713">This bill proposes the adoption of tools and procedures originating in the G20 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the OECD. </ParaText><ParaText id="4687714"> First of all, there is country-by-country reporting. This is an instrument that will oblige big corporations to report their activities and the nature of those activities in each jurisdiction where they operate. This will enable the Canada Revenue Agency to have a global view of the activities of multinationals. The interest of this tool is that it can tax the profits of companies in the countries where those profits are made. This is then an initial measure to combat aggressive tax avoidance.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687715"> A second instrument provided in the bill applies to tax evasion. It was developed by the OECD and is called the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters. It will compel Canadian financial institutions to put mechanisms in place to identify all accounts held by non-resident Canadians. This information will have to be transmitted to the Canada Revenue Agency. The 100 or so countries and jurisdictions that have adopted this standard will also identify accounts held by foreign nationals, including Canadians. Next, a series of security mechanisms will be introduced to ensure that this information is exchanged among the standard’s signatories. </ParaText><ParaText id="4687716"> These measures constitute a step forward for compliance with tax obligations for all Canadians and all businesses established in Canada. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687717">I encourage all members of the House to vote in favour of this bill because it will help every family in our country. There are people who expect this Parliament to take responsibility and pass this bill in order to help families in need in Canada.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I was mayor of a community of about 20,000 people. When we look at the current formula that was in place for many years, it was a one-third formula. The municipality had to come up with the first one-third, the provincial government the second one-third, and the federal government the third one-third. For small communities, coming up with that first one-third is a real challenge. I will give a quick example. In Cranbrook, if we wanted to raise $1 million through property taxes, every 1% increase in property tax equalled $200,000. To raise $1 million to meet our one-third was a 5% increase in property taxes. One is not very popular as a mayor with a 5% increase in property taxes to cover one project.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687749">As the infrastructure project funding rolls out, we need to make sure that the federal government provides at least 50% of the infrastructure dollars and that the provinces continue to provide their 33 1/3%, reducing municipalities' input to a little over 16%.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687750">Infrastructure funding needs to be long term, so that municipalities can plan. It should not just be one year at a time. We need to change the definition of infrastructure. Those of us who have worked for municipalities know that infrastructure is generally considered to be sewer, water, roads, and storm drains. We need to have dark fiber and high-speed Internet as a basic fundamental piece of infrastructure in all communities moving forward.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687751">It is great to see some money in infrastructure, but how that money rolls out is important. In 2014, the Conservatives announced a multi-billion infrastructure program, and none of it made it to us in the municipalities that year, at least in rural areas. In the end, my Conservative colleague at the time, who was our member of Parliament, blamed the province for not getting on board and getting the money out. However, we need to make sure that the infrastructure dollars actually make it into communities.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4687752">I want to talk a bit about private sector involvement in infrastructure. We had one project in Cranbrook prior to when I became mayor, which was our recreational complex. It was a private-public partnership. That partnership went bad, and the city had to buy out the private partner. We ended up with about 15-year's worth of loans, locked in at 8% and higher, that we could not get out of, even though as a municipality we could borrow money at about 2% from a special fund in British Columbia. From Cranbrook's perspective, privatization of infrastructure does not work.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687753">The thought of selling airports or bridges to reduce this $30 billion to $40-billion deficit is absolutely the wrong way to try to get a deficit under control. We do not sell assets in order to pay down debt.</ParaText><ParaText id="4687754">Those are a few of the ways that the budget could be improved. There are some good things in the budget, but there are many ways to make it better. I hope that we can see a better future for poverty, for small businesses, and the way that infrastructure is handled in Canada, and, of course, in Kootenay—Columbia.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Our culture and cultural products are the instruments that help us communicate with others and share different views, entertaining and informing us, all the while weaving together a shared sense of identity.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688121">Culture is at the heart of every community across our country and around the world, and Canada is a testament to the ability to include and respect all cultures in one society. Perhaps we are uniquely poised to be welcoming and accepting due to the way our country was founded as distinct societies coming together to found one country. People from other parts of the world quickly joined, adding their cultures and traditions to the fabric of our country, weaving the ever-changing tapestry that is Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="4688122">Our government has a solemn duty to act as a steward of Canada's cultural institutions and an obligation to promote and foster the institutions, activities, and people that help our culture flourish, grow, and adapt to changing times and circumstances.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688123">Our cultural mediums help us to exchange diverse ideas and experiences, and the conversations they invoke are the greatest celebrations of the diversity that is at the heart of Canadian culture. They also make a significant contribution to our economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688124">Over the years, the number of companies and individuals involved in producing cultural products has grown dramatically. One of the companies that has always been at the heart of Canadian content is the CBC. There are some on the opposition benches who would like to see the CBC eliminated. Strikingly, they are some of the same members who seem most out of touch with what true Canadian values are. The CBC not only ensures that all Canadians have access to Canadian content, but that every Canadian can also access local content.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688125">The reality is that in a country as vast as Canada, there will be areas where it does not make financial sense for profit-driven entities to produce local content. Every Canadian deserves to know what is going on in their area of the country, and to partake in the shared experience of cultural exchanges that build communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688126">To that end, I am proud to say that our government has invested $675 million in the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation/Radio Canada to disseminate and support world-class Canadian content and to provide Canadians with better access to programs and services in the digital era.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688127">Since I know this question will be coming from my Conservative colleagues, I will address it now. Yes, I am aware that CBC/Radio Canada has asked for an additional $400 million from the government. The opposition has made great fanfare of this request, decrying it as just a cash grab. What they fail to mention, however, is that this request comes because CBC/Radio Canada wants to eliminate all ads.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688128">I would like to ask those watching to think about what this means for our national broadcaster. Much like the BBC, our national broadcaster can give strong, stable, well-funded public broadcasts with the primary goal of serving the interests of domestic audiences and diverse communities in helping to promote Canadian content. Agree or disagree, this is an idea worth seriously considering, and I am happy the government is doing just that.</ParaText>

I am therefore very proud that our government has decided to invest in the spaces and institutions that serve as guardians of our cultural objects, including our national museums, our national historic sites, and our parks.

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Richards" id="9293947"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="214548" Type="2">Mr. Blake Richards (Banff—Airdrie, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4688155">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the Liberal government's budget. It seems to me that we are stuck in a tax-and-spend cycle with the current Liberal government. Every time we turn around, it seems that the Liberals are finding another way to try to increase government spending, with no regard for Canadian taxpayers. Therefore, we see an increase in taxation, and the prospect for future generations of further increases in their taxation, as a result of large deficits and debt left behind by the government through all of this spending.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688156">When the Liberal government released its fall economic update, it confirmed what we already knew. Liberals are spending so recklessly that they are going to have to borrow more money, and they have no plan to return to balanced budgets. I stand here today because on this side of the House we believe that fiscal responsibility, a framework for creating a strong economy, and a plan to create jobs and get Canadians back to work are what Canadians need and what they have asked for. We will continue to be the ones who stand up for the hard-working taxpayers of this country and hold the Liberal government accountable for its out-of-control spending.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688157">In discussions I have had with constituents, through town halls and a survey prior to the introduction of the 2016 budget, along with a number of other methods that we conduct through the year, the one common link, the underlying concern that constituents had, was about ballooning deficits they were seeing from the Liberal government. This is simply not a solution to Canada's economic challenges. In fact, nearly every constituent who was surveyed indicated that a balanced federal budget was important, almost unanimously. This obviously comes in very stark contrast to what we see in the budget implementation act.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688158">When it comes to broken promises, the Liberals ran on a campaign promise to cap deficits at $10 billion a year and return more to a balanced budget in 2019-20. That frankly was not good enough to begin with, but that was their promise. Instead, they are spending deficits of nearly three times that amount, almost $30 billion in borrowed money. This is in their first year alone. Through the budget implementation act that we have before us today, the Liberals will continue to run deficits, and with no explanation whatsoever about how or when they will return to a balance. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688159">The Liberals may try to blame higher deficits on a weak economy or lower revenues, but it is very clear from the parliamentary budget officer and the Finance Canada “Fiscal Monitor” that Liberal spending is the real culprit. Hard-working Canadians across the country run their personal finances with fiscal restraint. They know that when they run out of money and keep spending, they are going to have an issue. Why does it seem like the Liberal government has such an issue with this concept? The budget is a steep deficit trajectory with no intention to return to balance and no clear plan to create jobs. That is pretty evident when they have not actually created a single net job since they were elected over a year ago. There is nothing to help get thousands of unemployed Canadians back to work. When it comes to managing an economy, there is no second chance. Clearly, Canadians are worse off today than they were a year ago.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688160">The budget still offers no insights into how the government plans to create jobs. Unfortunately, the forecasting by the Liberals is not reliable either. When our previous government introduced a stimulus package in response to the global financial crisis, we used outside experts to vet our estimate of 220,000 jobs that would be created or maintained. The target was actually exceeded by 28,000 jobs.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688161">In contrast, the parliamentary budget office reported in October that despite their out-of-control spending and their skyrocketing deficits, the Liberals have not created one net full-time job since they took office, not one; not a single job. The report also stated that the number of part-time jobs that were created in the last year is only half the average rate of job creation of the previous five years. All of them were part-time jobs.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4688162">Further, in comparison, while Canada's employment rate has been falling, rates in the U.S., G7, and OECD have risen. It is very clear that despite a year of reckless spending, the Liberal plan has done nothing to improve our economy. Instead of supporting real job creators, the Liberals are making it more expensive for companies to hire and raising taxes on the small businesses that employ 95% of Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688163"> For small businesses, the budget reneges on promises to lower the small business tax rate that were planned in the last Conservative budget, from 11% to 9%. Instead, the Liberals will hold the rate at 10.5% and have introduced new conditions around eligibility. I will get to those in a second.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688164">It is not only that, but the budget did not renew the tax credit for El premiums paid by small business, and over $1 billion in new El expenditures points to higher premiums for all employers in the near future.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688165">All of this drives away jobs and drives away investment. Now the Liberals are talking about a federal carbon tax, and we know what impact that will have on every Canadian family's budget. We know what it will mean for businesses and their costs. Again, it is further costs being added to families, further costs being added to businesses who are trying to employ Canadians.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688166">Not only are the Liberals not creating jobs, but they are not even going to enable the private sector to do the job it wants to do, which is to create jobs. They are also saying to some small businesses that they are too small to be small businesses, so they are now going to be increasing their tax bills. For some of these small businesses we are talking about, when they deal with rules around active and passive income, they will see a tripling of their tax bills. This will put people out of business, and it will put more Canadians out of work.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688167"> I also want to touch on our natural resources industry and the workers it supports. The Liberals have imposed arbitrary, political, and unpredictable regulatory processes at a time when we urgently need to get our resources to new markets and when we should be supporting our natural resource workers. While unemployment in Alberta continues to climb, the Liberal government's budget fails to address support measures for our natural resource workers.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688168">Skilled workers are struggling to provide for their families and are being forced to leave the province to seek better opportunities for employment. The number of unemployed Albertans has nearly doubled since the start of 2015. It went from 112,500 in January last year to 206,900 in August 2016, up 84.6%.</ParaText>

Unfortunately, I have so many points that I want to raise about the nature of this terrible budget that I will have to leave some of them out. Of course, we can thank the Liberal government for that as well. They have indicated that we are going to have a limited debate on this, so unfortunately there is no opportunity to raise all the points we would like to raise.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688170">I want to touch on the point of infrastructure. I think I have already made it clear that the Liberals are completely oblivious to the needs of Alberta energy workers and getting them back to work. The budget certainly reflects that.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688171">When we talk about the infrastructure program, the Liberals claim they are going to create this legacy of infrastructure. However, when we look at it, most of the claims are quite false, because it is in the so-called phase two of the plan where we will see most of the infrastructure. Most of these things will not even be realized for at least six years. Until then, the municipalities are basically out of luck.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688172">The Liberals have taken a huge chunk of this fund and put it into an infrastructure bank, which means small communities across the country are out of luck because they do not have access to any of that We talk about them having to be massive projects of $100 million or more.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688173">On top of all that, we have higher taxes. We keep hearing from the government how families are better off. I asked my constituents if they were better off. I went to their doors and asked them in a survey. Over and over again, what I heard was no, that they were worse off. The government has taken away some of their tax credits for income splitting, fitness, arts, education, textbooks, their ability to save through tax-free savings accounts, and that it is forcing new mandatory premiums increases on them for the Canada pension plan.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688174"> It goes on and on. Then, of course, the cherry on top is the carbon tax. We are not all looking forward to that one. My constituents are telling me that they are going to be worse off.</ParaText>

The hard-working single mother wants to know that the federal government is committed to a national strategy on inclusive, sustainable, and affordable housing. After living with her two children in unsafe and overcrowded housing for many years, she has finally saved up enough money to carry a modest mortgage for a Habitat for Humanity townhouse unit currently under construction at the 140 Pinery Trail site.

Members will notice that I did not say we created those jobs; far from it. Far be it from any one of us to say that we create jobs. The only jobs governments create are ones in the public sector. We are talking about jobs that were grown in the private sector. Contrast that to today's Liberal government, where we see no new jobs being created. Full-time jobs have been lost and the only added job numbers are part-time jobs.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688227">I want to talk about deficits, but first of all I am going to give a little history lesson. I want to take members back to when the Conservative government was elected in 2006. Those were pretty good days. We saw something that we do not see a lot of now, and that is surpluses in government. During the years 2006, 2007, and partially into 2008, the Conservative government saw fit to tackle the deficit. It was not a great deficit, but any deficit is not a good thing. The Conservative government had the good sense to fight the deficit, to bring the deficit down.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688228">Our Conservative government did that while at the same time lowering the GST by two points. We also lowered other areas of government revenue and paid down the deficit by $37 billion. Contrast that to the 2015 budget. When our Conservative government delivered the budget to the Liberals, we delivered it with the lowest tax rate in 50 years. The typical family was paying $7,000 less in taxes. It was the best record in the G7. </ParaText><ParaText id="4688229">In 2015 the Liberals were elected. They told the electorate that they had a better way of doing things. Did Harper say? They said it was not true, and it almost sounded like a biblical story. The Liberals introduced a new concept of spending more, and they told folks that if they spent more money they could grow the economy. Canadians were used to lower taxes and lower deficits. They had been promised a balanced budget by the Conservatives and that is what they received, and the Liberals were introducing this whole new concept of spending money to improve our lives. This was suspect. The Liberals did say the deficit would be only $10 billion, but that modest deficit ballooned to $30 billion, and it did not stimulate the economy or create any new jobs; no new jobs, no growth.</ParaText>

We like to say that if bank rates are at 0%, then that is a whole different discussion. I know that one day we are going to have that discussion, because it is a non-reality.

Report Stage</ProceduralText><SubjectOfBusinessContent><ParaText id="4688260">The House resumed consideration of Bill <Document DbId="8519336" Type="3">C-29, A second Act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on March 22, 2016 and other measures</Document>, as reported (with amendment) from the committee, and of the motions in Group No. 1.</ParaText><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Fonseca" id="9294670"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="214019" Type="2">Mr. Peter Fonseca (Mississauga East—Cooksville, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4688261">Mr. Speaker, today I take this opportunity to speak to Bill <Document DbId="8519336" Type="3">C-29</Document>, the budget implementation act. This budget will have such a profound, progressive, and positive impact on the families, kids, students, and workers in my riding. It will make a tremendous difference in their lives.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688262"> However, by their nature, budget bills are largely collections of various budget-related matters, and many of these matters can be very technical in nature and mind-numbing, I would say. However, other parts of these bills pertain to matters of substantive policy, including the important policy choices made by governments. I will address you on the parts of this bill that pertain to the important policy decisions made by this government. </ParaText><ParaText id="4688263">The first policy decision made by this government that I will speak to is the Canada child benefit. I refer to its indexing to inflation, the maximum benefit amounts, and the phase-out thresholds under the Canada child benefit beginning in the 2020-21 benefit year. This decision will keep the Canada child benefit up to date, effective, and relevant, regardless of any future inflation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688264">The Canada child benefit is a critical program for Canadians, now and into the future. Our Canada child benefit is responsible for lifting over 300,000 Canadian children above that poverty threshold. In a stroke, it reduced Canada's child poverty rate from 11% to 6%. It cut our child poverty rate nearly in half. That is outstanding. It is something that many of us have talked about for decades and never seen done. To see this happen before our eyes is truly amazing. This is the sort of societal-changing action we all entered into politics to effect.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688265">Moving over 300,000 children out of dire need means nearly one-third of a million Canadian children will eat better, will be better clothed, will be better educated, and will benefit from the opportunities many other Canadian children can take for granted. These opportunities might include soccer lessons, music lessons, or science camps. Not only is this program, which this legislation underpins into the future, the right and decent thing to do, it is the clever thing to do.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688266">Children raised out of poverty have better health outcomes. These better outcomes will save us untold billions of dollars in health costs in the future. Children not burdened by poverty get better educations. These better educated Canadians will result in a more productive Canadian economy in the future.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688267">The increased productivity from this poverty-reduction program will contribute billions in extra Canadian economic growth and Canadian government revenues. Children not haunted by poverty have better life outcomes. They are less likely to suffer from debilitating social problems, such as crime and addiction. Reducing such social problems will not only prevent untold personal grief and tragedy but will save all levels of government more billions of dollars.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688268">Poverty reduction might even have a surprising effect on our democratic system. There is some evidence that increased income increases the likelihood of voting. This makes intuitive sense. If we feel our society has cared about us and our children, we will tend to care more about our society. Therefore, we are likely making more engaged and better citizens with this measure.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688269">It is no wonder that the Canada child benefit has been described as “one of the most ambitious social policies to be implemented in Canada in decades”. Bill <Document DbId="8519336" Type="3">C-29</Document> supports this progressive and ambitious societal change. </ParaText><ParaText id="4688270">Bill <Document DbId="8519336" Type="3">C-29</Document> also makes post-secondary education more affordable for low and middle-income families. Further, it makes it easer to repay any student debt incurred to obtain that post-secondary education. These are yet more progressive and forward-thinking government measures to position Canadians and Canada for the future.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688271">Successful world citizens in the future will not be working harder, but will be working smarter. It is our duty to ensure that Canadians are overrepresented in the future cohort of successful, highly educated world citizens. These budget measures are some of the ways we are fulfilling that duty.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688272"> The measures I have addressed so far relate to our duty to the youngest Canadians and future generations. The measures I now address concern our duty to the most vulnerable of our oldest Canadians, our seniors. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4688273">Currently, these vulnerable seniors—i.e., those couples receiving the guaranteed income supplement under the Old Age Security Act—are penalized when one or both of them become so ill that it requires the couple to split up for health reasons. While they are forced to incur the extra costs of living as two single people, they are not each entitled to the single-person supplement. Currently, they are restricted to the couple supplement only. The couple supplement is less than that for two single persons. </ParaText><ParaText id="4688274">The amendment in the budget would correct that unfairness by allowing each involuntary single to claim that single-person supplement. This would recognize their increased costs, which are beyond their control.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688275">CARP is a 300,000-member national, non-partisan, non-profit organization advocating for financial security and improved health care for Canadians as they age. It “applauds the government for the proposed amendment to the Old Age Security Act, contained within Bill C-29”, and our earlier increase in the guaranteed income supplement. While certainly wanting us to do more, CARP further states, “these amendments have our unconditional support”.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688276">This measure is a part of our commitment to ensuring that Canadian seniors have a dignified, comfortable, and secure retirement. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688277">The bill would also implement the part of the election platform that Canadians voted for last year regarding increases in infrastructure spending, some $180 billion over 12 years. Canada, like the rest of the world, has realized that monetary policy, including the low interest rates that we find ourselves with now, is no cure for sluggish growth. It cannot fix everything. These needed investments are not necessarily made because of the low interest rates. That is why, with government intervention, we are able to get some of that needed infrastructure built. We are in such a situation right now.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688278">We also realize that there is an infrastructure deficit in Canada. Sewer systems, bridges, railroads, social housing, and rural high-speed Internet are but a few of the areas in which we must invest more. The timing is right for this infrastructure push right now. As the British magazine, <I>The Economist</I>, said on October 4, 2014, there are concrete benefits as a result, because “Public investments in infrastructure do the most good at times like the present”.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688279">Municipal leaders, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, are raving about the leadership that we have taken on infrastructure and the improvements that will come to municipalities coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688280">Our current prosperity did not come out of thin air. We have to realize this. It came out of investments and hard work. Canada's most iconic infrastructure investment was the “National Dream”, that is, the building of the transcontinental railway. That investment helped make Canada. It created untold wealth and knitted us together. It is a classic example of the far-sighted infrastructure investment that we need.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688281">We must be equally far-sighted today. There is a myriad of new infrastructure opportunities that exist in public transit, local and regional airports, disaster mitigation, community energy systems, health care facilities, and I could go on and on.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688282">Many societies around the world are confronting new tensions and perhaps even a questioning of the traditional bonds between citizens and their leaders. This legislation would address those strains by emphasizing the inclusive nature of our Canadian democracy.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688283">I am concerned about the state of our democracy and the world's democracies. To that end, I allude to the broader positive societal impact of the measures to help Canadian children whose families are struggling.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688284">I have also highlighted the long-term nation-building implications of infrastructure investment.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688285">We are determined to ensure a strong economy based on a strong middle class. When middle-class Canadians have more money to save, invest, and grow the economy, everyone benefits. These benefits are not only economic, but democratic, social, and cultural. </ParaText>

A consultation is not a monologue. On the contrary, it is a dialogue with the people.</ParaText>

It is very unfortunate that I am doing so under the yoke of time allocation. I feel that today's motion to limit the ability of members of Parliament to give viewpoints on behalf of their constituents was truly a reprehensible motion. The government brought down a guillotine to cut off our ability to speak on behalf of our constituents. When it comes to budget implementation acts, they are vast pieces of legislation. They cover so many different areas. If any bill deserves close scrutiny, it is this type of legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688424">We have had some odd occurrences in this debate.

The Liberals used to be the most vocal opponents; they used to scream with moral outrage every time time allocation was invoked.

The fact that we have only had Friday, and now cutting it off today, I think shows an extreme disrespect.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688431">That being said, I want to move on to talk about some of the substantive measures of the bill and my views on it. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688432">The Liberals ran strongly on extolling the virtues of their middle-class tax cut. What I have to keep reminding my constituents, and indeed all Canadians is that this is not a middle-class tax cut. They will not see the full benefits unless they are earning a six-figure income. That is certainly not members of the middle class in my riding, and indeed in Canada. When the median income is $31,000 a year, those people are not receiving any benefit. Even if they had a decent income in the $60,000 to $70,000 range, their benefits would certainly not be as much as someone earning $150,000, or even up to $199,000. It is important to bring that up. The Liberals like to sell this as a middle-class tax cut, when in fact it is anything but.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688433">I also want to speak up on behalf of the hard-working small business owners in my riding of Cowichan—Malahat—Langford. They really are fantastic people. Over the last seven years, I have had a lot of opportunities to work with small businesses when they have had problems with their taxes. I was given the very privileged position, in my former life as a constituency assistant, to see the details of small business tax returns. I know how difficult it is for them to survive in today's environment. Often, small business owners are paying themselves very meagre salaries and cutting corners for themselves personally to ensure their employees have jobs and that the business continues to be a source of employment for the local community. That is a pattern that we see across Canada. Therefore, it was quite disappointing to see that the Liberals did not move ahead with their promised small business tax cut. </ParaText><ParaText id="4688434">Also, I think there was a real opportunity in the budget implementation act to take some meaningful action on credit card fees. Credit card fees can be an enormous expense for businesses. If they do not have the machines that take credit cards, they are not going to get customers, but there are huge fees for using that service. There was a missed opportunity to take some meaningful action on that measure, and it would have done some great work for businesses across the country.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4688435">The next thing I want to talk about is the child benefit, which is another program extolled by the Liberals. I would agree that it is a good thing any time we can provide families with money, because I know very well that families struggle a lot. </ParaText><ParaText id="4688436">We do not want to overextend ourselves in praising this benefit, considering the situation that many families are going through with the lack of affordable child care spaces and the maximum child benefit being around $6,400. That is only going to meet parents halfway when they are looking for child care spaces with how expensive it is. </ParaText><ParaText id="4688437">Furthermore, if there are no good full-time jobs out there with a standard living wage, then a lot of parents will not be able to afford a second job because the cost of child care completely outweighs their income. There is no chance for upward mobility, and that is the main thing. It has been proven time and again that if decent affordable child care is provided, then families will be able to make their way up. Furthermore, a strong, safe minimum wage is an added benefit.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688438">I am disappointed that families will have to wait until 2020 until the child benefit gets indexed to inflation. That leaves a big question for me: Why is the Liberal government not taking action and implementing indexation next year? I have not yet received an adequate answer to that simple question, and I will remind my constituents of that point time and again.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688439">The next part that I want to talk about goes to the infrastructure bank proposal. We first heard about this in budget 2016, earlier in the spring, when the government started talking about asset recycling. I am always wary when new terms, new technical jargon, come up. It usually means trying to change the meaning of something so people get confused about what is really going on. </ParaText><ParaText id="4688440">Andrew Coyne had this to say in one of his columns earlier this year. He stated that asset recycling “can finance capital projects like roads and bridges by charging the people who use them. Once these would have been known as user fees or road tolls; in the language of today’s technocrats, it’s called “asset monetization” or “asset recycling.”</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688441">When private investors make these substantial investments in infrastructure projects, they are going to want a good rate of return. When Michael Sabia appeared before the Toronto Region Board of Trade on March 3, 2016, he said he was looking for stable, predictable returns in the 7% to 9% range. Canadians were not acquainted with that during the Liberal campaign promise. For 7% to 9% rates of return, we would have to look at charging tolls and user fees to ordinary Canadians and residents. That goes way above and beyond the kind of interest rates that Canadians were hoping for when the federal government can use its borrowing power at extremely low interest rates to finance these kinds of capital projects. That is a far cry from the 7% to 9% that private investors are going to be looking for.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688442">Those are some of the major concerns overall. There were some incredible missed opportunities in this legislation. We in the New Democratic Party have been raising this consistently. There were some real opportunities that could have been made use of to help lower-income members of our society move forward, such as showing leadership on a federal minimum wage, providing child care spaces, and making sure the federal government uses its borrowing power to make those much-needed investments in infrastructure, rather than relying on the private sector and the tolls and user fees they are going to extract. We also hope the child benefit will be indexed to inflation starting next year.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688443">I will leave it at that because I have made my points. I appreciate this opportunity to speak on behalf of the amazing constituents of Cowichan—Malahat—Langford.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I have heard a lot of good ideas.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688455">There is more work to be done. I can that about even my own portfolio. However, I really have to share the good news. We are heading in the right direction. Is it all done yet? No, it is not. However, we have taken some major steps forward. A lot of them involve the financial stability and security of veterans. To me, that is something really near and dear to my heart.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688456">We can talk about the difference it is going to make in veterans' lives when we increase the disability award from $310,000 to $360,000, which is part of this budget, and when we increase the earnings loss benefit for injured veterans, so that instead of their getting just 75% of their pre-release salary, they will now get 90% of their pre-release salary. That will make a big difference in their lives.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688457"> There is also an upcoming change in the permanent impairment allowance. We are going to change it and call it “career impact allowance”. The eligibility criteria for the permanent impairment allowance were so narrow that hardly anyone could get access to that particular benefit. By making it a career impact allowance—and this is something that is particularly important for young veterans—if they are injured when they are very young, we will give them the financial security they would have had if they had not left the military early due to their injuries. That will make a big difference in the lives of very young veterans. That is one place where there have been significant shortfalls and gaps.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688458">There is a lot of work to do. The start that we have made is to improve the service that Veterans Affairs Canada is providing to veterans. Are we there yet? No, we are not. Opening 10 new offices is a huge step in the right direction, because it is much easier to get things done face to face than online or by telephone. We have heard again and again that a high-touch kind of system, in which people can go to talk to someone face to face instead of waiting on the telephone for a long time, makes a big difference.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688459"> It is the same when we talk about hiring new caseworkers or service agents. There was a huge backlog of cases. The service standard for Veterans Affairs was not even close to being met. Now that we are hiring new people, who are now in the middle of being trained, we will be able to deal with those disability requests a lot sooner than we had in the past. We started with this backlog. It is coming down. However, it takes time, because we need to train new people.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688460">There have been shortages at Veterans Affairs Canada over the last few years. There was a loss of 900 employees. The rest of the employees who were left behind really care about veterans. They want to make sure they are well-served. However, because there were so few of them, a lot of them ended up suffering burnout. These veterans mattered to them. However, there were so few of them and they were carrying so many cases that they could not help the veterans and they, the people who were supposed to be helping others, have ended up being injured because of the shortfall of workers at Veterans Affairs Canada.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688461">We know it is never an easy thing to change government departments and how they are structured and move forward. However, we have a wonderful group of people who really are committed to these veterans and to providing them with the kind of service they need and deserve.

Yes we are. </ParaText><ParaText id="4688463">I was out knocking on doors on Sunday, and people were telling me what a difference the Canada child benefit is making to their lives already, especially for those who do not have a large income. For example, I heard that they now have the money they need to have their son play hockey, or that they now have the money they need to get him involved instead of sitting in the basement playing with his iPad or watching television and videos.

There is huge opportunity out there, and I do believe that if the middle class is doing well, everyone will end up doing well, because it creates opportunity. It creates jobs. Did members know that here in Ontario retail sales are up by 7%? This creates jobs. It creates opportunities, because people have more money to spend. We can see the absolute evidence of that here in Ontario.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688465">If we look at our economy as a whole, investments are happening and starting to show results. Do the results happen overnight? No, they do not. They take a bit of time. However, we are now seeing that people have more money in their pockets. </ParaText><ParaText id="4688466">If the middle class is given more money, it will be spent here at home. It is going to be spent and invested here in hockey equipment, in opportunities for children, in community events, and in making their lives just a little bit better. That is what this first budget bill is about. It is about improving the lives of Canadians and knowing that if we make these targeted, strategic investments, there will be opportunities created by others. </ParaText>

While I talk about employment for veterans and others talk about employment for young people and seniors, we need to talk about employment across a broad spectrum. We need to talk in terms of innovation, job creation, and creating new jobs, the ones that we need for the future. This is what we are trying to do, not to look at things just in one particular silo, but to look across the spectrum and to create those kinds of benefits and opportunities for all Canadians. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It is a rural riding, and many people are employed in either the agricultural sector or the energy sector. In fact, my hometown of Estevan is known as the energy city. Because of this, the downturn in the oil and gas industry has been devastating, particularly in the smaller communities. </ParaText><ParaText id="4688484">There are thousands of laid off workers who are looking for employment. These men and women are wondering how they will feed their families. It is unfortunate that the government seems to be unable or unwilling to provide them with the help they so sorely need.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688485">The trickle-down effect is also happening in my riding. Small businesses, such as retail stores and restaurants, are closing their doors for good, because the customers simply are not there. It is difficult for a family to justify going out for a nice dinner when they have not received a paycheque in months. My constituents need their government to help them in their time of need, but they are seemingly being ignored. </ParaText><ParaText id="4688486">As I said, the biggest issue currently facing my riding is lack of jobs. The Conservative Party understands that jobs are created by small and medium-sized businesses. We need to support these businesses in every way we can to ensure that our economy continues to thrive in the future.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688487">There are hundreds of farms in my riding, and there are thousands of people employed in the agriculture industry. These farms are small businesses. Many are owned and operated by families that have been farming for over a hundred years. They are essential to both the cultural and economic fabric of Canada. Farmers feed the world, and Saskatchewan farmers are known for producing some of the best agricultural and agri-food products available worldwide.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688488">When the Liberals were campaigning, they promised that they would lower the small business tax to 9% from 11%. Somehow this did not seem to make it into the budget. Unfortunately, I am not shocked by this omission. The Liberals have broken promises time and time again, and the failure to lower the small business tax is no exception. </ParaText><ParaText id="4688489">Farmers in my constituency are extremely disappointed. At a time when jobs are scarce, the government is essentially telling them that they do not need the help that tax cuts would provide. It is despicable that the Liberals would mislead Canadians so blatantly, but thus far, it is what we have come to expect.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688490">The bill also increases contributions to the Canada pension plan by small businesses. Not only did the government neglect to fulfill its promise to lower the small business tax rate, but now it is making these businesses pay even more for their employees' pension plans. For a small business that employs 15 people, this is an additional $15,000 per year that an employer has to pay. That is a huge amount for a small business. It could be the difference between keeping the business open and closing it down for good. </ParaText><ParaText id="4688491">Not only did the government mislead small business owners about a reduction in the tax rate, it will also add to their financial burden by increasing the amount of CPP contributions. That is astounding.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688492"> Changes to the CPP are not helping my constituents. One gentleman from my riding has attempted to bring attention to this issue through petitions, but nothing has happened. My office wrote to the <Affiliation DbId="214313" Type="4">Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Labour</Affiliation> on his behalf, sharing his concern that an increase in the cost of medication has meant that his CPP payment does not even cover his basic necessities, like food and heat. The response from the minister's office outlined the government's plan for changes, stating that fully enhanced benefits will generally become available after about 40 years of making contributions. Not only are the Liberals refusing to make a payment increase for those in need, they are touting changes to the CPP that my constituent will not see in his lifetime.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688493">The Liberals like to talk a lot about helping the middle class. They say that they want to help those who are struggling to join it. The bill does not do that. The government has taken away measures that were making Canadians' lives easier, such as the children's fitness tax credit. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688494">I am the official opposition critic for sport, a role I am very proud of. I have seen first-hand the importance of getting children involved in sport at an early age and have witnessed the benefits that come from participation in sport. Sport improves social skills, leadership skills, and confidence and it promotes health and fitness.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4688495">However, this can get expensive, and the children's fitness tax credit was a way to ease that financial burden on parents who just want what is best for their children. Now they will not get that extra help. </ParaText><ParaText id="4688496">The Liberal plan has failed Canadians with tax hikes and red tape. This is not helping families, and it is not helping the middle class.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688497">Speaking of benefits, I must touch on the government's Canada child benefit, or CCB, which is essentially just an expensive reinvention of the wheel. Under the previous Conservative government, there were three measures put in place to help Canadian families with children: the universal child care benefit, the Canada child tax benefit, and the national child benefit supplement. Those three programs worked. They kept more money in the pockets of hard-working families, which should be the goal of any government.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688498">When the Liberals announced the Canada child benefit, they forgot one important issue, indexation. Bill <Document DbId="8519336" Type="3">C-29</Document>, the second budget implementation bill, now confirms that the government will index the Canada child benefit to inflation, beginning in 2020. According to the parliamentary budget officer, the estimated cost of indexing and enriching the CCB will cost $42.5 billion over the next five years. This is an expense the government did not budget for. Canadian families simply cannot afford another tax hike. That is exactly what will happen to pay for the current government's lack of oversight. My constituents do not need to pay more taxes, and Canadians in general do not need that either.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688499">I have spoken about jobs many times in this speech. I feel as though I need to so the Liberals can start to understand just how dire the situation is. </ParaText><ParaText id="4688500">Due to the lack of available work in the oil and gas sector, many of my constituents have had to use employment insurance. Under the previous Conservative government, reforms were made to the EI system that actually helped Canadians get back to work. The changes made EI more efficient, focused on job creation, eliminated disincentives to work, and helped to support unemployed Canadians by helping match workers with jobs. These changes are now being repealed.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688501">On this side of the House, we know that the best cure for unemployment is job creation. Employment insurance is meant to be a temporary support that helps unemployed Canadians through a difficult situation. It is not a permanent situation, which is why the changes introduced by the Conservatives were so beneficial. These people want to work. My constituents want to work. They do not want to sit at home. They want to earn their paycheques. Anything the government can do to assist in finding jobs for these people, they should be doing. Instead, the Liberals are repealing measures that were truly helpful. Again, it shows how out of touch they are with the current needs of Canadians.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688502">One way the government can create jobs is through investments in infrastructure. The Liberals say that their infrastructure will be the biggest and best that Canada has ever seen. They are spending billions of dollars, all of which needs to be paid back by the taxpayer, and most likely by our children, our grandchildren, and our great-grandchildren. Yet in my riding, there is virtually nothing to show for it. With the millions of dollars available to enhance public transit in urban areas, small rural communities and their applications for infrastructure funding are being ignored. This is unacceptable at a time when job creation should be a main focus of the government. </ParaText><ParaText id="4688503">Simply put, infrastructure projects create jobs. They need these jobs. However, it appears that the Liberals are forgetting about rural Canada once again.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688504">The record in Saskatchewan is plain to see. The Library of Parliament provided me with the figures on federal infrastructure spending in Saskatchewan over the past 20 years. From 1994 to 2005, total spending was $222.2 million under the Liberal government. From 2006 to 2015, under the previous Conservative government, total infrastructure spending in Saskatchewan was $1.256 billion. That is a huge increase in spending, and it came at a time when the province needed help. Why is it that now, when the people of Saskatchewan need their government's assistance in creating jobs, they are being left out in the cold?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688505">The budget will not balance itself. The spending by the current government will affect Canadians for generations to come. The Liberals' only solution to the problems facing Canadians seems to be to borrow and spend even more money than the budget initially set out, money that will have to be paid back by Canadian workers, families, and job creators. </ParaText><ParaText id="4688506">This bill does not help the middle class, and it certainly does not help my constituents. We need jobs. We need support. We need the Liberals to show confidence in the agriculture industry and in the oil industry. We need them to show confidence in innovation and recognize the value of carbon capture to the coal and power industry. We need it to come now.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688507"> For these reasons, I cannot support this budget.</ParaText>

With our first budget, presented in March 2016, our government took direct action to help middle-class Canadians and those who need it most. Today Canada has the lowest debt-to-GDP ratio in the G7, and our interest rates are at all-time lows. Now is the perfect time for Canada to invest in its own future success.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688528">As a mother of four children, two girls and two boys, I want to ensure they have the same opportunities, and only by investing now will we create long-term, sustainable economic growth.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688529">Strengthening the middle class will also help ensure a better quality of life for Canadians, who work hard, as well as better future opportunities for our children.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688530">By creating the right economic context for the middle class we can build a country where everyone has the opportunity to succeed. I was very proud of our commitment to help the middle class during the last election campaign.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688531">One of the first things we did as a government was implement a tax cut for the middle class and increase the tax rate by 1% for wealthier Canadians. Those changes are putting more money in the pockets of middle-class Canadians by making taxes fairer for everyone. </ParaText><ParaText id="4688532">The Canada child benefit falls under that same line of measures. Thanks to this benefit, nine out of ten families will receive more in monthly benefits, which will help lift hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty. The benefit will be indexed as of 2020. In my riding, Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, 10,300 families and 18,870 children will receive more money. Many people are very happy, contrary to what my colleague was saying. My constituents are very happy to receive the Canada child benefit.</ParaText>

However, I know that the work has just begun. In Canada and elsewhere in the world, there is a growing consensus that governments need to invest to stimulate short-term economic growth and pave the way for long-term economic growth. That is why people across the country welcomed the big investments that were announced in the November 1 economic update.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688534">The fall economic update proposed new commitments of $81.2 billion between now and 2027-28 in green infrastructure, social infrastructure, public transit, and of course transportation infrastructure that supports trade and rural and northern communities. In short, over $180 billion will be invested in community infrastructure across Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688535">We are investing today to build 21st century infrastructure because our government understands that infrastructure plays a key role in helping members of the middle class find good jobs and live in welcoming communities with clean air to breathe and clean water to drink.</ParaText>

There is work to be done on that. The pressure that the opposition delivers to us to do more and to do it faster is welcomed pressure, and anything we can do to forward this is critical.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688564">I remember in the summertime, as well, another very proud moment. I was stopped in the street by a single mom who almost broke into tears as she said “thank you”. The support through the child tax benefit had delivered her not only substantial resources with which to contend with some of the challenges in her life, but she said it gave her the first opportunity to think that she could actually save for her kid's post-secondary school.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688565">The idea that this tax benefit not only provided immediate relief, but long-term and future relief and a vision for a better tomorrow, I think is reason enough for this budget to be passed immediately. Those benefits have already started to flow to people, and I am proud of that.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688566">Another area is for single seniors. We know that women quite often are left alone without a full pension. We have moved on pension reform, but the move for the guaranteed income supplement to be boosted by 10% is lifting largely older women in this country into a better position financially so that they can take care of themselves. When their partners pass on and they are left alone, quite often their bills stay the same but their incomes change. Therefore, this is a step that we think is tremendously important, as is the CPP reform negotiated with the provinces, as is the EI reform, which is also under way and being delivered, especially to workers in Atlantic Canada and Alberta who are suffering as commodity prices turn in the wrong direction. </ParaText><ParaText id="4688567">At the end of the day, this budget is about one thing and one thing only. It is about jobs. It is about delivering economic opportunity to every corner of this country to get people back into the workforce. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688568">The phrase that we hear the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> use, “supports the middle class and those aspiring to join it”, is what this budget is all about. Nowhere is this delivered in a more pronounced way than on the issue of infrastructure, which is a program that I have a great deal of pride in. I look at this budget and see extraordinary accomplishments.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688569">I left municipal government and came to Ottawa to get exactly this kind of budget put in place, exactly this kind of support for Canada's municipalities, large and small, northern and southern, rural and urban, the whole mix. The agreements that we have with every province now mean that money is flowing to places like Alberta.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688570">Alberta had next to no infrastructure investment, because there had been no agreement between the province and the federal government for the last two years. Imagine if the two years of spending commitments announced but not delivered to municipalities were under way in Alberta. Imagine the unemployed tradespeople who would be working on infrastructure as the oil patch recovers. It could sustain that economy in a totally different way. However, instead what we had from the previous government were a lot of announcements. In the case of Prince Edward Island, the billboard was more expensive than the actual infrastructure project in Charlottetown. The Conservatives cut a lot of ribbons; they just did not cut any cheques, which was problematic for municipalities right across the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688571">The most important investment, from my perspective, is in social infrastructure, which is primarily housing. The $2.3 billion delivered for new housing in this country over the last six to eight months has been transformational in so many communities. It is supporting the most vulnerable Canadians, but, again, it is also putting people back to work, building, repairing, and sustaining our public housing stock.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688572">The biggest investments that have come to major cities are around transit. That is going to change the way that people move in our cities. It is going to allow goods and services to get to market faster, and allow people to get to work, to play, to school, and back home again, that much more effectively. It is going to change the way we generate greenhouse gases, by reducing them, by creating modal shifts as transit becomes more plentiful.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688573">On green infrastructure and flood proofing our cities, a few hundred million dollars in Calgary five or six years ago would have prevented the $600 million in flood remediation. The investments we have to make around storms of the century are fundamental, and we need those agreements put in place and delivered to cities across this country as quickly as possible.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688574">We have also stepped up for rural Canada, recognizing the needs and capacity limitations that smaller towns have in accessing government funds. We have increased the federal contribution. We have made it an easier process to get at money, and we are supporting the rural projects in the small communities that need special attention in order to become healthier and stronger places. As I said to our rural caucus chair in the Liberal Party, my job is to make their small towns bigger towns. This infrastructure money is aimed at doing exactly that.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="20">(1820)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4688575">Broadband access investment is required not just in the last mile but in the core needs of so many communities, to knit them into the modern economy, to ensure economic development opportunities and kids' ability, quite frankly, to connect to learning, to research, and to a wider world. All of these things are critical. This government has stepped up and put the dollars down, $2 billion in rural and $500 million in broadband, with more to come. Wait for next year's budget.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688576">Universities were not in our platform and nobody criticized us for it, but universities are one of the most important economic drivers in many communities across this country. The investment in construction projects, science, and research have bolstered those institutions' capacities. Again, that is part of this budget, one more reason it should be supported.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688577">The infrastructure spending is about building Canada, building strong communities and stronger families, and contributing to the GDP, the employment numbers, and the economic growth we need to succeed as a nation. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688578">Finally, I want to talk about the infrastructure bank. The infrastructure bank is a revolutionary idea for this country in terms of what possibilities exist if it is done properly. I have heard the concerns raised about public-private partnerships or joint ventures, if it makes it more palatable for my friends on the left. I have understood the risks. Of course, there are risks. There is risk in any expenditure government makes. There are risks in 100% publicly financed projects right across this country. We can check local provinces' or cities' auditor general reports to see that even publicly funded projects with no private partners go off the rails sometimes. If we are going to avoid risk, we are going to avoid infrastructure, and that is too big a risk to avoid. We have to find new ways to do it.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688579">All the hue and cry does not really tell the whole story. Only 8% of the $180 billion put down for the next decade is tied to this idea. Ninety-two per cent of the $180 billion is going to flow to traditional infrastructure programs, and not just traditional ones. There is a modification that is also critically important. For small communities, the federal input is 50%, leaving it to the province for 30:20 or 25:25 splits, which means that it is cheaper to access federal money for smaller communities. That is part of our infrastructure program.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688580">On the infrastructure bank, smaller communities can bundle projects together and move together with expertise housed in Ottawa and financed in joint ventures with public and private partnerships. There is nothing bad or irregular about that. It happens all over the country. </ParaText><ParaText id="4688581">We can also look at big Canadian projects that require financing. Instead of using municipal funds to fund big Canadian projects, like the Great Lakes seaway, which needs to be repaired as it was built with the same concrete as the Gardiner Expressway and is falling apart in the same timetable, we need major Canadian investments made and the infrastructure bank is just the vehicle to do that, to protect the traditional infrastructure money for municipalities, smaller communities, and large cities across the country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688582">We will also in-house the expertise. By in-housing the expertise, such as smaller communities that may have hockey rinks to build, which have a rate-supported funding system built in as everyone pays for ice time in this country, those sorts of projects are ideal for public-private partnerships, ideal for the kind of community development we want to do, great job creators right across this country. What will happen is that smaller communities that have those aspirations will not have to generate their own bureaucracy in order to manage joint ventures. They can lean into the infrastructure bank to both access the capital and structure the deals. This is part of what the infrastructure bank would accomplish on behalf of municipalities and communities right across the country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688583">I got criticized because I said opposition to this idea is stupid, but it does not mean that the people expressing that opposition are stupid. They just have not heard good ideas expressed about the benefits. Therefore, the criticism was not of the people, it was that the opposition idea, in and of itself, is good or bad. The reason this is such an important idea and the reason criticism is so short-sighted is that when I talked about flood protection, it is absolutely vital if we are going to preserve major metropolises and small towns. We cannot wait until the money accrues or wait to borrow, or wait to do that. We have to do it quickly. To not do it is irresponsible, to not do it is stupid.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688584">Utilizing this methodology in order to put flood protection in place is smart. If we want to do it faster, and sometimes we have to do it faster to protect cities, sometimes the borrowing costs are different, but we can figure that out with an infrastructure bank in the way that smaller cities might not be able to on their own.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688585">I will leave everyone with one last good idea. There is a guy called Mike Layton. Members might recognize the last name. There is another guy called Joe Cressy, someone I ran against. Both are New Democrats in Toronto and support public-private partnerships and toll roads in order to build infrastructure in Toronto. It is called the Don Valley Expressway and the Gardiner Expressway. The NDP is pushing this idea and I hope the party can follow the lead of some guy called Layton because—</ParaText>

It involves selling a parking lot to a pension fund from Quebec, building a new park, building new office towers, and building a new bus and GO terminal in the heart of downtown Toronto. Profits from that are being invested in the new ferry terminal. It is a joint venture, a public-private partnership. The name of that terminal is the Jack Layton ferry terminal.

The budget was in the red every year and they keep telling us without fail that they had to invest in that way because of the financial crisis in 2008.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688607">First they invested because they were told to, it was an important thing to do to stimulate the economy. It was the right thing to do at the time. One of the main reasons we fared so well in 2008 after the financial crisis in Canada was precisely because the previous Liberal government, that of Paul Martin and Jean Chrétien, refused to regulate our financial industry, which is what the Conservatives wanted and Mr. Harper got all worked up about in the House. </ParaText><ParaText id="4688608">If we had listened to the Conservatives at the time, we would have ended up much worse off than we did in Canada. We did not listen to them then, fortunately, and we are not listening to them now. Thank God, we are very careful about taking their economic advice. With the $150 billion in deficit they left us, we ended up with the worst job growth in 69 years and the worst economic growth since the Second World War. When it comes to taking lessons from my hon. colleagues across the way on managing public finances and the Canadian economy, thanks, but no thanks.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688609">One of the most important things about the budget and budget implementation Bill <Document DbId="8519336" Type="3">C-29</Document> is that they reduce inequality. When our Conservative colleagues talk about the deficit, they say that we need to think about future generations. Were they thinking about future generations when they increased the TFSA limit from $5,500 to $10,000? No. When asked that question, even the finance minister at the time, Joe Oliver, said the following:</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4688610"> “leave that to Prime Minister Stephen Harper's granddaughter to solve”. That is not our attitude.

We think that most Canadians need to benefit from wealth in this country. We think that a country where inequalities are consistently being reduced is a good thing. That is exactly why we changed those policies, including the increase in the TFSA limit. They were unfair and unjustifiable from both a moral and a tax perspective.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688613">The increase in the TFSA limit was not the only problem. There were many other tax policies put forward by the previous government that also benefited only the wealthiest 10%. Take for example income splitting.

To give an example, when I was a child, I was raised by my mother in a small Quebec City apartment with my brother. She was a single mother. We did the math this summer. That would have given us an extra $1,066 per month tax free. I can say that that would have made a big difference in our lives back then, just like this is making a big difference in the lives of thousands of Canadian families today. When I am not feeling as motivated to come here to do my job, I think about the Canada child benefit and I can say that I am very proud to defend this budget, on this side of the House, because it is lifting 300,000 children out of poverty. </ParaText><ParaText id="4688615"> I would have encouraged my colleagues, whom I salute by the way, to vote in favour of such a socially progressive and revolutionary policy for Canada, but no, they voted against it, just like they voted against the middle class tax cut that benefits 9 million Canadians across the country. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688616">They also voted against increasing the guaranteed income supplement, which helps 900,000 seniors across the country by giving them almost $1,000 more per year. That is not peanuts. When I went door to door in my riding, especially in low-income housing areas, seniors told me that their income was not keeping pace with the rising cost of living. That is exactly what we are trying to address via the guaranteed income supplement, which had not seen a significant increase in years, certainly not under the previous government. That government was more interested in the well-off, the richest 10%. That is what it did for 10 years with policies such as increasing the TFSA limit and income splitting. I am very proud that we have overturned those changes.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688617">With respect to infrastructure investment, the IMF and the World Bank concluded that austerity in times of slow growth is not good policy, so they asked all countries to invest in infrastructure to stimulate growth and innovation. That is exactly what our government is doing by investing $180 billion over the next 12 years. We believe that our unprecedented investment will address Canada's growing infrastructure deficit and stimulate the economy.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688618">Whether it is in public transit or social housing, we have some catching up to do in terms of investing in infrastructure. There is no better time to do it than when interest rates are low and the economy has slowed down. It is in fact one of the tools that Prime Minister Paul Martin used when he was minister of Finance. Back then he decided to invest in infrastructure by creating deficits. When we see growth, it is much easier to balance the budget and return to surplus.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688619"> This is what the government is banking on. The idea is to stimulate growth so we can eventually reduce the size of the debt and balance the books. That is what we are hoping for and so is everyone else. It is a target we can reach when there is growth, and for that we need to invest in innovation, science and infrastructure. This is what our government is doing.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688620">When I think of the investments we are making in science and innovation, I think about how, over the past 10 years, as the innovation train was picking up steam, Canada was stuck at the station eating dust. Université Laval is in my riding, and I meet with researchers and scientists practically every week who tell me that we are finally emerging from the little Conservative darkness. Some people would call it a great darkness. I certainly would, and so would a lot of scientists.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688621">Who could forget that Prime Minister Harper appointed a prominent creationist? That was just the tip of the iceberg. His government then adopted policies to disengage our investment in science and innovation just as European countries and the United States were making massive investments. Canada stood by and did not invest in science.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688622">With budget 2016, our government is trying to make up for lost time in science and innovation investment.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688623">That concludes my speech. I am eager to take questions from my hon. colleagues across the aisle, and I know they are also very eager to ask them. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I was only able to hear the end, so I hope my question is relevant.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688625">I have spoken with my colleague many times, and he is very professional. He is a lawyer with a large Montreal firm. However, I never thought he would be so partisan as to portray the Conservative era in such a negative light, when we gave the most substantial tax breaks in 50 years thank to 63 successive measures. We also created 1.2 million jobs after the recession. </ParaText><ParaText id="4688626">As a lawyer, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="214021" Type="2">Louis-Hébert</Affiliation> should stick to the facts. Does he not find it odd that he and his government are talking about a tax cut for the middle class, when in reality, it applies only to people who earn over $140,000 a year? A Conservative senator, Larry Smith, did some excellent research that proves it. In other words, this tax cut does not at all apply to those who need it most.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

After campaigning in the same region during the election campaign, I can assure hon. members that I definitely have no lessons to learn about partisanship from the members across the way.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688628">That being said, I can say that this tax cut will affect nine million Canadians. I thank the hon. member for giving me the opportunity to reiterate that. This tax cut will affect the $45,000 to $90,000 tax bracket. However, let us look at the budget as a whole. The Canada child benefit will lift 300,000 children out of poverty.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688629">When my colleague rises to speak, I have the following questions for him. How many people benefited from the increased TFSA limit? How many people benefited from income splitting? I can count them on one hand. How many people can my colleague name?</ParaText><ParaText id="4688630">The parliamentary budget officer did the math and answered that question.

In the last Parliament, we asked questions about the Quebec Bridge and the Conservatives showed no interest. Now all of a sudden, they are interested. I imagine it is because they got some seats back. We know how this wishful thinking works when in government. When you have a riding, you help; when you do not, you ignore it. At least that was how things were during the past four years. </ParaText><ParaText id="4688633">The issue is still unresolved, even though it attracted some attention in the Quebec City area during the last election campaign, as I understand it. With respect to the infrastructure bank, is the member at all concerned that privatization will be one of the proposed solutions along with the negative effects that this would have on the Quebec City area and its residents?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

This gives me the opportunity to highlight the positions of the various parties during the last election campaign.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688635"> We know that for 10 years the Conservatives hid behind the courts regarding the Quebec Bridge. When Stephen Harper came to Quebec City, he jokingly asked if the Quebec Bridge was still standing. I can say that it is very important for us to find a solution for the Quebec Bridge.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688636"> Meanwhile, the NDP had another position, which was to impose special legislation in an attempt to force CN to paint the bridge. However, for years CN has been winning in the courts, saying that it has no aesthetic obligation. This would mean once again going back to court.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688637">On this side of the House, we are prepared to put $75 million on the table. We are in discussions with various stakeholders in the Quebec City area, including CN, the provincial government, the municipal government, the chamber of commerce, and Laval University. We did not see as much progress on this file over the past 10 years as we are seeing right now under a Liberal government, with only two Liberal MPs in the Quebec City area working as a team. We have five or seven Conservatives who are issuing fine press releases, holding press conferences, and getting all worked up about anything and everything every week, yet they never do anything constructive.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Dumping drives down the price of steel and is having a significant impact on Canada's steel industry and the thousands of workers it employs.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688710">My riding of <Affiliation DbId="214139" Type="2">Essex</Affiliation> is home to a world-class steel plant, Atlas Tube, which produces top-quality Canadian products, while providing good family-sustaining jobs in our Harrow community. In fact, the steel industry employs 22,000 working-class Canadians in steel production and an additional 100,000 Canadians indirectly. Steel accounts for $2.6 billion a year in GDP.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688711">The NDP echoes the calls of industry and labour groups for a modernized trade remedy system that effectively addresses issues like steel dumping.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688712">The Canadian Chamber of Commerce and local chambers like mine in Windsor—Essex have urged the federal government to act by passing resolutions in support of ending unfair steel dumping. The United Steelworkers have also been actively urging the government to act.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688713">In October, the Standing Committee on International Trade adopted my motion to study this important issue. I am very much looking forward to this study resuming in the New Year. Action is urgently needed.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688714">Canada has fallen behind in our sanctions, making us an easy target for dumping.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688715">On the other hand, countries like Australia have strengthened their trade remedies. </ParaText><ParaText id="4688716">By not having our sanctions in line with other similar economies, Canada risks inviting even more dumping in the future. We need improved data collection, better transparency, more robust and frequent analyses of foreign subsidies, stiffer penalties, and improved legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688717">Canadian steel has been the backbone of Canadian infrastructure projects for decades. Our plants have an excellent reputation for producing high-quality steel products, while upholding strong labour and environmental standards.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688718">The government's planned investments in infrastructure should represent a big opportunity for Canada's steel industry, but it may not be able to capitalize if Canada continues to allow cheap imports from China to undercut our producers.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688719"> Barry Zekelman, CEO of Atlas Tube, has said, “Think of the consequences of our infrastructure, our factories, and our defence all relying on foreign-made steel if our industry shuts its doors.”</ParaText><ParaText id="4688720">Every day that Canada does not act, our steel industry is losing money and jobs.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688721">There is another serious issue that we have yet to address in this House. We know that the Liberal government is talking to China about a potential FTA. However, there is a foundational issue with this relationship that needs to be addressed in a timely manner. Canada currently treats China as a non-market economy, but we know China is pushing to be granted market economy status. Canada is going to have to make a decision.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688722">I can tell members that Canada's steel industry is very concerned about the implications of granting China this new status. It will make it more difficult to address trade issues like dumping.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688723">The Canadian Steel Producers Association has estimated that granting China market economy status would result in the loss of 60,000 highly skilled middle-class jobs, a permanent reduction in GDP of over $9 billion in the short term, $7.6 billion over the long term, and significant reductions in federal and provincial government revenues.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688724">I would like to ask the parliamentary secretary, what concrete measures will the government take to tackle the very worrisome issue of unfair steel dumping by China; and are the Liberals considering granting China market economy status?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Algoma Steel was around then, as was Atlas Steels in Welland. They no longer exist by those names.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688728">Steel production is a major economic activity in Canada. In 2015, the sector had nearly 17,000 Canadian jobs, generated $11 billion in revenue, and accounted for $2.6 billion of Canada's GDP. Canadian steel mills make a significant contribution to local economies, but they are also part of the North American integrated supply chain.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688729">The government is determined to support this industry and ensure its viability using a number of tools. </ParaText><ParaText id="4688730">One of those tools, a strong trade remedy system to prevent unfairly undervalued or subsidized products from entering the Canadian market, is essential. The system enables Canada's industry to compete with others on a level playing field and attract investment in North America. Canada has implemented trade measures for 12 steel products in order to protect our producers.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688731">The government responded to the administrative and legislative proposals made by the steel industry to enhance Canada's trade remedy system. Two proposals were implemented in the budget implementation act and others were subject to consultations, which were completed on June 29. The government is currently analyzing the requests that came out of those consultations. What is more, the Standing Committee on International Trade is committed to conducting a study on the steel industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688732">On an international level, the issue of global overcapacity was discussed during the G20 summit in Hangzhou on September 4 and 5. As part of that event, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and other leaders recognized the problem of overcapacity in the steel industry. This acknowledgement was an important step since China, the world's leading steel producer, agreed to work on increasing its efforts on exchanging information and co-operation. In light of the leaders summit, the G20 countries and the OECD are making efforts to establish a global forum on steel overcapacity. The <Affiliation DbId="214326" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation> is following this file closely, because she is aware of the need to take action quickly regarding this problem. Preparations for the first meeting are going well and Canada will attend.</ParaText>

To be aware of the issue and not act is cold comfort to the steel producers in Canada and those who work in this important sector. We will lose jobs if we do not act. It is good to hear that the government understands the issue, but without action we are not going to be able to ensure that these jobs are going to stay safe inside of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688735">Supporting this industry must include the important consideration that I mentioned, and that is whether Canada will grant China market economy status. This decision is coming up on December 11. It is very pressing, and it is urgent for the steel producers to understand what they will be facing if the government makes the decision to give that granting to China.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688736">Again, can the parliamentary secretary outline when his government will implement changes to Canada's trade remedy system, and how will the government deal with China's request to be granted market economy status?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

People are speaking out. Many people have talked to me about this, including individuals from my own riding of Laurier—Sainte-Marie, which I am proud to represent, as well as members of national organizations.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688741">As part of this process, many well-known organizations, and some that have even been recognized for their work with an especially vulnerable population, have had their funding taken away. Many will have to either eliminate large portions of their activities, or in some cases, shut down altogether.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688742">The process in question is riddled with problems. First of all, we are told that the funding has not changed. Theoretically, that is true, except that by lumping all networks related to HIV and hepatitis C together with all other sexually transmitted diseases, this ultimately reduces the funds available to each network. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688743">What is more, even if that were not the case, we are still being told that the funding has not changed. That is also a problem because the funding has not changed for years and has basically been frozen. Rent, wages, and all the rest have continued to increase during that time, which means that, in reality, people have to do more with fewer resources. We are talking about community organizations, not organizations that have access to jet planes and limousines. There are many community organizations in my riding of Laurier—Sainte-Marie, and they are already working extremely hard with very limited resources.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688744">There is also a problem with the process. Funding criteria used to be public, but not this year. Yes, consultations were held. What the organizations are telling me is that the consultations were all over the map. I guess that is what this government likes to call a conversation. The organizations also told me that the consultations did not produce any tangible results. Afterward, the organizations were left in the dark, until, all of a sudden, they were given the bad news.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688745">Speaking of consultations, it is interesting to note that consultations were held to discuss the priorities and objectives of the Public Health Agency of Canada, yet the decisions that were made do not correspond with those priorities. As I was saying, there are well-established organizations that are known for their work that had their funding drastically reduced.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688746">Many of these organizations have been working on the ground for about thirty years. The government is suddenly, without warning dismantling an entire network. I see this happening and, of course, I feel bad for the organizations, but mostly I worry about the people they serve. When the government reduces or eliminates funding for organizations, it is the people that those organizations help—</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Canada has made great progress in addressing HIV and hepatitis C over more than three decades of responding to these epidemics. However, there is still work to do.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688751"> As members may know, Canada has committed to meeting the global UNAIDS 90-90-90 HIV targets by 2020, meaning that 90% of HIV-positive people know their status, that 90% of people who know their status receive treatment, and that 90% of those on treatment have suppressed viral loads.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688752">The Government of Canada continues to work closely with the provinces and territories, community organizations, and scientific and medical communities to reach the 90-90-90 targets and those for viral hepatitis by engaging with communities to strengthen prevention and access to testing and treatment services, by enhancing surveillance to monitor progress, and by providing screening and testing guidance to help professionals.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688753">As part of these broader efforts to address HIV and hepatitis C, the Public Health Agency of Canada recently announced its decision related to funding of community-based organization projects under its new HIV and hepatitis C community action fund.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688754">The development and implementation of the fund has been a significant but necessary undertaking to refocus our efforts in preventing and controlling HIV and hepatitis C. These funding decisions followed an open and competitive solicitation based on priorities set in collaboration with provinces and territories, community-based organizations, people living with HIV or hepatitis C, and other stakeholders and partners.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688755">I would like to reiterate that the funding our government provides to community-based organizations has not diminished. It remains steady at $26.4 million annually and continues to support time-limited projects across Canada. While 124 organizations were successful in the application process for the community action fund, including 41 new organizations, others were not. These included some organizations that had been funded previously under the program. For some of these organizations, the loss of project funding for the next year was disappointing. For others, this represents the loss of an important source of funding, which could impact the sustainability of the organizations and their work.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688756">Our government has heard the concerns of these organizations, and in an effort to help those organizations through the transition, PHAC has been directed to provide up to one year of transitional project funding on a case-by-case basis, which would end on March 31, 2018.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4688757">PHAC will work closely with each organization to determine the funding amount that will be provided and the work that can be achieved over one year. Furthermore, PHAC is working with organizations that were approved at lower amounts than previously, in comparison to the current funding, to help them transition as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688758"> The fund is designed to ensure that funding supports areas where there is the greatest burden based on current rates of HIV and hepatitis C.</ParaText><ParaText id="4688759"> We still have a lot more to do if we are going to stop the spread of these serious but preventable diseases. That is why it is important that we continue to work hand in hand with provinces and territories, as well as with stakeholder partners and people living with HIV and hepatitis C, to have the greatest impact possible.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
