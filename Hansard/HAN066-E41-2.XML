I am certainly proud to rise today on the issue of the abuse of the public trust in taxpayers with the misuse of government resources, particularly the use of the Challenger jet.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632269">Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="170119" Type="2">Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier</Affiliation>. </ParaText><ParaText id="3632270">This issue needs to be debated in the House because we see within the government the continual and deliberate blurring of the lines between the use of government resources that are meant to serve the people of Canada and the partisan narrow interests of the Conservative war machine. Whether it is the misuse of government resources or the redrawing of the websites, everything the government seems to be doing is taking public resources and turning them to the personal use of the party or its friends. That is something the Conservatives used to rail against in the old Liberal regime. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632271">Very clear rules about the use of flights were set up by the Board of Internal Economy. For members of Parliament who do have to charter planes into isolated regions—for example, I have had to charter flights up into James Bay—there are clear rules. Number one is, we have to ensure that the only people on those planes actually are government staff. Anyone else on the plane would have to be put on the flight manifest and would have to pay the full charge. The Board of Internal Economy is very clear on this, so when we find out that a guy who raised $3.5 million for the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> gets to fly back and forth from Calgary, that is simply not acceptable. That is an abuse of trust.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632272">I would like to read a few quotes that will put this into context: </ParaText><ParaText id="3632273"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">We have seen the Prime Minister flying around the country on Challenger jets doing a few hours of government work, then spending the rest of the time campaigning and fundraising…. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. The…culture of entitlement goes on. The public must be given a chance to put an end to it.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632274">Who said that? It was our present <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> when he was in opposition. Yes, meet the new boss; same as the old boss over there. The issue here is that this is a government that is telling the rest of Canadians that the cupboard is bare and yet the Prime Minister can fly one of his buddies down to watch the New York Yankees at a ball game, where the Challenger jet cost taxpayers anywhere between $8,000 and $11,000 an hour to run. When the government is telling senior citizens in my riding that the cupboard is bare, while it is flying its friends to ball games, I would ask the Canadian people if they think that is fair. </ParaText><ParaText id="3632275">A number of people have spoken out on this issue. I would like to quote them now: </ParaText><ParaText id="3632276"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Mr. Speaker, while Canadians are barely coping with higher gasoline prices, the…ministers do not share such mundane concerns. They prefer going from Ottawa to Toronto aboard a luxury jet that costs $11,000 an hour to operate…. How can the Prime Minister justify such a waste of public funds?</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3632277">Who said that? It was the present <Affiliation DbId="194774" Type="96">Minister of Employment and Social Development</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632278">There are a few others: </ParaText><ParaText id="3632279"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Mr. Speaker, if $1 million on airfare were not enough, it turns out, through access to information, that of the 141 flights taken on the Challenger jet between January and July, over $71,000 was spent on food. That does not include the bar bill. That represents an average of $508 per flight, just less than the monthly grocery bill for a Nova Scotia family of four. How does the Prime Minister justify spending the equivalent of the cost of a monthly family grocery bill on an air flight? Just what was on that menu?</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3632280">Who said that? It was the present <Affiliation DbId="194629" Type="4">Minister of Justice.</Affiliation> We all remember him when he was minister of defence. He is the man who ordered a search and rescue helicopter to pick him up from his hunting camp because he was too lazy to come out on his own. He used our military government resources to fly him from his hunting camp. </ParaText><ParaText id="3632281">
								<B>Mr. Robert Chisholm:</B> He had to get to dinner though.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632282"><B>Mr. Charlie Angus:</B> Mr, Speaker, oh, he had to get to dinner, yes. He had the lobster dinner he had to go to. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3632283">Here is the man who is the Minister of National Defence, using taxpayers’ resources to go to court to tell veterans of our country that this government has no obligation to them. If we asked any Canadian on the street what they think of our obligation to veterans, they would say that it is shameful that the Conservatives are using taxpayers' dollars to argue that they have no social contract with veterans. </ParaText><ParaText id="3632284">Yet the <Affiliation DbId="194629" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> had a total social contract with the military when he needed to be picked up from hunting camp to be flown to his lobster dinner. This is the kind of abuse that Canadians-—</ParaText><ParaText id="3632285"><B>Mr. Robert Chisholm:</B> Got any more?</ParaText><ParaText id="3632286"><B>Mr. Charlie Angus:</B> We have got lots of them, Mr. Speaker. I have been holding this one back, because it comes from one of the most quotable and most ridiculous members of Parliament that have ever sat in this House in the last 150 years.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632287">…the minister has been at his post for five years…. The Sea Kings are no closer to being replaced.… Instead there are Challenger jets to fly the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his cabinet around in luxury. </ParaText><ParaText id="3632288">Who said that? Think, folks. It was the member for <Affiliation DbId="170305" Type="2">Calgary West</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632289">We are having fun with this, but this is not a funny issue. This is about a contempt for the Canadian people. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> told Canadians in 2006 that he would clean up this culture of entitlement. Instead, his attitude was that he would clean up the Liberals, and once they were done, then he and his friends would pork out at the trough.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632290">That is not what Canadians voted for. This is not about saying that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his family should not use the Challenger for security reasons, although I note that the present <Affiliation DbId="194622" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> said:</ParaText><ParaText id="3632291"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">There is something else the government can do. If the government wants to show confidence in the commercial airline industry, here is a suggestion. Will the Prime Minister park his Challenger jet and fly commercial skies as other Canadians do as a sign of faith that security works?</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3632292">That is what the present <Affiliation DbId="194622" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> said when he was in opposition. He wanted the Liberal Prime Minister to fly commercial air, but he has not said that in cabinet because they enjoy the perks.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632293">Again, this is abuse of the public trust from a government that said it would do something better. The Conservatives are doing it at a time when they are telling senior citizens that the cupboard is bare; when they are telling veterans who served our country, “Hey, buzz off, we are done with you, and we will go to court to fight you”; when they are telling first nations children in the north, “You do not deserve schools because we cannot afford them”. However, when it comes to looking after their pals, there is all the money in the world.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632294">Speaking of which, I go back to the <Affiliation DbId="194629" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> and his complaint about the cost of food. He wanted to know how they could justify wasting that much money on a flight. Yet we just found out that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> spent $32,000 feeding his hand-picked crew who went to Israel. That was $150 per meal, and if we look at what they were serving, oh, man, those sandwiches looked pretty brutal. If they are going to blow money like that, at least they could serve people well.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632295">We Canadians expect better from this <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and we are not getting it. That is why we brought this forward, and we are doing it in a non-partisan manner. This is what the Conservative Party stood for. We are asking Conservatives to return to their roots. Perhaps they have forgotten where they came from. Perhaps they have forgotten how they used to be offended by the use of taxpayers' dollars to help friends, insiders, and buddies.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632296">This is a moment where we reach out across the aisle to our poor, wayward, lost children of the Conservative Party and try to bring them back into the fold of accountability and say, “This is just one little way of doing this”.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632297"><B>Mr. Robert Chisholm:</B> We could rehabilitate them.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632298"><B>Mr. Charlie Angus:</B> We can rehabilitate them, Mr. Speaker. I do not know if we could rehabilitate all of them, but we are willing to try. That just shows the kind of people we have on our side; that we believe that people can be reformed, even the old Reformers, who have certainly given up on their sense of accountability.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632299">We are asking for all-party support on this. We are not saying the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> cannot fly the Challenger. We are not saying his family cannot fly on it, but people like bagmen and buddies have no business getting free and cheap flights on the taxpayers' dime. Let us have some rules. Let us follow the rules. Canadians follow the rules. It is time the government followed the rules.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The reason I am having a difficult time with that is because we need to appreciate what the leader of the New Democratic Party has been up to lately.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632301">We can talk about the millions of tax dollars that have been abused through the direct mail that has gone out. We can talk about the outreach office. The outreach office is supposed to be in Saskatchewan where the NDP does not have any members of Parliament, and it is there to service constituents.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632302">The NDP does not have any right to give lectures regarding the issue of public trust. It has done a disservice to public trust. Remember how it had to be dragged kicking and screaming on proactive disclosure because it did not want to tell Canadians where it was flying and the prices it was charging? It had to be dragged, kicking and screaming on this issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632303">Why does the member feel that the NDP has to have an outreach office in Saskatchewan and have the taxpayers pay for that, as opposed to its own political party that should be footing the bill?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

This is the party that invented it. My colleague is jumping up and down like an angry man. I am not surprised. I have certainly touched a chord with the Liberals.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632305">The member has the gall to refer to mailings and to Bourassa, when Elections Canada has ruled that we did everything perfectly legally. That is different from what happened with the Liberals. It was a government that was corrupt from the beginning. It is as corrupt now. The Liberals are certainly angry.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632306">When their new leader came in, they were going to do politics differently. All they have done in terms of their politics is continually attack the New Democrats for the fact that we stand up for regions, that we go to the House of Commons and talk with them about what is legal and how to do things right so that we can represent people. At the same time, the new Liberal leader is off selling Keystone XL for the oil lobby. We talk to average Canadians; he talks to oil lobbyists. </ParaText><ParaText id="3632307">I know that the member is angry. He is an angry old man, but that is because his party has been relegated to the wilderness for its contempt of the Canadian people.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I may need a few breaks. </ParaText><ParaText id="3632321">I am pleased to join the debate on the motion before us today. Considering the commotion it is causing in the House, we seem to have touched a sensitive spot that needs to be explored. I am pleased to have the opportunity to do so. It can be hard to have to speak following my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170184" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation>, who is always so eloquent and who was able to present various examples of abuse of power by the other two parties, but I will do my best. He already gave all the best quotations, but it would be worth hearing them in both languages. This is an important moment for my colleagues from Quebec. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632322">Even though I have the opportunity to rise in the House to discuss the motion before us, I am disappointed because the motion speaks to something so obvious and so logical that I do not understand why we are even talking about it today.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632323">When the Conservatives were in opposition, they complained about this type of abuse of public trust and public money. Still today they are trying to pass themselves off as great defenders of the use of public money. They ask Canadians to trust them with their money and to give them the responsibility to run the country. They say that they will not be like the Liberals, they will not betray Canadians and they will use the money wisely. If the Conservative Party had truly adhered to that principle, we would not be here today talking about this and instead might be discussing things that Canadians are interested in and concerned about.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632324">My colleague was talking about the cuts to veterans' services. CFB Valcartier is in my riding of Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier. That base sent an incredible number of soldiers to the front lines in Afghanistan. I have had the opportunity to welcome a number of them home since being elected. Every time, it is an unsettling and difficult experience for me. I am 28 and I see people younger than I am returning from Afghanistan, where they experienced things I cannot even begin to imagine. They need help from our government, but our government tells them that it has to balance the budget by 2015, in time for the election. The government tells them that they will have to wait a while because it does not have a social contract with them. That is a matter for another speech. It is terrible to say such a thing. It is even worse to try to use such a defence to create a legal precedent.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632325">I am straying somewhat from what we are debating, but I am using this example to illustrate the Conservatives' bad faith towards those truly in need. There have been more than 10 cases of suicide among soldiers who needed help. According to the DND ombudsman's most recent report, we need 15% to 20% more mental health care professionals.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632326">Just recently, we heard that our francophone soldiers in Afghanistan had to obtain psychological services from the U.S. forces. DND did not even have the decency to provide them with services in their official language. We are told that it is not possible to deploy psychologists and other professionals. That shows a poor understanding of national defence. That is the argument that I heard and I could not believe it. </ParaText><ParaText id="3632327">The U.S. can deploy psychologists and provide essential services to their troops. DND says that there was a problem, that it was not an ideal solution and that there might be a cultural or language shock, but that it would eventually resolve this situation when it has the time to consider it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632328">Such terrible things are being said. Then the government tells us that it supports our troops, but that we all have to tighten our belts. It says that everyone has funding problems and that everyone has to make sacrifices. Everyone has to tighten their belts, except for the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s cronies. That is another class of Canadians, the pampered elite. Personally, I do not get to pay the equivalent of economy class for flights worth $11,000. That never happens. I cannot afford that kind of luxury even with all the Aeroplan points I collect because I travel a lot.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3632329">It is a whole different story for people who raise over $3 million for the Prime Minister's election campaigns. Those people can travel on the Challenger. They are spoiled and can go wherever they want at very affordable prices. I should spend more time talking to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> so that maybe I too can enjoy these privileges. I would like to experience that luxury sometime. I find the whole thing mind-boggling. There are no other words to describe how I feel about this situation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632330">I am going to follow my colleague's example and give some quotations. I find them delightful. Here is one that we have not heard yet today. I will start with the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. At the time, he was an entrepreneur. He has worked hard in his life, and he understands the issues facing the middle class, people who do not have very much money. At the time, he and his wife owned a small business. He said:</ParaText><ParaText id="3632331"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">My wife, Laureen, and I ran our own small businesses. We had to pay our own health care premiums. We had to purchase our own supplemental health care coverage, like most people in the country. We cannot afford to fly to clinics in the United States to get health care when things go wrong and we certainly cannot afford to get on Challenger jets to do it. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632332">He said that on October 1, 2005. Much has changed since then. Apparently, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> can now afford to travel all over the country for various reasons. If I am not mistaken, he travels to many different places, not only in Canada but also abroad. That is a problem. In the quote that I just read, the Prime Minister was trying to show Canadians that he truly understands the problems of the middle class and that he is there to listen to them and to ensure that their money is spent wisely. However, now that the Conservatives have a majority, it is too late to go back. We are stuck with them until the next election. We are stuck with people who regularly betray our trust.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632333">I feel shortchanged, and so do the voters in my riding. People voted for the Conservatives because they hoped to see something new. The Conservatives played the game right, and many people put their trust in them. I can understand that. Unfortunately, people very quickly became disillusioned.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632334">It is rare to see people looking forward to another election. People are realizing that a lot of money is being spent and a lot of time and energy is being wasted. People want their elected officials, their members of Parliament, to work for them, to represent them in the House and to be genuinely deserving of their trust. When I visit my riding now, people ask me when the next election will be so that they can toss this government out. The Conservatives have told them so many half-truths and have regularly shaken their confidence.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632335">Voters do not want an election so they can bring back the Liberals. On the contrary, my constituents want something new. They have not heard any policies from the current third party. I am still waiting. I would like to be able to debate policy, since that is my job. I was sent here by taxpayers and Canadian citizens to debate issues, present ideas and try to put forward solutions to make Canada a better country. I am still waiting for proposals from the Liberals to give me a little something to debate. I imagine that we will see something in 2015, which is still a ways away.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632336">Regardless, people are looking forward to a change and to getting the government they deserve: a New Democrat government that will defend their interests and ensure that the taxes it collects—because taxes will have to be collected, as they are now—will be used properly to provide services to the public. Furthermore, a New Democrat government will not use public funds to help Conservative friends and backers live in the lap of luxury. That is completely unacceptable. We saw that under the Liberals, and it is still going on under the Conservatives. In 2015 it will be time for a change, time to elect a New Democrat government.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

							<ParaText id="3632358">We require capabilities that guarantee we can rapidly reach every corner of our territory, from coast to coast to coast. This is precisely what these aircraft are bringing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632359">The dedicated VIP transport aircraft are operated by two squadrons, 437 Transport Squadron at CFB Trenton and 412 Transport Squadron here in Ottawa. Both these squadrons have a proud and storied history originating in the Second World War. The history of the 437 squadron goes back to 1944, providing crucial transportation in Europe.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632360"> Today it operates the Airbus A310-300s, all designated as CC-150 Polaris aircraft. Only one of these, number 001, is operated in what one might call a true VIP configuration, and for good reason. It has been used by Her Majesty the Queen and other members of the royal family. The other four Polaris are configured as normal aircraft with cargo transport capabilities and air refuelling capability.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632361">The 412 squadron can trace its origins back to the Battle of Britain and D-Day. It was the squadron of John Gillespie Magee, Jr., the RCAF pilot who wrote the poignant and memorable poem <I>High Flight</I> only months before his death in 1941.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632362">The 412 squadron operates the CC-144 aircraft, the Bombardier Challenger business jets, in a VIP configuration from Ottawa's Macdonald–Cartier International Airport. These aircraft are twin engine, long-range executive jets, offering rapid air transportation up to 5,930 kilometres and a maximum speed of about 1,000 kilometres per hour. The Challengers can quickly deliver passengers almost anywhere in the world and can be used in a medical evacuation role when required.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632363">It is important to understand that these aircraft are not sitting idle at a terminal just waiting for an urgent call to ferry a minister to a meeting. These are working aircraft undertaking either training or other military work. For example, the 437 squadron used its Polaris air-to-air refueling capabilities to support CF-18 fighters in operations over Libya. The Polaris were also used to ferry Canadian troops back and forth from Afghanistan.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632364">It is important to realize that there are strict rules in place for how these capabilities are used. Most fundamentally, for security reasons, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> cannot use commercial aircraft. We all understand that and we all appreciate it. Canadians would be somewhat concerned to see the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> flying on a commercial jet because of the public safety issues that surround him.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632365">In addition, the use of the fleet is strictly governed by Treasury Board guidelines. Government administrative aircraft are only to be used for government purposes and government business when, first, the flight is being made to a point where there is no commercial air service, when no space is available on a commercial air service, or when because of difficulties in routings or time tables substantial savings of essential time can be made by using administrative aircraft in place of commercial aircraft.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632366">The second instance is when official parties of some size need to travel together and significant advantage can be gained by using a government aircraft. The third is where security considerations render commercial travel impractical.

							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3632367">The guidelines are quite clear.

Again, I want to remind members that when the Prime Minister uses government aircraft, the RCMP is first of all responsible for the safety and security of the Prime Minister, and its advice is that he should not travel on commercial flights.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632370">As a standard practice, when the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> uses the Challenger to travel on Conservative Party business, the party reimburses the government the cost of an equivalent commercial flight.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632371">Finally, we have reduced the cost of ministerial travel on government aircraft by nearly 75%, compared to when the Liberals held office.</ParaText>

The motion raises very serious concerns about the proper use of government resources and government funds, and it raises questions about accountability.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632426">First, to the movers of the motion, I have heard some members of the NDP talk about how they are vigilant in the public interest and public matters and issues that are important to Canadians, yet today we are dealing with this motion. I do not think that this is at the top of Canadians' list of important issues to be dealt with.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632427">This is the same NDP that is now before the PROC committee to discuss its leader's actions in opening an office in Saskatchewan, where there are no NDP members. If we look at the job description, we see that it talks about assisting members of Parliament through outreach to their constituents so as to best represent them, but the NDP does not have any constituents there. The telling tale in the job description is under the qualifications, which ask for experience in election campaigns. It is clearly a breach of government resources and House of Commons resources to open up an office to carry out partisan activities. That is coming from the NDP.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632428">Let me come back to this issue. Yes, we must hold the government to account. We need to know who flew on the taxpayer's dime and whether those costs were reimbursed in the appropriate manner. These are important issues to bring forward.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632429">Let us be crystal clear that we also understand that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> cannot travel on a commercial aircraft. Any time that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> must travel, for whatever reason, he must travel under the protection of the Department of National Defence. Most Canadians and most parliamentarians understand and respect that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632430"> However, the use of government aircraft for party business is a broader pattern of public resources being used for Conservative partisan purposes. It goes well beyond shuttling top Conservatives to partisan events. We will look at some of the examples.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632431">Let us look at government advertising. This includes tens of thousands, even hundreds of millions, spent on high-cost, low-information government advertising, such as advertising the government's action plan. These advertisements are clearly meant to sway Canadians toward the opinion of the Conservative Party and are not government advertising.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632432">It also includes over a quarter million, and still counting, to send out press releases. It goes on to talk about the government's websites. The government has just completely overhauled its websites and has moved away from providing information and toward more partisan advertising for the government.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632433">We can then look at the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s new 24 Seven website, which shows the farcical videos launched by the Prime Minister's Office. There are four staffers spending their time and using government-owned equipment to create these videos of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and senior Conservatives to promote nothing other than themselves and the Conservative Party. Many of these videos have had only a dozen hits. This is not a very good use of taxpayers' dollars.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632434">To come back to the use of government resources to shuttle around cabinet ministers, we still have the former Minister of National Defence being airlifted by a search and rescue helicopter out of a fishing trip that he was on. This just goes to show the very poor planning of the government on this particular issue. The minister knew well in advance that he had a meeting and a press conference that had been planned for weeks on that particular day. He could have altered his schedule somewhat, but no, he decided to call in the resources of the Canadian military to airlift him out of a fishing camp.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632435">Let us get back to the use of overseas travel and using these government aircraft to ferry delegations around the country and around the world. It is an important task. We have to be represented in the world and we have to provide transportation to these delegations. The problem is that a lot of these delegations do not truly cross partisan lines.</ParaText>

However, we have seen more and more often that they are only using it for their own Conservative MPs and their buddies. One only needs to look down the passenger list of some of these delegations to see that they are all well-connected Conservatives, including donors and fundraisers. It shows a partisan face to the world when this is done.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632437">To summarize, yes, Liberals are very concerned about the proper use of government aircraft, and we should be vigilant about it. If these uses cross the line, it is only right that the governing party reimburse Canadians fully and fairly for the expenses at fair market value. Unfortunately, we keep seeing many examples of the Conservatives harnessing public resources for clearly partisan ends. The use of government aircraft for Tory officials only came to light through access to information. That leads to the question of what else might be going on that has not yet come to light. </ParaText><ParaText id="3632438">Where is the total respect for taxpayers' dollars?

							<ParaText id="3632516">The issue we have brought before the House is a very important one. We are talking about the proper, reasoned and intelligent use of public money. The Conservative Party's discount travel system is a very popular concept in the private sector.

I raised the example of Senator Duffy because, like Mark Kihn, he is a major fundraiser. In Senator Duffy's case, he was able to put on a good show. He raised millions of dollars by making thousands of people laugh at Conservative Party events. In both cases, these men were given preferential treatment.

The only thing I do understand is that the Prime Minister apparently continues to keep his caucus in a yoke of ironclad discipline, unless he is in a really tough spot, as he was with former Conservative Party executive director Dimitri Soudas, who really went too far.

Taken in isolation, what we are debating right now in the House is a mistake that we could consider excusing if the Conservatives would acknowledge their mistakes or their lack of judgment. However, when we look at the big picture, we can point to the in and out scandal of the 2006 election; the robocalls to mislead voters and send them to polling stations that did not exist; all the Senate scandals; not to mention the problems of the Minister of International Cooperation, who had a great deal of difficulty deciding where to put his lunch box and sleeping bag on certain outings to the Quebec cottages of prominent Canadians; and of course we could mention the former minister of international cooperation, Bev Oda, who threw tantrums in order to be able to smoke in her room and treated herself to $16 glasses of orange juice. </ParaText>

The motion is not attempting to prevent the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> from using the Challenger aircraft for security reasons, although some have suggested that it is. The opposition seems to recognize the security needs established by the RCMP for him to travel in this manner. The motion is also not about the fact that the NDP is using House resources to open a political office in Saskatchewan, a point that has often been raised in this discussion today. What the motion proposes to do is to restrict who can travel on the Challenger with the Prime Minister.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632573">I did some research on the use of government aircraft like the Challenger. Our government has reduced the cost of ministerial travel on government aircraft by nearly 75% compared to when the Liberals held office.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632574"> From a Treasury Board perspective, I can remind this House that in budget 2009, we announced a spending freeze by all departments on travel, hospitality, and conference expenditures. Then, in 2010, we froze these expenditures at 2008-09 levels for two additional years. In 2011, we announced a new directive on the management of expenditures on travel, hospitality, and conferences to replace the existing hospitality policy. Each year, departments have to publish their total annual expenditures for travel, hospitality, and conferences, including an explanation of the main variances from the previous year's expenditures.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632575"> In economic action plan 2012, we committed to modernizing and reducing the back office, and identified ways of reducing travel expenses by using online tools, such tele-conferencing, video-conferencing, and virtual presence.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632576">In economic action plan 2013, we implemented measures to cut departmental travel spending by over $42 million, or about 5%.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632577">In all, between 2008-09, the base year for the travel cap, and 2011-12, government-wide travel expenditures went down by over $240 million.

These efforts have been part of our government's overall effort to save taxpayers' money.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632578">However, getting back to the opposition motion, the motion is not intended to save taxpayers' money, as few opposition motions ever are.

However, there have been a lot of comments that are really off the topic. We have a very simple proposition before the House that the official opposition brought forward, which I gather the other parties do not want to support. I want to read it into the record to bring us back to the issue.

							<ParaText id="3632604">It is not about security of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> or the need for him to have security. It is not about whether the Prime Minister should have a plane. It is not even about whether his family should be on the plane with him, and it is not about people having access to the plane to do government business, so let us clear that all up because some people have been wandering off and making comments as though we had challenged that premise. </ParaText><ParaText id="3632605">The facts are those. The motion I read in is what the discussion is about, or should be about. Sadly, it has gone off in other directions. That is the choice of members, but I just want to bring it back for Canadians because this is about trying to bring back accountability to this place and to government.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632606">My mother was mayor of Ottawa for a while and she had a driver. Most people who knew my mother knew she was a terrific person, a great mother and not a bad mayor, but she was not a great driver, so many people were happy with that. However, the purpose of her having a driver was for her to be able to do her business and to make sure that she was able to do her business on behalf of the citizens of Ottawa. It was not a fancy car, just a basic car, and she used it for the business of the city.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632607"> The same should apply to our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who has to conduct business on behalf of citizens of this country. Where it gets blurred is when people accompany the Prime Minister who are just friends and they have access. I also want to bring into the debate that this is not about the repayment, although there are issues there because if we look at the repayment costs, there are some really good deals going on. Most people who try to get a flight at Christmas, I think, pay more than $250 to go from Calgary to Ottawa, but maybe that is just me. We will set that aside. The motion is not only about that; it is also about access.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632608">The government seems to be arguing that because some money is paid back, it is okay for friends of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to jump on board with him and fly around the country for social events. It is not okay, and why is that?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632609"> I have noticed in the last number of years, and we have talked about this government and previous governments, that there has become quite a void between the political class, which is creeping, and everyday people. That is what this is about. It is about trying to bring back some sensibility of what these entitlements are for. They are there for the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to do his business, not to have his friend from Calgary, whom I am sure is a fine friend, but why is he on the plane with the Prime Minister to go to social events? </ParaText><ParaText id="3632610">A constituent of mine or of any member of the House cannot call the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and say that they have a friend who wants to go on a flight with the Prime Minister, and they know he is going from Calgary to wherever and can the friend jump on board. They cannot do that. Why? Because they do not have access. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632611">That is what we are talking about. We are talking about the entitlement. We are talking about access to these services. What the Conservatives have done, and it happens when governments and parties have been in power for a while, is that they start to slide and slip and make excuses, and say that they will pay the money back. I am sure many MPs have had to explain in their constituencies and to their base that “I know you are upset that this gentleman got a ride with the Prime Minister, but he paid it back, so it is okay”. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3632612">I suspect that many people would follow up and say that they cannot get on board with the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, or friends of theirs cannot, so why is that okay? </ParaText><ParaText id="3632613"> The Conservative government has started to rationalize its behaviour in a way that is distancing itself from everyday Canadians and in fact from the accountability program that it came in on.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632614">I was on the committee for Bill C-2, the Accountability Act. I remember well the Conservatives saying that we had to change the behaviour of government and that government should no longer act in an entitled way. They brought in some measures that our party supported. Some of them have not been realized, and that is for another speech, but the premise was that we needed to see more accountability. </ParaText><ParaText id="3632615">It was also really about ethics and about this seeming distance between citizens and the political class. There was this notion that if someone knew someone in the PMO or in government, they could get access, they could have favours done, and they could get jobs and appointments to agencies, boards, commissions, or the Senate. It was getting out of hand, and we agreed with the government in 2006 when it brought in the Accountability Act. We agreed with the spirit of it. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632616">However, what we have seen in the last while—and there is quite a list—is that there is a behaviour that tends to creep into governments after they have been in power for a while. At that point we see the rationalization that certain senators had to be appointed “just because”. We have heard it many times. However, the government did not have to appoint those senators. It could have appointed other senators, but it chose not to. It could have appointed people who did not have connections directly to the Conservative Party to agencies, boards, and commissions, but it did not.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632617">The premise was that the government had to put those people in because they would help with its agenda and those people would help the government get there. That is where we have seen this kind of rationalization creep in and take hold, to the point where many people I know in the Conservative Party are very alienated right now. They thought that the Conservative government of the day and its predecessor parties were about bringing accountability to Ottawa and bringing an end to these entitlements at the highest level.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632618">It is really about that. It is bringing us back to that discussion. In the case of planes, should those planes be used only for government business? That is all we are talking about here. It is not about anything else. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632619">It is also about the spirit of what the Conservative government was talking about way back in 2006, when it came into power. Mr. Speaker, you received that mandate as an MP with the party ticket that you ran on. You did it for what you thought were the best reasons to be involved in public service—to represent people—and you were lauded for it. Many people would say that you were elected on that basis.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632620">We are trying to bring people back to that conversation. We are trying to say that when it comes to government services, they are there for the people. </ParaText><ParaText id="3632621">I will make reference to my mother again. When she ran for office—and she passed this on to me—she always said that running for office is like a job interview. We go door to door and we put our resumés forward to ask if people would hire us to represent them. That is what elections are about. In between elections, we work on their behalf.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632622">I sense that we are starting to see that idea slip a bit around here. I sense that people are starting to say that they deserve this car or that entitlement. What happens is the people who are hurting right now, such as seniors and veterans, wonder who is representing them.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632623">At the end of the day, this motion is not just about planes: it is about entitlement, and it is about bringing all of us back to ask what we are here for. These public services, planes in this case, are purchased by taxpayers, by the citizens. Who are those services there for? Who has access to them? This simple, straightforward motion is just to clarify that question.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632624">For those who disagree with the motion, I would ask them how they will rationalize it to their constituents and tell them that it somehow is not fair. There is nothing wrong with voting for this motion. It will not affect you. In fact, people might laud you for getting behind a motion that might bring you back to why you got involved in politics in the first place.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

As a result, from that time on, he has been reimbursing only an amount equivalent to an economy class ticket. </ParaText><ParaText id="3632644">In my opinion, and in the opinion of all my colleagues here today, it is completely unacceptable to change the rules of the game to his advantage in that way, especially since his opponents were the targets of criticism in the past for similar practices.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632645">Last week, we learned that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> used a private jet, paid for by taxpayers, for the travel of Conservative Party fundraisers and that he was sticking taxpayers with the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632646">A close friend of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, Mark Kihn, brought in more than $3.5 million for two of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s election campaigns.

The Conservatives are literally taking an axe to our social safety net by making cuts to employment insurance, protection for seniors, environmental protection, health care, the fight against homelessness, care for veterans, care for refugees, and postal services. I could go on and on.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632649">I find it particularly unacceptable to see frivolous spending when the government is cutting essential services to the public.

Can we let this slip by? I think not.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632654">In April 2005, he also said that Mr. Martin really wanted to have a 10-month election campaign to fly around the country on a jet at taxpayers' expense in order to throw enough money all over the country to cover up the stench of corruption. In his view, that type of campaign was not in the best interests of the country.</ParaText>

I would like to know how many homeless people could be brought in off the street with that money and how many employment insurance benefits could be provided to people who need them. How many people are being deprived of their rights because of this needless spending?</ParaText><ParaText id="3632659">In 2005, when the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> sat in opposition, he made a big fuss about the Liberals, who were taking their backers all over Canada in the prime minister's private planes.

However, he is doing exactly the same thing now and is refusing to change his ways.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632660">Journalist Elizabeth Thompson, who writes for the electronic news service <I>iPolitics</I>, discovered that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took his backers on a trip between Ottawa and Calgary and asked them to pay $260. However, a similar flight in economy class with Air Canada costs between $600 and $800.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632661">I would sure like to provide such perks to my political pals, but I do not because we are not supposed to. I do not have that kind of power anyway.

The flight service operates throughout the year, seven days a week, 24 hours day.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632679">The government ensures that taxpayers' dollars are always respected by strictly adhering to the Treasury Board of Canada's guidelines and policy. The very fact that we are discussing the use of these aircraft today is a testament to the exceptional services offered by our men and women in uniform.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632680"> It seems to me that we need to ground today's debate in a better understanding of the vital role military aircraft, aircrews, and air support play in enabling our armed forces to protect Canada's interests and values at home and abroad.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632681">Readiness can be defined as the preparedness and flexibility needed to deploy in response to government direction, no matter the type, location, or severity of threats. This government has recognized the vital importance of readiness to succeed in ensuring Canada's security, in acting as a solid ally in defending North America, and in doing our fair share internationally, as stated in the Canada first defence strategy.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632682">The Canadian Armed Forces are agile. They are capable of taking on multiple missions at a time. When they need to respond to a natural disaster at home or abroad, they deploy at a moment's notice. When they need to transport representatives of the government on government business, they answer the call.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632683">Our readiness and our flexibility have been proven time and time again. That is why I would like to take a few moments to remind the men and women of this House of some of the security challenges our men and women in uniform have successfully taken on in recent years. They were challenges such as the Afghanistan mission, which saw over 40,000 Canadian Armed Forces members deployed over a 13-year period to help Afghans transition to a more democratic, secure, and prosperous future. There was Operation Mobile in Libya, which helped protect innocent civilians from the forces of the Gaddafi regime and helped move that country towards democracy. There were also hundreds of search and rescue missions mounted in co-operation with other organizations and levels of government, operations that have saved, on average, 1,200 Canadians lives every single year.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632684">Rapid air response, and in particular transport capabilities such as those provided by the Airbus CC-150 Polaris, constitute a key component of readiness for these operations. In today's world, complex security challenges can arise quickly and can escalate rapidly in any part of the globe, from the high Arctic to the desert plains of the Middle East.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632685">Not only are military aircraft usually the first responders when crises arise, ensuring rapid and effective delivery of emergency assistance, they are also key to the sustainability of any mission, because they provide supplies, troops, and medical evacuation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632686">In Afghanistan, for example, the Polaris fleet formed part of the air bridge between Canada and Afghanistan. It transported thousands of passengers and over seven million pounds of cargo during Operation Apollo alone.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632687">When forest fires broke out in Kelowna, B.C., in 2003, the Polaris fleet airlifted around 1,500 troops to the area to battle the flames. When a devastating earthquake hit Pakistan in 2005, Polaris aircraft carried members of the Canadian Armed Forces to that country to provide emergency assistance. Clearly, the Polaris formed a crucial component of operational readiness in all those cases.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632688"> Let us take a more recent example, one that will be fresh in the minds of all present here today: Typhoon Haiyan. On November 8, 2013, it crippled the Philippines, setting off landslides, taking out power and ground transportation, and killing over 6,000 people.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632689">The Canadian Armed Forces' response to this disaster was rapid and effective. It enabled the purification of around 500,000 litres of water, the medical treatment of around 6,500 patients, the delivery of over 230,000 pounds of food, and the clearing of over 130 kilometres of roads.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3632690">This response relied on capabilities like those of the Polaris, which was used to transport members and equipment from Canada's disaster assistance response team to the Philippines.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632691">This government recognizes the vital importance of aircraft like the Polaris to operational readiness and success. That is why we continue to invest in the maintenance of these aircraft, the training and the well-being of their crews and support personnel, and upgrades such as the recent conversion of two Polaris aircraft to strategic air-to-air refuellers for Canada's CF-18 fighter aircraft. That is why we continue to ensure that these assets are available and ready for rapid deployment on Canadian Armed Forces operations around the world.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632692">The proof is in the pudding: the proven ability of the Canadian Armed Forces to respond effectively whenever it has been called upon to do so in recent years.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632693">While it is important for us to discuss the occasional use of the Polaris to ensure the safety and security of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his family, I would ask the men and women of the House to put this debate into its larger context and remember that the Canadian Armed Forces stands ready to serve all Canadians whenever and wherever it is called upon to do so.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

There is not a day that goes by when its members are not standing on guard for us, both here and around the world. Their job is to ensure Canadians are safe and to make a meaningful contribution abroad and on behalf of Canada, and they so proudly do that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632714">As part of this important contribution, the Department of National Defence operates flight services for representatives of the government on government business in accordance with the Treasury Board of Canada's guidelines and its policy. This flight service operates throughout the year, seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day. As with all its activities, National Defence strives to use resources in the most economical, efficient, and cost-effective manner when it comes to the use of the aircraft. It is appropriate, however, to put this debate into context.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632715">The efforts of our men and women in uniform begin right here at home, and their top priority is the security of Canada and of all Canadians. Additionally, another key role of the Armed Forces is supporting civilian authorities during a crisis such as a national disaster, which is one of its additional core missions. The devastating floods that hit Alberta in June 2013, for example, are still fresh in our memories. That flash flooding was extremely dangerous, put the lives of Canadians at risk, forced road closures, damaged the infrastructure, and isolated entire communities. When the Province of Alberta asked the Canadian Armed Forces for assistance, our military responded by deploying approximately 2,300 personnel to save lives, reduce any human suffering, and mitigate property damage. Our men and women in uniform made Albertans and all of Canada proud.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632716">Search and rescue aircraft in the Royal Canadian Air Force are generally the first military assets involved in the assistance effort. They provide evacuation and aeromedical support to people in need. The Royal Canadian Air Force participated in Alberta with six Griffon helicopters as well as two CH-149 Cormorant helicopters and one Hercules aircraft, as well as the Aurora. About 100 personnel from the RCAF were part of these operations. One of the most amazing efforts was in the Kananaskis area west of Calgary, where two Griffon helicopters and one Cormorant evacuated more than 200 people from hotels impacted by the floods.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632717">These kinds of rescues are remarkable, and they also remind us that the Canadian Armed Forces makes search and rescue a priority every day across this country. An incredible search and rescue operation happened just this past December when a fire broke out at a student residence in Kingston and a crane worker was stranded about 100 metres above the blaze. The Kingston fire department and police requested search and rescue assistance to save the man, and a CH-146 Griffon was launched from Trenton, complete with a search and rescue crew. In a brave and very delicate operation, as I am sure members can imagine, the search and rescue technician and crew helped hoist the crane worker into the helicopter and quickly airlifted him to a hospital where he was treated for burns. That rescue clearly was a great success, and yet another of those examples of how the Canadian Armed Forces uses military aircraft to keep Canadians safe each and every day.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632718">Of course, our military has a long history of contributing to peace and stability abroad, and that is why deploying in response to crises around the world is one of the six core missions of our Armed Forces and why our military maintains contingency plans for rapid deployment to the scene of a disaster overseas. A recent example, which has already been cited, is of the Armed Forces' incredible work when a devastating typhoon hit the Philippines in November 2013. Typhoon Haiyan was one of the strongest storms of its kind ever—</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I consider an international request for the use of our aircraft and military personnel in dire circumstances, where people in various nations are at risk, to be both a government and humanitarian purpose, in accordance with the values of Canada. I know that the member is new and does not understand the Canadian Armed Forces, but hopefully that clarifies it.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632743">In that situation, transport was also provided by one of the Challengers, a Polaris, and three of our new Globemaster aircraft. Also three CH-146 Griffin helicopters were on the ground for medical evacuation, mobility, and coordination, which is a government purpose in a humanitarian cause overseas. However, I do not want to put too fine a point on the notion of government purpose here. Humanitarian operations, such as those in the Philippines, show that Canada is a global player and that the men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces are prepared for a vast range of missions. </ParaText><ParaText id="3632744">As we know, one of our military's defining contributions to international peace and security was in Afghanistan, where our armed forces were employed for more than a decade. We will always remember their efforts and their sacrifices. We know these would not have been possible without the right equipment provided by our government. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632745">One of the shining examples was the 429 Transport Squadron, which was an integral part of our military's mission in Afghanistan since 2002. As part of the squadron, the CC-130 Hercules tactical airlift detachment logged over 1,800 operational flying hours on more than 320 missions in the Arabian Gulf from January to August of 2002. In 2003, the squadron successfully delivered 30,000 pounds of materials to a bombed-out runway in Kandahar while under direct small arms and rocket fire. With the introduction of the Globemaster in 2007, the squadron began to deliver troops and trade to Kabul, Kandahar, and Bagram, making a vital contribution to the Canadian and international efforts there. </ParaText><ParaText id="3632746">When we discuss the use of government aircraft we should understand how they enable the Canadian Armed Forces to do their incredible work and in effect project Canada around the world to our allies in a very positive light. This work is crucial to the security of Canadians, whether they are assisting civilian authorities in response to floods at home, helping local authorities rescue Canadians in danger, providing humanitarian relief to those in need around the world, or contributing to security abroad with our international partners. The Canadian Armed Forces help keep Canada and Canadians safe every single day. They use the right equipment to do it, whether on the ground, sea, or air.</ParaText>

In this case, we are talking about the use of government planes to transport Conservative Party fundraisers around the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632762">Let me be clear. I am not disputing the use of government jets to transport the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, his family, his security detail, or even public servants assisting the Prime Minister with government business. To me, the line is crossed when party fundraisers are flying on government jets. As we have now learned, that was a regular practice for the Conservatives. In particular, the flight logs reveal that Mark Kihn, who lists his job as a fundraising projects manager for the Conservative Party, has been a regular passenger, travelling with the Prime Minister on government jets every year from 2007 to 2012.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632763">While this may seem to some a narrow issue for an opposition day motion, it tries to shine a light on a failure by the Conservatives to recognize the importance of respecting the line between the public interest and party interest. On those grounds, it is clearly wrong to use government jets to transport Conservative Party fundraisers. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632764">As I said at the beginning of my remarks, this example illustrates a larger pattern by the Conservatives, which is to seek every partisan advantage for themselves, whether by using their majority to change the rules or by running as close to the line as possible when it comes to the existing rules. We have certainly seen this in Bill <Document DbId="6398775" Type="3">C-23</Document>, where the Conservatives have included a provision exempting fundraising expenses from election spending limits. Spending limits, as many will know, were introduced in Canada in the 1974 Election Expenses Act in an attempt to level the playing field for elections, so that those with the most resources would not automatically win elections. </ParaText><ParaText id="3632765">Public support for spending limits as an essential part of electoral fairness has always been and still remains very high. The comprehensive Canadian election study conducted in 2000 specifically asked about this and found that 93% of Canadians supported spending limits for candidates and political parties, but what this motion points to is an attempt to get around those kinds of spending limits by using government resources for partisan purposes. Both the transport of Conservative Party fundraisers on government jets and the attempt to undermine spending limits in Bill <Document DbId="6398775" Type="3">C-23</Document> violate the fundamental sense of electoral fairness that is an essential part of our Canadian democracy.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632766">These attempts to skirt the rules on election spending limits are not new for the Conservatives. In fact, they began with the first omnibus budget bill. In that bill, the Conservatives used their majority to eliminate public funding for political parties. Normally, in seeking to change fundamental rules in our democracy, we would expect the governing party to consult widely and seek the broadest support for changes to the rules. We would expect this in Bill <Document DbId="6398775" Type="3">C-23</Document>, and we have not seen it. We would certainly expect them to hold those kinds of consultation and not to sneak in changes through what should have been a technical budget bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632767">As in the case of Bill <Document DbId="6398775" Type="3">C-23</Document>—</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

By no stretch of the imagination can we qualify transporting government fundraisers as a government purpose.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632777">The Conservatives promised to do better than the Liberals when it came to the use of public funds and accountability. However, it is not good enough for the Conservatives to say, as they have repeatedly this morning, that at least they are not as bad as the Liberals when it comes to the use of government jets. That is hardly a defence for transporting fundraisers on those jets. It may be an improvement over the Liberals, but both parties developed a sense of entitlement when they were in office that I am sure rankles ordinary Canadians, as it does me.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632778">The motion before us today is fairly simple. It does not try to address all of the aspects of the Conservatives' pattern of seeking maximum partisan advantage, whether by stretching the rules or using its majority to change those rules. The motion is very simple: Should the Conservatives be able to shuttle their party fundraisers around the country on government jets? I think that most Canadians would agree with me; the answer to that is a simple no.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632779">What did we hear on this topic before the Conservatives were in government? We have heard extensive quotations in the debate this morning from members of their party, criticizing the Liberals for their misuse of public funds. It is hard for me to imagine how difficult it must be for Conservatives to stand up and speak, especially if they come from that old reform tradition in the Conservative Party. How do they stand up and speak on this bill today when they were such strong champions of accountability?</ParaText><ParaText id="3632780"><B>An hon. member:</B> Can we get to hear some of those quotes?</ParaText><ParaText id="3632781"><B>Mr. Randall Garrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot of them this morning, and I am not going to indulge in them again now.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632782">My point is that we have a pattern; we have a pattern of stretching the rules. When we looked back at the last election and the robocalls that were made, we were not able to identify exactly who was responsible. We see this pattern of pressing the lines and using every advantage. We have a judge saying that the Conservative Party database was used to make the calls that attempted to direct voters to the wrong polling place to suppress voting. With that, along with a pattern of exploiting every advantage and pushing the rules to the limit, we have to wonder whether the Conservative Party has not at least created the atmosphere that makes it responsible for this kind of election abuse.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632783">I find myself speaking to a very simple motion. We heard from the Liberals, eventually, that they plan to support it in the House. I would be interested in knowing if there are any Conservatives on the other side who would say that the motion is very simple. They should maybe all say it. The motion is very simple. It says that government resources should be used for government purposes. I cannot see what they would disagree with in the motion.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632784">I have been accused of being naive, as well as off topic, this morning, but it is such a simple motion that it would seem easy for the government to stand up with the other parties to say that this is what accountability means. “If we are champions of accountability, we will only use public resources for public purposes”.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632785">Again, the Conservatives have tried to push the issue off to some kind of attack on the Canadian Forces or on the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s security detail. No one on this side of the House is doubting that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> cannot travel as an ordinary Canadian can every day.

He is going to have to do that, and he does repay the public treasury. However, that is not the question. The question is on the inappropriate extension of the use of those public resources for partisan purposes, which is what we have in front of us.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632787">It is unfortunate that we have to have these kinds of debates in the House of Commons. It would seem to me to be common sense that a Conservative Party fundraiser does not get on the plane. They should use ordinary transit, which the party pays for.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632788">The Conservatives have said that they are billing back and paying for the resources they use. However, this is not the question. It is on the appropriateness of putting that person on the plane.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632789"> Now, we can dispute whether they are paying back the real cost of those flights, and it does not look to me like they are. However, even if they were paying the real cost, I think Canadians still have a problem with it. They would ask why we have party officials going to fundraising events to raise money for the Conservative Party on this jet.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632790">At the end of the day, I hope to see all members standing in favour of accountability of public funds and putting a very strict line between public and partisan interests, something which the Conservative Party seems to have trouble doing.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The motion does not go as far as many of the cabinet ministers sitting on the front bench would have gone if there had been a different government in power. </ParaText><ParaText id="3632811">We have all read quotes, and during the day members have heard innumerable of them, which questioned why the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> could not get on a regular plane like other Canadians. We do have business class at the front, and those accommodations can be made.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632812">There are countries where prime ministers actually do that, and our cabinet ministers get on the plane all the time. However, this motion is not about getting the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> off of the Challenger and on to a commercial flight. The world has changed since 9/11, and we are far more conscious of security. That is why I am proud to be standing up and speaking to a motion that takes that into consideration.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632813">However, it behooves us, then, that when there is a government plane to be used for government business and also to transport the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his family for security reasons, that this is what the plane is used for. If the Prime Minister wants his bagmen, whose job it is to travel around the country to make money for the Conservative Party, it does not matter whether they are enjoying a holiday with the Prime Minister; they can join him when he gets to the other side. That is not the purpose of the Challenger and its availability to the Prime Minister. Canadians are paying attention because of that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632814">Last week, I heard rhetoric that the fundraiser had paid back the fare at commercial value. He paid back two hundred and something dollars for a trip that he took over the Christmas period.

For those of us who have to shop around for cheap flights, we know that is not possible.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632815">I noted with interest that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was very vocal, almost vitriolic, in his criticisms of the Liberal Party. By the way, I would say that he was justified because there were all kinds of abuses. None of us who are working people in Canada, and taxpayers, can stand for that kind of largesse that gives an individual a sense of entitlement just because constituents have enough faith to make them a member of Parliament. It is that kind of largesse that is concerning Canadians now. The very Prime Minister, who used to be very vocal against that kind of largesse by my colleagues in the far corner, is now finding himself caught in the same thing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632816">I notice that the rules were changed once the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> came to office.

The crews I have talked to absolutely love it and are grateful for having it in their fleet.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632859">Within seven months of delivery in January 2011, the first CC-130J was already flying its first mission to Afghanistan. By the end of 2013, the new J model Hercules had surpassed one million flying hours worldwide. As usual, our transport fleet will probably be the high time users of that aircraft type worldwide.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632860">These hours were spent coming to the direct aid of Canadians, evacuating them from the dangers of forest fires in the summer of 2011, and serving around the world in locations such as the Mediterranean in support of Operation Mobile in Libya and the remote Canadian Forces Station Alert, located just 800 kilometres from the geographic North Pole, and which the PM has visited himself, courtesy of the Royal Canadian Air Force.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632861">In addition to renewing existing capabilities, the government has provided the air force with new capabilities that greatly enhance its range of operations. For example, the acquisition of the CC-177 Globemaster strategic airlift in 2007 has greatly improved the RCAF's ability to respond and deploy quickly at home and abroad. With this purchase, our air force has significantly reduced its dependence on allied or contracted strategic airlift when transporting troops and equipment in a theatre of operations or when delivering lifesaving supplies to an area hit by a natural disaster.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632862">Previously, for example, during the floods in Winnipeg and the ice storms in Quebec, we had to rely on United States Air Force C-17s to deliver the heavy equipment we needed. We do not need to do that anymore. In fact, we can now turn around and help the citizens of the United States if they have a particular need. We are in a position to assist.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632863">In August 2007, within days of being delivered, our first Globemaster's inaugural mission was to deliver emergency supplies to Jamaica in response to a hurricane. More recently, it was ideally suited to help the French support mission in Mali, and it was essential to Canada's contribution to the relief efforts in the Philippines in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan. As well, this aircraft has taken the PM to Afghanistan in support of our troops on the ground.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3632864">In addition to the Globemaster, the delivery of a medium-to- heavy lift helicopter capability, the CH-147F Chinook, was also a priority for this government. This too is a new capability for the Royal Canadian Air Force, one that will increase its ability to operate and succeed as a multi-role, combat-capable air force.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632865">Internationally, we have already seen the tremendous value of Chinook helicopter operations in Afghanistan. The helicopter has airlifted troops and equipment, protecting them from improvised explosive devices that were encountered on roads. The air force was proud to take delivery of its first of 15 CH-147F Chinooks in June last year. The project is on schedule to deliver all 15 aircraft by the end of this year.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632866">When the new helicopters, which were designed especially for Canada's unique needs, become fully operational later this year they will increase our military's mobility, flexibility, and ability to deploy and to perform complex operations both here at home and abroad. The new Chinooks will enhance the military's ability to operate in remote and isolated areas and will provide assistance following natural disasters such as floods, fires, earthquakes and more; and provide mobility support to the Canadian army, other government departments, and law-enforcement agencies and other civilian authorities, such as the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3632867">These procurement initiatives, to highlight just a few, are prime examples of how the government is providing the men and women in uniform with the equipment they need to do their jobs. This commitment was further solidified with the government's announcement of the new defence procurement strategy last February. Defence procurement continues to be, above all, about getting the right equipment, at the right time, at the right place, and at the right price, to our men and women in uniform. They deserve nothing less.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632868">The Government of Canada is committed to maintaining a modern, flexible, and agile Canadian Armed Forces, supported by a professional, multi-role air force. We will continue to provide the men and women of the Royal Canadian Air Force with what they need to excel in their wide range of missions: whether conducting surveillance at home to defend Canada and the North American continent or quickly deploying a fighter-jet capability at home or to overseas operations; shuttling equipment and personnel deployed on operations, or transporting government officials as they do business on behalf of Canadians. All the while, this government will continue to ensure that the use of government aircraft follows the guidelines and policies strictly outlined by the Treasury Board of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632869">I just want to say “Per ardua ad astra” and happy birthday to all our friends in the Royal Canadian Air Force.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

One would think that would be something that the opposition members would look at if they were going to take an entire day of the House of Commons’ time, that they might actually do a little research. But the answer was “I don't know, I didn't look into it; you guys have that information”. All Canadians have that information because it is made public.</ParaText><ParaText id="3632884">Imagine this: a full day of the House of Commons’ time when we have issues with respect to our economy, with respect to our natural resources and environment, issues with respect to the situation in Ukraine and the incredible leadership the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has shown to bring the world community onside.

They get up in the House, day in and day out, and talk about all the bad things that everyone else is doing.

I congratulate the hon. member and wish him good luck.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633218">I want to complete what I was talking about before question period, and that is how disappointed I am that a motion like this was brought forward in the House. An entire day has been devoted to talking about the fact, as the <Affiliation DbId="181199" Type="96">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> in question period said, that in over eight years, somebody has joined the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> on the government Challenger jet five times.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633219">Let us take a look at what the government has done with respect to the Challenger jets. This is a government that, when in opposition, campaigned on the fact that the use of the Challenger jet was out of control by the previous Liberal government. We campaigned on the fact that when we were elected, we would change how that is done and would significantly reduce the use of Challenger jets. The use of the Challenger jet by both the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and members of cabinet has been reduced by some 75% since we become government. What that has enabled us to do is to sell four of the six Challenger jets because they are just not being used.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633220">Moreover, this <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> put in place something new, which was that when the Challenger was going to be used for non-governmental purposes, the equivalent cost of a commercial flight would be reimbursed to the Department of National Defence. That is why the Conservative Party has repaid thousands of dollars to the Department of National Defence and why, in instances where the Prime Minister has used the Challenger for personal reasons because he cannot fly any other way but through secure government aircraft, he also reimburses the taxpayers the equivalent cost.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633221">We also heard during question period today the <Affiliation DbId="181199" Type="96">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> say that he could not find any equivalent fares that were paid by some individuals. I have in my hand the fares of WestJet. It is a commercial airline. The opposition was unable to find fares. I found 12. I will stop at 12, but the list goes on. The fares are $282, $261, $266.10, $261.58, $266.10, and on and on. </ParaText><ParaText id="3633222">Ultimately, with this motion New Democrats have clearly signified that they actually have nothing to talk about of any substance because they know, like all Canadians know, that when it comes to issues that actually matter to Canadians— balancing the budget, cutting taxes, supporting small, medium and large job creators—this government is on the right track. </ParaText><ParaText id="3633223">Moreover, when we talk about the Canadian Armed Forces, Canadians know that it was this government which ended the decade of darkness we inherited from the Liberal Party and increased the budget for our armed forces by some 27%. We bought new aircraft, the Globemaster. We all remember the sad spectacle when there were international crises and Canada had to beg and borrow from our international allies to get our troops around the world. Those days are done and our allies know that they can always count on Canada. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633224">The list goes on. It is this government and the leadership of this <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and this cabinet and the support, of course, of all members of Parliament on the Conservative side that have helped restore Canada, that have seen us through the global economic downturn.

Is the NDP actually suggesting that once one becomes Prime Minister of our country, one is no longer entitled to have friends and that is all done? Does the Leader of the Opposition not have his friends over to Stornoway, the government-funded residence for the Leader of the Opposition? Does he not bring people in his taxpayer-funded limousine? I think he probably does. I do not think there is anything wrong with that. </ParaText><ParaText id="3633228">The Leader of the Opposition himself indicated that it was five times over eight years.

In essence, what the opposition is saying is no one can ever travel with the Prime Minister. He cannot have any friends, and if he does, it is not good enough just to pay what a commercial equivalent would be. One would have to pay thousands of dollars more, so no one would ever be allowed to be on that Challenger jet. That makes no sense. </ParaText>

Just last week, a reporter from iPolitics discovered that a government plane, paid for by taxpayers, had been used to fly Mark Kihn, one of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s good friends and one of the government's main fundraisers. In our opinion, the issue is important enough for us to take a day to discuss it.</ParaText>

Personally, I feel that it is an economic issue. The government says that certain services have to be eliminated and that it will not be able to make federal health transfers at previous levels because there is not enough money. However, we can see clearly that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is using taxpayers' money to help his Conservative buddies. Therefore, this is an economic issue, in my opinion.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633251">It is also an ethical issue.

That would get them a free trip. Things do not work like that in Canada. Unfortunately, it is an issue for which the current government and the Prime Minister fought when the Liberals were committing the same kinds of swindles.

He thinks that we are mean because we do not want him to have a social life. That is not at all what we are talking about today. We are talking about the fact that the Prime Minister travels in a secure plane. Even though I do not share his political opinions, I think it is important that the Prime Minister, his family and his children travel in a secure plane. A country like ours must ensure that he receives the protection he needs. If that protection comes in the form of a secure plane, that is fine by me. However, if one of his friends boards that plane, and if that friend is the guy who runs Conservative fundraising campaigns, he should pay more than $260 to board the plane.

We have a wealth of natural resources and raw materials. We have good universities and can become the richest country in the world.

I find that disheartening.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633263">What I find even more disheartening is to see that the Conservative members are not even listening to me. We moved a motion and, since this morning, we have been hearing a lot of sophistry. They try to ridicule our arguments. They do not even have the decency to listen to what we are saying. If they engaged in this discussion, then they might realize that this is indeed an abuse of public money.

Access to Information documents reveal that the Prime Minister is increasingly using Challenger jets, not only for his own family's travel, but for personal friends and Conservative Party fundraisers.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633289">Furthermore, the government has changed the rules so that it only has to reimburse taxpayers an amount equivalent to economy class airfare. Those jets cost nearly $4,000 an hour to fly, yet the Conservatives, after changing the rules in their favour, only reimbursed taxpayers an average of $260 a flight. Wow. No wonder they are using these jets so frequently for personal and partisan reasons; they get to travel like rock stars but pay seat sale rates.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633290">When average Canadians are looking to book a flight, they tend to go online, compare prices and schedules, then choose the best deal.

They have devised quite the scheme to get taxpayers to subsidize their non-government-related travel.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633291">iPolitics, through an access to information request for documents, found that the Conservative Party has reimbursed the Department of National Defence 17 times, for a total cost of over $37,000, but the actual cost of the flights in question is about $118,000.

I have three examples to illustrate this point.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633293">The first example is with respect to the Senate. The Conservatives promised not to nominate new senators but went ahead and appointed 59 of their closest friends, including Pamela Wallin, Mike Duffy, and Patrick Brazeau. The Senate is under investigation. A Senate expense scandal showed a complete disregard for ethics and transparency. The NDP says that it is time to roll up that red carpet. The record of the Conservatives on the Senate shows they are no different from the Liberals when it comes to a sense of entitlement.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633294">The second example is with respect to the Conservatives abuse of Parliament, specifically time allocation. The Conservatives have shut down debate more than 50 times over the past two years. That is more than any other government in Canadian history. There is a constant use of in-camera proceedings in committees, thereby shutting Canadians out of the proceedings. That severely restricts studies. The Conservatives also pick pro-government witnesses.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633295">When it comes to contempt, the 2011 election was triggered after the Conservatives were found to be in contempt of Parliament for misleading parliamentarians and refusing to provide key details on proposed bills and their cost estimates. The Conservatives record of abusing Parliament as a democratic institution shows they are no different from the Liberals when it comes to transparency and accountability.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633296">The third example is with respect to the Conservatives unfair elections act. The bill would remove powers from the Chief Electoral Officer. That individual would be stripped of investigative powers as well as the power to engage in public education. The bill would make voting much harder for vulnerable Canadians. It would end the practice of vouching, and voter ID cards would no longer be accepted to confirm identification. The unfair elections bill would change political financing rules in favour of the Conservatives.

							<ParaText id="3633308">I would like to expand on what this means. Last month I held my annual series of town hall meetings as part of my community consultations. I asked constituents to rank by importance a variety of public policy issues and economic concerns. As was the case in every year I have held these consultations, health care was the highest-ranked issue. </ParaText><ParaText id="3633309">Since coming to power, the government has made little to no progress on reducing wait times, increasing home care, ensuring better access to primary care, or implementing a cost-saving pharmacare plan.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633310">Yesterday the 2004 health care accord officially expired, with no new accord to replace it. Instead of negotiating a new deal, the Conservatives unilaterally imposed a new funding formula on the provinces and have walked away from the commitments to setting standards on wait times, home care, and prescription drugs. The government's record on health care is clear. It is failing to show leadership on this crucial file and is opening the door to increased disparities across our country.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633311">As official opposition, the NDP is listening to Canadians and is holding the government to account for its failed record on health care.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633312">Today we are holding Conservatives to account for their abuse of taxpayers' money and the culture of corruption and entitlement that seems to have overtaken the leadership of the Conservative Party. The public purse is out $118,000 because the government has been treating government jets as personal and partisan taxis. That $118,000 equals old age security for 19 seniors, GIS allowance for 20 seniors, or the average annual pension for five retired veterans. </ParaText><ParaText id="3633313">The Conservative government has done little to address the challenges facing Canada's aging population or to provide adequate services to our Canadian veterans. I find this appalling. </ParaText><ParaText id="3633314">Instead, Conservatives have made it harder for seniors to retire with dignity. OAS changes mean many are forced to work an additional two years before they are allowed to retire. </ParaText><ParaText id="3633315">This is unacceptable. We need change. The NDP is focused on change, and we will bring that change in 2015.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It is a privileged notion, but it is also part of doing business in a country as affluent, as vast, and as broad as Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="3633339">We are talking about this issue because it is a touchstone. It is an example of whether we are stewards of the public trust and stewards of the tax dollar and understand that our roles and responsibilities go beyond the norm in making sure that not only are we ensuring the integrity of the public purse but are seen to be ensuring it. </ParaText><ParaText id="3633340">We are talking access by the ruling party, the front bench, and occasionally guests on board private jet aircraft going to different events. I think we all recognize that a prime minister of Canada has unique responsibilities and circumstances that require his or her access to these types of travel services.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633341">What I note about the debate is that we have not necessarily done a very good job of isolating the issues, proposing and formulating solutions, and seeking consensus on solutions. I suggest we have not used this debate very wisely because I really have not heard a concrete agenda come forward as to how we can move the goalposts and actually increase the level of accountability, create a consensus as to what that accountability should be, and then enact it.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633342">I have heard a lot of talk during the course of the morning and afternoon about “That crowd did it, so do not expect us to do anything different” or “We never had a chance to do it, so we can say whatever we want.” It is not really so simple or trite as just that. Canadians who are listening to this debate carefully are asking for a little higher discussion and resolution to evolve.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633343">If we simply say the goalpost is what was done in the past and anyone who did anything that may bear criticism in the past is no longer competent to participate in the debate, the debate shuts down pretty quickly. In fact, just about every debate that will ever occur in the House will shut down very quickly if that is the standard we use. One of our objectives, responsibilities, and requirements as parliamentarians is to move the debate and the standard forward. We have not done that today.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633344">For example, if we were to simply say there is a vacant seat on an aircraft and that it is therefore not only reasonable but responsible for a civilian non-government employee, someone outside the government's normal business, to occupy that seat on a private executive jet to travel with a formal government party to another location, I am not so sure that would bear scrutiny if we were to apply the same principle to a military aircraft going between Trenton and Halifax. If I wanted my son's hockey team to go on it because it was empty and had some space in it, and my son's hockey team was going to Halifax for a tournament, why could the whole hockey team not be put on that military plane to go to Halifax? </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3633345">It does not seem that this is a sensible option, administratively, from the point of view of ensuring that taxpayers' assets are protected and that stewardship of those assets is ensured. The military would probably be the first to say that it is not a responsible use of defence assets. Why is it then okay for a civilian, a friend of someone, a business partner, or a friend of a political party to accompany the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister </Affiliation>on that jet if there is an empty seat on it? Why would someone not do that? It is because there is a protocol. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633346">Perhaps it is not the right standard to use to simply say that if there is a seat vacant, it is open for the next occupant who might want to use it. How would we price that seat if indeed we were to use it? Perhaps I might be able to bid on a plane ticket at a charity auction. If the plane ticket came in at $50 to go between Halifax and Ottawa, maybe that would be the market value of the seat. That is what I saw here today. There was a little bit of trying to determine the lowest value of a seat. We would establish that by getting the lowest fare one could possibly find and using it as the benchmark. There might be a lot of $50 seats in private executive jets in the very near future. </ParaText><ParaText id="3633347">I am not so sure this is the right standard to use for pricing this particular service and for making sure that the taxpayers' investment is protected.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633348">What the jet should be used for is also relevant and important. It would have been good if we could have come to a consensus within the House as to whether it is right for the Prime Minister to use a Department of National Defence Challenger jet aircraft to go to political events. The answer could be yes if we were to determine that the Prime Minister has certain responsibilities and has to travel on this aircraft, based on RCMP security advice. The question then becomes whether it is something that should occur on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis. We did not establish that. </ParaText><ParaText id="3633349">The other thing we need to establish is whether it is fair for the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who has to use these jets, to expect the taxpayers to transport his family to different events. Again, the argument comes back to the Prime Minister having to travel by this aircraft to go to other locations in the country. The question then becomes not whether it is responsible but how often it is responsible for the Prime Minister to use this jet. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633350">If we establish a credible standard of accountability, give people confidence that we understand that the stewardship of taxpayers' dollars is our primary objective, and at the same time take complicated matters, assimilate a variety of issues, and come forward with a credible plan that meets a 21st century standard, we will have done our jobs. I cannot see how we have done that here today, because we are really no further ahead in establishing a reasonable, responsible standard for an executive of the Prime Minister's Office or a minister of national defence to use when allocating or accounting for these resources and reporting the use of these resources to the public. Maybe at another time we might be in a position to do so.</ParaText>

Communication on the use of the jets is normally achieved through filing an access to information request.

It would be made available on the Internet for all to see. Those who were part of the flight manifest would be recorded.

I had the opportunity to address it through questions. I have listened attentively to a number of speakers on the motion, and a number of questions come to mind. I would like to look at what I believe the NDP is hoping to address with this particular motion.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633365">Some of the consistent phrases we get from the members are “misuse of taxpayer dollars”, “abuse of public trust”, “holding government accountable”, “wasting government resources”, and “abuse of public funds”. </ParaText><ParaText id="3633366">We have had members, in particular the most recent NDP speaker, say that it is the heart of the matter. Let there be no doubt that what offends the New Democrats on this particular day is the issue of abuse of public funds. That is something I want to spend some time talking about, because as they have clearly indicated, that is what is really at issue.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633367">It was not that long ago that we had our opposition day motion. Members will recall that we had an opposition day motion that received the unanimous support of the House. With that particular motion, we too were trying to get more transparency and accountability inside the House. Who would oppose something of that nature? It was with regard to the issue of proactive disclosure.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633368">Members will recall that it was the leader of the Liberal Party, back in June of last year, who stood in his place and tried to get the unanimous support of the House for proactive disclosure for all members of Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633369">A number of New Democratic MPs said no. As a result, we were not able to enact it in June. We were not overly discouraged by that, because we believe in transparency and accountability. The leader of the Liberal Party has talked a lot about that. He mandated that if a person is a Liberal member of Parliament, he or she will be participating in proactive disclosure. It was to take effect, I believe, in the last quarter.</ParaText>

We had to participate, because he made it in the form of a motion for which he could not get unanimous support, and we wanted to move forward.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633371">It was not that much longer before the Conservatives jumped on board on that particular issue. It was only the leader of the NDP and the New Democratic caucus who resisted. They resisted for months.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633372">The abuse of public funds, public trust, misuse of tax dollars, and holding government accountable being the heart of the matter, we introduced an opposition day motion that, in essence, forced all members of the House into proactive disclosure. The NDP members were kind of cornered, and they ultimately voted in favour of it. Why? I suspect that they had to vote in favour of it. </ParaText><ParaText id="3633373"> Part of proactive disclosure means that we have to now tell our voters, or all Canadians, where we are flying and the actual costs of our flights.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633374">We have been doing this for months within the Liberal Party caucus. However, because of that opposition day motion, the NDP will have to do it. Its members did not volunteer.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633375">To me, this was a very productive opposition motion. It realized an obligation to improve the system.</ParaText>

Nothing prevents him from going ahead and establishing party offices wherever he wants, but there is a bit of a condition here: it should not be the taxpayers of Canada who are responsible for financing those offices. If it wants to open up a political office in Saskatchewan or Quebec, it should be the New Democratic Party that foots the bill and not the taxpayers. However, he has found a way through the leader's office and allocated money that was meant to support the leader here in Ottawa. He has kind of shuffled those responsibilities off. Is that not an abuse of taxpayers' dollars? </ParaText><ParaText id="3633379">This issue is going to the procedure and House affairs committee and in part to the Board of Internal Economy committee, and there have been references to other outside independent organizations on this. </ParaText>

That is all because there was not enough money to purchase a new sorting machine that would have increased efficiency. Businesses are getting their cheques later, people are getting their bills later, and now there is going to be a reduction of home delivery services as well. The consul general's office closed in Detroit. Service Canada, with one of the highest records of staff, two years ago received an award for efficiency. Do members know what the result was?

The response to which he takes exception was provided to the House on March 6, 2014. While I can see that there was a two-week adjournment shortly thereafter, the hon. member then waited until the fourth sitting day after the March break, or three full calendar weeks after his question was answered, before coming forward with his question of privilege. In short, the member's question of privilege should fail on this ground alone.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633489">Nonetheless, I would like to address the substantive issues he raised. The hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170649" Type="2">Avalon</Affiliation> has claimed that there is a prima facie case of privilege here based on his assertion that he, in the performance of his duties, has been intentionally interfered with, obstructed, and impeded. Yet the hon. member has not indicated which duties have been so impeded or in which manner he has been impeded in relation to those duties. This is simply a matter of being dissatisfied with the response that was provided.</ParaText>

Later in his arguments, he indicated, “The question I asked, in 2010, was answered and the information was provided”. If members were to check the records of the House for the third session of the 40th Parliament, which captures the year 2010, they would see that the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170649" Type="2">Avalon</Affiliation> asked about a dozen written questions that calendar year.

							</ParaText><ParaText id="3633508">While the government's response did include a one-page chart with specific projects, it is important to note the following qualifications that were in the body of that response.

ACOA did not and does not track projects by riding.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633518">The one-pager prepared in response to Question No. 92, probably because it was a more narrowly crafted question, seems to have been a courtesy extended to the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170649" Type="2">Avalon</Affiliation> by doing a quick search of projects that were “on or near” his own riding. This is quite some distance from the four-year fishing expedition he presented in Question No.176.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633519">This particular fishing expedition was even broader than the past one, because he was seeking information on all applications received, including those that were rejected. With respect to the latter category, I understand that answering it would have required the agency to figure out who might have been from Avalon and from there contact each one of them to see if they would agree to allow their personal information to be divulged in order to follow the Privacy Act and the principles of the Access to Information Act. There is simply no reasonable way of accomplishing this within the 45-day deadline he requested under the Standing Orders.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633520">In my answer, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170649" Type="2">Avalon</Affiliation> is directed to the agency's website for a list of all approved projects in Newfoundland and Labrador. From there, the hon. member can generate a list, just like the one he would have had as part of the 600-page response he got in 2010, from the website.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633521">Surely, the hon. member knows his constituency well enough to be able to assess from this comprehensive list which of the projects are located in his own riding and which fall into one of the six other ridings in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633522">In conclusion, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170649" Type="2">Avalon</Affiliation> has not raised his issue in a timely manner. He has not given any indication as to how he has been impeded. He has not argued anything here other than dissatisfaction with the response provided. Finally, he has blurred the distinctions between the 2010 questions he cited and his most recent question.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633523">Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I believe you can easily rule that there is no prima facie case of privilege to be found here.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Tonight I am particularly proud to represent the New Democratic Party as we bring forward a motion that we believe is essential for the development of long-term planning for health in this country, which is a pan-Canadian strategy for palliative care.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3633528">I am very proud to be here this evening to move this motion on behalf of the New Democratic Party. We are asking the federal government and Canada's Parliament to establish a pan-Canadian strategy, ensure access to palliative care, and work with the provinces and territories so that all levels of government can develop a standard of care that ensures access to quality palliative care.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3633529">To begin, I would like to make note of a few things for the people watching across Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633530"> I would like to thank the medical leaders, medical organizations, front-line service providers who are serving people in need, and the social workers, pharmacists, nurses and doctors, for the support that we received. I would also like to thank members of the various spiritual communities of Canada who have supported the New Democrats in this motion. </ParaText><ParaText id="3633531">On a personal note, I would like to mention that my late brother-in-law John King, who was a close friend and a brilliant young man, lost his life much too early to cancer. After the 2008 election, I came home and spent the last few nights with John at Perram House, in Toronto.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633532">Perram House was an extraordinary palliative care centre. At the time, I thought it was the norm. I thought that when Canadians became sick, there were Perram Houses everywhere. It was after Perram House closed, in the city of Toronto where my brother-in-law was dying, that I realized there was a lack of good quality palliative care beds.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633533"> Certainly there is good quality palliative care in hospitals. However, with regard to community-centred, spiritually centred, communal-familiar centred care, it made me realize that across this country we do not have a standard forum for ensuring that families and individuals have the support they need.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633534">I would also like to thank the incredible work of the all-party committee. The Parliament of Canada is known as a relatively toxic place at most times, but members of all parties came together on this vital issue and worked hard. I would like to recognize the members of the Conservative, Liberal, and New Democratic parties who worked on the study and wanted to bring forward to Parliament the need for us to establish this pan-Canadian strategy on palliative care. I believe that the motion I am bringing forward on behalf of the New Democratic Party is carrying forward the work of this all-party committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633535">One of its key recommendations is that the committee strongly urges that the federal government re-establish a palliative care secretariat for the sake of developing and implementing a national palliative and end-of-life care strategy. In honour of the work that my colleagues in the other parties and New Democrats did on that committee, we are bringing forward that motion tonight. </ParaText><ParaText id="3633536">There has been much discussion lately in the media. Many terms are being used on the issue of dying with dignity and what it means. People are grappling with very complex and emotional issues that touch all of us.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633537">Tonight I would like to use the definition of palliative care that has been offered by the Canadian Medical Association. </ParaText><ParaText id="3633538">The Canadian Medical Association tells us the following:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633539"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Palliative care is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with a life-threatening illness. [It involves] the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification, assessment and treatment of pain and other physical, psychosocial, and spiritual symptoms.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3633540">We can see from the Canadian Medical Association's definition that palliative care is not just about dealing with someone in their final bleak hours. It is the notion of an integrated health strategy that is there for families in their homes. It is not just about the alleviation of suffering, but allowing the individual to have a higher quality of life than they might have otherwise had. It also assures support for the family, community members, and loved ones, who sometimes face an extremely traumatic time. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3633541">The fact that we are having this debate today at the end of the national health accord is very timely. The New Democrats believe, and have believed this since our founding and the days of Tommy Douglas, that the federal government has an important role to play, not in the delivery of service but in working with the provinces and territories to establish norms across this country.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633542">If we look at the situation with an aging population and our increasingly frayed health care system, and with the end of the health accord and less and less money to be delivered to the regions, urban and rural, it becomes incredibly important to ensure that we have an integrated health care strategy.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633543">What would the strategy look like? We know that Parliament played a role before. In 2007, the Conservative government cancelled the palliative care secretariat that had been established and was beginning to do work in terms of a national vision. We had an all-party committee that came back and said we needed a strategy.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633544">However, what we are seeing across the country is a real patchwork of services. I believe there are only four provinces that even have a provincial strategy in place for palliative care. In some areas we see incredibly strong resources. For example, downtown Regina and Saskatoon have extraordinary services, but even in a city as big as the GTA or Montreal, we are dealing with a patchwork. In rural areas, sometimes it is almost non-existent.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633545">There is a belief that somehow palliative care is done with volunteer money. That does not really understand its importance.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633546">Let us look at the delivery of services in the rural regions. What I have seen in my own region is that when families do not have access to proper support, it causes immense stress to the patient. Many times I have dealt with this when people have come to my office. I have heard about an elderly woman trying to bathe her husband who is dying of cancer, but who has not been identified for palliative care. They are trying to get home support workers, who do extraordinary work.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633547"> The overall vision is that this is a palliative issue as opposed to just someone who needs home support. Too often the person ends up in the emergency room waiting for a bed. It is the locum or the emergency room doctor who has to tell them that they are actually suffering from an incurable illness, which can be very traumatic.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633548">I have seen families almost torn apart because of the pressure. Someone has to stay home with the loved one. We know that in at least a quarter of the cases, Canadians have said that they have had to miss upwards of a month of work or have used personal savings to look after a loved one who has an incurable condition.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633549">In areas where we have good palliative care, we can actually save about $8,000 to $10,000 per patient because they are not then being cared for in emergency wards and there is not the struggle to find beds, because there has been a whole approach.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633550">In the rural northern Ontario region that I represent, the provincial allocation for palliative care for a region of more than 100 kilometres with three hospitals and about 20 communities is $70,000. What can $70,000 buy when one is delivering health care, when one has to do the audits and to ensure travel? That is not to say it is the only money.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633551"> The province, through its LHINS, has a pain management program, but it is not under the palliative program but through someone else, another organization that could be 200 kilometres or 400 kilometres away. They do good work as well, but it is not integrated. We have personal support workers, but they are not necessarily working under the palliative network.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633552">To get that $70,000, the local organizations are supposed to raise $25,000. So they are already having to bring forward about a quarter of the money themselves. Meanwhile, there are numerous other agencies, all delivering fragments of the service, but if those fragments were put together into a cohesive whole there would be a better health outcome.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3633553">We can learn from each other in different parts of the country. This is a really important opportunity. We need to talk to the medical front line, the social workers and the people who are dealing with the sick and the aging. They understand that if we work together and worked on the models that work, we could learn from each other and deliver better outcomes.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="20">(1820)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3633554">There is clearly a need for this program across the country. Palliative care is excellent in some regions and virtually non-existent in others.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633555">Quality palliative care means integrated care: home care, social services and medical care to help improve people's health, emotional and psychological support and support for families.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633556">Currently, less than 30% of Canadians have access to quality palliative care. That is why New Democrats are asking the other parties to work with them to support this vision for a pan-Canadian strategy to help families and individuals facing this situation and to implement similar models in both rural and urban areas.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3633557">I believe this is a moment when all parliamentarians can come together in a positive way. We all have to face the death of a loved one. We have all faced it. We all have our own stories. These are moments in the life of a family that is at a crossroads, the closing of one chapter and the opening of another.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633558">I remember when my grandfather died and the responsibilities that were transferred, the cultural roles, the leadership roles, and the spiritual roles that people play in a family when someone leaves and the next generation has to take those on. That is an extraordinary moment in the life of a family, but if it happens in a crisis unit, if it happens in an emergency ward, if it happens because some of the family members have to be out working in the oil patch and cannot get back to be there, the sense of guilt and anger can tear families apart or seriously damage the spiritual vitality of a family or community.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633559">When there is a better model out there, one that saves money and that ensures better access for people, I think it is incumbent upon us to say, let us embrace this model and let us show what dying with dignity in 2014 should be about, to ensure that we have everything in place around the person, around the loved ones, around the families so that they can make that transition and so that we, as their family members and loved ones, will also be able to make that transition to the next level of our own communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633560">I am hoping to get the full support of the members of Parliament. I am certainly counting on the members who did the extraordinary work on the palliative care committee. I think this is something on which we can all agree. I would ask my colleagues to work with us to support this motion and then begin to push for its full implementation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633561">From this Parliament, it is incumbent upon as well to begin this discussion in Canadian society. This is a common sense solution that is staring Canadians in the face. This is a discussion that we need as Canadians. It is a positive discussion. It is a discussion that brings people in to talk together, as opposed to leaving people on the outside.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633562">I would like to think that out of this motion can begin a positive discussion across this country.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Certainly in the Conservative caucus, the member from Kitchener has done extraordinary work on this. In our caucus, the member from Windsor led the work on this committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633573">I have to admit that I meant to attend that committee, and I did not. I was busy with ten thousand other things, but at that time, I thought palliative care was something that was good and that existed. It was when I saw that Perram House had shut down, and I began to look around and realized that there are huge gaps, that I went back and read the report that had been sitting on my desk. I saw that parliamentarians from all different parties had really looked at these issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633574">This is one of the great things about being able to bring forward private member's initiatives. Sometimes in the hustle and bustle and the political back and forth, some of these very important issues that front-line people are calling for, are asking for, are dropped along the way. These are moments when, as parliamentarians, we can bring them back into the House and say that there are people who are looking to us to do something.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633575">If we as the Parliament of Canada said that we believe in an integrated vision of palliative care, it would certainly set a conversation at the provincial level and at the communal level.

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Albas" id="8293777"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="194842" Type="18">Mr. Dan Albas (Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Treasury Board, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3633576">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to Motion No. 456, sponsored by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170184" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation>. Palliative and end-of-life care are important topics, and I would like to recognize the member for <Affiliation DbId="170184" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> for raising these concerns in his motion. </ParaText><ParaText id="3633577">I would like to briefly share an experience from my riding of Okanagan—Coquihalla that I believe is relevant to the motion we are discussing here today. Back in the early 1990s, Andy Moog, a citizen from Penticton and a former elite NHL Stanley Cup winning goalie, started up a unique charity golf tournament known as Moog and Friends. Each summer, some of the NHL's finest players, coaches, general managers, and media personalities gathered to raise funds for a very important cause. That cause was the Moog and Friends Hospice House, which provides palliative and end-of-life care for loved ones in my community.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633578">Today, Mr. Moog and many of his friends are enjoying retirement, but the legacy of the Moog and Friends Hospice House lives on to serve the community. This hospice house, and the unique care it provides, was a first at the time for our region. It has made what can be some of life's most challenging moments more bearable, so that those we love can pass on with dignity and greater understanding. That is why Motion No. 456 is an important one and will become even more important as our population ages.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633579">Indeed, we know that by 2020, Statistics Canada projects that there will be 330,000 deaths in Canada each year. By 2041, that number will rise to more than 432,000. These statistics demonstrate the need for palliative care services right across the country. We also have to recognize that providing these services will require significant resources. In fact, since 2006, our government has invested more than $43 million to support palliative care research and has delivered $3 million to the Pallium Foundation of Canada to support training in palliative care for front-line health care providers. Our government understands the very difficult challenges faced by Canadian families when they are caring for aging loved ones who need palliative care.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633580">We must also recognize that ultimately it is our partners in the provincial and territorial governments who have the lion's share of responsibility for managing and delivering health care, including palliative care. That does not mean that as a federal government we cannot provide support to the provinces and territories in these efforts. </ParaText><ParaText id="3633581">The question that is most often raised, and at times debated, is how best we can provide that support. One way to improve end-of-life care is to integrate palliative care through the health care system, in all settings where people spend the end of their lives. Integrated care systems, for which our government delivered $3 million in economic action plan 2011 to support the development of this, has shown promise. This funding supports the development of community-integrated palliative care models, fostering collaboration among all jurisdictions and the health care community. The $3-million investment to the Pallium Foundation of Canada announced recently by the <Affiliation DbId="194628" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> will also support training in palliative care to front-line health care providers.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633582">The motion before the House today highlights the need for integrative models of palliative care and the need to encourage Canadians to discuss their wishes for end-of-life care. It also focuses on taking into account the geographic, regional, and cultural diversity of Canada, both urban and rural. The federal initiatives from our government to date, implemented through non-governmental organizations with expertise in palliative care, align with a number of the components that the member for <Affiliation DbId="170184" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> raises in Motion No. 456.</ParaText>

These services are provided directly by the federal government or managed in conjunction with the provinces and territories.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633588">This government's contributions, which I have just described, complement services provided by provinces and territories.

This framework will complement flexible, integrated approaches to palliative care developed by provinces and territories with relevant stakeholders; and,” and second, replacing paragraph (c) with the following: “aligns with the goals of improving access to high quality home-based and hospice palliative end-of-life care for all Canadians; supporting family caregivers, particularly those balancing paid work and caregiving responsibilities; improving the quality and consistency of home and hospice palliative end-of-life care in Canada; and encouraging Canadians to discuss and plan for end-of-life care”.</ParaText>

Hedy Fry (Vancouver Centre, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3633602">Mr. Speaker, I applaud the hon. member for bringing forward this very important motion. I want to suggest, however, that we add one amendment to the motion. I know that we are not allowed to do that, but I would like to include after the word “integrated” the word “comprehensive”. It is because it is not only about integrating a system of care we are talking about. It is about looking at all the elements of care that are necessary. The hon. member, in putting forward what is a broad-based recommendation, leaves it open for some of us to talk about areas that we feel are missing. The word “comprehensive” would encompass all of this.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633603">The whole concept of palliative care is not a simple thing that happens when one's life is ending or when one is dying and wants to die a good death, as the word <I>euthanatos</I> means. What we are talking about here is the issue of palliative care as part of a continuum of care that should be divided, actually, into three parts. The three parts we want to look at have to be divided into the different levels of the end of life.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633604">First, there are seniors ending their lives with chronic diseases who need to or can live in their homes. While those chronic diseases may eventually speed up their deaths, the point is that they are able to take care of themselves in their homes with a system that facilitates good home care.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633605">The second part is a diagnosis of impending end-of-life, when the patient needs assisted care but is not yet dying.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633606">The third piece we need to look at is the final piece, which is when the person is dying, which is when palliative care fits in.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633607"> Currently, palliative care and any of these levels of care are not considered to be core, mandated levels of care under the Canada Health Act. Therefore, they are spotty at best. We have some places where there is a wonderful integrated, comprehensive system in place and some places where there is practically nothing at all. That is why the motion is important.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633608">The thing to remember is that 26,000 seniors die each day in Canada. Only a small percentage of them have the ability to get the kind of care they need as they lead up to and eventually end up needing palliative care.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633609">The parliamentary committee, in 2011, had some excellent recommendations. As we develop a model to implement this, we can look at them, because some were quite comprehensive.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633610">We need to talk about an integrated, comprehensive system, because we need to look at some areas that are not mentioned in the motion. One of them is support for caregivers. It is not only support for caregivers to take time off work so that they can look after the chronically ill and/or diagnosed patient. We need to have respite in place for caregivers. If caregivers are the only people on whom the care falls within the family, and they do not have an opportunity to take some time off to deal with some of the stress and emotional pain they have while they are looking after a loved one, we will not have fitted the system out properly. We would only consider burdening the actual family member with all the care and compensating them for it. Respite and time off is an important part of any support for caregivers.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633611">I also want to talk about a piece that is not fully mentioned but that is really important. That is the issue of housing. I think we have forgotten that housing is a determinant of health and that housing is a core part of any kind of comprehensive and integrated system. As we get to the home care part, for instance, when people may be able to stay at home when they reach a particular point in their chronic disease and can still take care of themselves with help, we need to ask if we can retrofit homes. Do we have a program that would retrofit and renovate homes so that it would be possible for the person to live that period of their time at home? </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="45">(1845)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3633612">Are we looking at new housing strategies through which people, once they get to the assisted living part, can move into an assisted living centre with all of the higher-level care that they may need, and eventually move on to palliative care in a facility particularly dedicated to palliative care?</ParaText><ParaText id="3633613">The important piece that I would like to add is the comprehensive piece. We must talk about housing if we are to achieve that full system, and we must talk about respite if we are going to achieve proper support. </ParaText><ParaText id="3633614">Pieces are missing. I support the intent, but there are pieces missing. For instance, we know that only 10 out of 17 medical schools in the country have any teaching program at all to train physicians in palliative care. Most physicians get something like a 10-hour course in those 10 universities, so most physicians are not really equipped to deal with palliative care.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633615">The important thing is to look at how we educate and train caregivers, whether they are nurses, physicians, or others, to deliver appropriate care and to understand all of the pieces involved in end-of-life care, including the spiritual pieces, the cultural pieces, the emotional pieces, and all of that. We do not yet have that kind of training in place. That is one of the pieces that would be needed as we look at a comprehensive, integrated model of care.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633616">The idea of helping people to develop a plan is very important. I think of the Canadian Medical Association meeting last summer. The doctors all talked about the fact that they did not do this very well, that they needed to start reaching out to their patients to talk about some sort of plan, and that patients need to understand that they can reach out to their physicians, or, if they are in a community care setting, to the nurse practitioners, the home care nurses, or whoever is looking after them to be able to discuss this matter openly.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633617">The ideas here are excellent. I just wanted to add some elements to it that I think would strengthen it. That is why I wanted the word “comprehensive” in it. The mover of the motion may not agree with me, but after the word “integrated”, I would add “comprehensive” so that we deal not only with the health care system but also with other systems that would support it with palliative care.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633618">That is what I had to say.

As the member outlined, it is about establishing a pan-Canadian palliative care, end-of-life care strategy. It is about providing more support for caregivers, improving the quality and consistency of home and hospice, palliative, end-of-life care, and actually encouraging Canadians to discuss this issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633630">When we look at our health care system, sometimes we think that things do not affect us. However, I think it is very true to say that we have all had experiences where a family member, a close friend, or maybe a neighbour, has been in the situation where they are approaching the end of their life, and it becomes a real struggle in terms of where they might be and what kind of care they might receive.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633631">Palliative care and end-of-life care, whether in a hospice or at home, is something that is really very deep. It is very meaningful. For many years, we did not talk about these issues. We do not like to talk about death or think about what happens to us at the end.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633632">However, we should talk about it. More than that, we need to have public policy around it. That is why this motion is so important. It shows us that across the country there are incredible examples of palliative care.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633633">However, it is very patchy. For example, in my community in East Vancouver, the St. James Cottage Hospice, located in an historic building in Burrard View Park, is an amazing place. It is like a home. It is a place where people feel comfortable. It is where they have dignity. They do tremendous work there.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633634">Every year in our community in East Vancouver, there is a festival of lights. The houses are dressed up with Christmas lights, and people vote and give donations in the street adjacent to the palliative care home. The money goes to palliative care. The whole community comes together to express itself. It is a wonderful initiative undertaken.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633635">We need to state in this debate that, unfortunately, there are big gaps in the system. I was very proud last Monday when the NDP unveiled a very important document based on 18 months of consultation across the country about health care in Canada.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633636">We went out and talked to Canadians. We did our homework about what needs to be done to improve and sustain our public health care system. It is a wonderful document, and I would certainly urge people to go check it out on the NDP website.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633637">In the public forums and consultations we held across the country, one of the key issues people put forward, based on their own experience, their own need about what they know needs to happen, was that we need better home, long-term, and palliative care. That came through to us again and again.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633638">I would like to quote from that document we put out a week ago.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633639"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Canadians want to see home care, long term care, and palliative care recognized as essential medical services just like treatment in the hospital. These services are not luxuries, and they need to be fully accessible, whatever a patient’s income, and provided at the same high quality and standards wherever they live.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3633640">That quote has come to us in our document because of what people told us. We are very cognizant that palliative care is part of a bigger issue that needs to be critically addressed in this country, which is the issue of continuing care of which palliative care is a part.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633641">We do need to have home care. We do need to have long-term care. Again, it is very spotty across the country. Some provinces do well, others do not. People who live in smaller and remote communities have very little access.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633642">The reliance we have on acute care facilities, the over-reliance because there is nowhere else to go, people end up in hospital, as the member for <Affiliation DbId="170184" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> pointed out. For people to die with dignity, they need to be in an appropriate place where there is support, resources, the right kind of medication to relieve pain, and the right kind of guidance, whether spiritual or emotional, from their family.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="50">(1850)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3633643">These are probably the most important times in anyone's life, yet these services really do not exist across the country in the way they should.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633644">I really want to make the point today that in debating this motion, let us recognize that it is linked to a bigger issue around our health care system and that we have to make sure that the federal government shows leadership on this issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633645">There are many reforms needed in our health care system. This is one of them. Today, I met with a group, the Parkinson's Association. I have met with many other groups. They all say the same thing, which is that the burdens financially and sometimes emotionally of caregiving create enormous stress for the family where people have to leave work, quit their jobs, and take out loans.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633646">This is not what should be happening. There are incredible groups out there who have been calling for this kind of pan-Canadian end-of-life care strategy for so long. I think it is fantastic that we had an all-party parliamentary committee working on this issue.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633647">Now that we are actually having this debate, we have our own power here to vote, one by one. We have the power to say that this motion has merit, that it is legitimate and has all of this groundwork, all of this homework, behind it. It is non-partisan. It crosses all political lines. We have this opportunity in the House to vote for this motion and to say to the government that this is the will of Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633648">It is based on what we hear from our constituents. It might be based on our own experience. I certainly have my own experience. My partner of 24 years died of cancer just before I was elected. We were very fortunate that we had palliative care at home under the B.C. health care system.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633649"> I cannot imagine what that experience, as hard as it was, would have been like if my partner had been in a hospital, just in a ward or maybe in the hallway. Being at home and having people around him who loved him and cared for him on a daily basis and having the professional help and support that we needed was critical to how we went through our own process of grieving and losing someone that we loved so much.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633650">That is just my experience, and this is manifest in hundreds of thousands of people across the country every day, so I want to say, let us pay attention to the motion. Let us look at how it is putting something forward that is real and legitimate. Let us put aside partisanship. Let us recognize the good work that has been done on this issue by an all-party committee. Let us unite, come together, and say to the government that we want to pass this motion so that the Government of Canada will establish a pan-Canadian palliative care strategy.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633651">I would also like to move an amendment.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633652"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">I move that the motion be amended by replacing the words “Canada; (b) respects the cultural, spiritual and familial needs of Canada's first nation, Inuit and Métis people” with the words “Canada, as well as Canada's first nation, Inuit and Métis people; (b) respects the cultural, spiritual and familial needs of all Canadians”.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I personally believe we can accomplish more in private members' time with motions than we do with small changes to legislation. This one is a bigger picture issue and it is very important that it has been brought forward.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633657">As we know, the senior population in Canada is growing. In 2012, there were more than five million seniors in Canada, which is about 15% of the population. Based on what I have read, I believe that number may even double within the next 15 to 20 years. That is because of advancements in medicine and other factors that allow Canadians to live longer. </ParaText><ParaText id="3633658">It is important for us to be ready for that aging population, even though many seniors today are very active in their older years, and that is very important. A few weeks ago I presented a bill on obesity, diabetes, and staying active, not just for youth but also for seniors. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633659">Today's motion before the House draws some attention to the role of family caregivers. A Statistics Canada study revealed that family and friends provide 80% to 90% of the care for ill or disabled persons in our community. It is important to note that one-quarter of these caregivers are seniors themselves and are helping other seniors, whether their own spouses or family members. It can be expected that this will only increase with the increase in baby boomers. </ParaText><ParaText id="3633660">At this point, I know other speakers have made this motion a bit of a personal piece, and I would like to take this time to do that on two fronts. One is that we are talking about hospice care. When I was on the council in the City of Burlington in 1999, it came to our attention that there was a need for palliative care and hospice care. Through the leadership of the mayor at the time, Mayor MacIsaac, and the Rotary Clubs of Burlington, they came up with a plan. By 2002, we had a 10-bed hospice, or maybe 12-bed, which was also able to exist because of the generosity of a number of Burlingtonians including the Carpenter family, which was the lead donor on the Carpenter Hospice, as we know it today. That was in 2002. As of last check, it has served over 1,600 individuals who lived there in palliative care since its inception. I have been very proud to be part of the council that developed that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633661">The other area that is very important to me and my family is that I am very fortunate to have relatively long life in my family. In fact, my grandmother Wallace will be celebrating her 97th birthday in a week and a half, or so. We are very proud of grandmother Wallace. Her mother, Granny Lasalle, lived to 100 years old; so I might be here for a while. In fact my Granny Lasalle worked on Parliament Hill. She was a housekeeping employee and, in a picture I have seen, she is cleaning the Prime Minister's offices. </ParaText><ParaText id="3633662">We have been very fortunate. I want to wish my grandmother a very happy birthday. What is important is that she lives with my uncle and aunt. She has lived with a number of my dad's brothers over the years, and they are providing the care and support for her. We are very fortunate that Grandma Wallace is in really good health, but that is not the same for every family.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633663">I lost another grandmother in the fall who was age 96. She was living with my parents for about five years. Therefore, I completely understand, from a personal perspective, the need for family members and the responsibility that goes along with end-of-life care and palliative care and care for seniors. The role that my Uncle Jack and Aunt Marilyn are playing for Grandma Wallace and that my Uncle Miles and his wife Cathy played for my grandmother Wallace in past years and that my own parents, Len and Cassie Wallace, played for my Grandma Gray make a big difference in the quality of life for them as the end of years come closer.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="00">(1900)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3633664">I am hoping, based on the 10% rule, that my Grandma Wallace will outlive her mother by about 10%. That will make her about 110 by the time she needs palliative care, and I am looking forward to that. That also means I will be the member of Parliament for Burlington until I am 120. Hopefully, I will have moved on before then.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633665">Our government recognizes the critical role that many Canadians play in caring for family and friends with health conditions or disabilities, in addition to balancing their own work lives and family responsibilities. In 2012, over eight million individuals, or about 28% of Canadian adults, provided unpaid care to family members or friends with a long-term or terminal health condition, disability, or aging needs. Of these caregivers, about 67% provided care to a senior. Most often, family caregivers providing end-of-life care were caring for their own parents, as was happening in my own family. About one out of every 13 caregivers has provided this type of care in the last year alone.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633666">Our government recognizes that while family caregiving is both beneficial and rewarding, it can also be very difficult. Take, for instance, the negative health impacts experienced by caregivers, particularly among seniors caring for other seniors, and those caring for individuals suffering from very difficult diseases like Alzheimer's and other related dementia. As these individuals become less capable of taking care of themselves, caregivers assume the responsibilities for their personal care. This gradual loss of independence often creates additional levels of stress and anxiety for the person with the disease, the caregiver, and the caregiver's family.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633667">We have also supported research that is helping inform decisions as to how best to help the families and caregivers of people with chronic and progressive conditions. Indeed, since 2006, we have invested more than $650 million in research in areas related to aging, including more than $100 million in 2012 alone. Ongoing research, supported by our government, is also filling gaps in knowledge about rates of neurological conditions in Canada, including Alzheimer's disease. It is also looking at the efforts of individuals with these conditions, their families, and other caregivers.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633668">Supporting Canada's caregivers presents an increasingly complex challenge, in part because of the very needs of each recipient and because of the unique situation of each caregiver. Responding to such needs typically involves the engagement of several partners at all levels of government, with the support of community-based organizations and employers. In addition to the above-mentioned research, the Canadian government has provided a variety of supports for unpaid family caregivers. For instance, economic action plan 2014 announced our intention to launch the Canadian employers for caregivers plan. This plan would engage employers to identify and implement cost-effective and promising workplace practices that better support employed caregivers.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633669">I appreciate the motion from the member opposite to highlight and bring attention to the issue of palliative and end-of-life care, the important role of family members and family care for those in need, for the other opportunities that need to be addressed in working with other partners, including the provinces, and making sure that we have these services for the growing senior population we will have over the next number of years.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The last run is set for the end of April. The timing of the announcement was especially bad for tourist businesses such as lodges and outfitters, many of whom were attending trade shows and drumming up clients for the summer.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633673">Shortly after that, I asked the <Affiliation DbId="194617" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> why the government would abandon the businesses, property owners, and communities along the line and was told the government is not in the business of giving money to profitable companies like CN.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633674"> While that statement could be challenged vigorously, time constraints will spare the government an itemized list that would surely begin with $1.3 billion in subsidies for the profitable oil and gas sector.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633675">What is missing from the hard line being taken is any recognition of the economic cascade this will create. This is not a clear-cut case of saving $2.2 million. Every dollar invested in passenger rail creates economic activity along the line and supports a variety of business ventures.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633676">Although there is no formal impact assessment, some of that work has been undertaken by the stakeholder group of communities, businesses, first nations, fur managers, property owners, outdoor enthusiasts, and passenger rail supporters who are working to save passenger services. They prepared a basic level of assessment that estimates the current regional economic impact of ACR passenger service at $20 million a year. Put another way, every dollar invested by the government creates $9 of economic activity.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633677">These findings are consistent with an independent study undertaken by Tourism Ontario in 2013 on the economic impact of sport fishing in Algoma.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633678">The subsidy was lost when the government removed the rural component from the former rural and remote passenger rail subsidy. The rationale for classifying the ACR as rural rests in the government's opinion that the communities and businesses along the line can be accessed by road. This is flawed thinking.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633679">The government is assuming the industrial roads are safe and reliable for public use, but most of these are secondary roads and many are not even open during the winter. Also, people using them at their own risk may fall into an insurance vacuum should something happen while travelling on them.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633680">The community of Oba is a good example. People there will be effectively isolated without passenger service. Oba has no access by public road. The only option is an industrial road that people can be denied access to at any time, and there is no guarantee that the road will be maintained either.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633681">For those reasons alone, the ACR should receive the remote line subsidy, and if the government had done a proper assessment, we would not be having this discussion.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633682">One thing this experience has done is to further shatter the myth of a seat at the table ensuring a constituency's good fortune under any government. This has a huge effect on the community of Sault Ste. Marie, which is represented by a member of the governing party. Many people in that community are having a difficult time believing the member has been working diligently behind the scenes on their behalf when he appeared to have been caught off guard by CN's announcement. He followed up by claiming “We didn't know how CN was going to respond” and indicated it would be his preference that CN continue the service at its own expense.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633683">That amounts to wilful ignorance and wishful thinking. CN has no obligation to subsidize passenger services. It is far more appropriate for the government to maintain the subsidy, which is in keeping with other public transportation investments it is making.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633684">It is also wishful thinking to believe that industrial road access is a guaranteed option as well. Those roads are maintained for the benefit of companies and can be abandoned at any time.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633685">With that in mind, and with so many businesses, jobs, communities, and property owners left twisting in the wind, would the government do the right thing and find the money to support passenger services on the Algoma Central Railway?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The line transfer and discontinuation provisions in the Canada Transportation Act are aimed at encouraging retention of rail lines, where it makes sense to do so, by giving other railways or other interested parties the opportunity to continue railway operations.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633688">The decision to cancel the Algoma Central Railway passenger rail service between Sault Ste. Marie and Hearst was a business decision made by CN, the owner of the railway.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633689">At one point in time, some communities along the Algoma Central Railway relied upon the rail line as their only means of access. However, other transportation options, including local highways, are now available on a year-round basis. As a result, the ridership on the service has declined by 37% in recent years, to less than 5,000 riders annually.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633690">With regard to the situation in New Brunswick, CN will continue to be responsible for maintaining the rail line, to ensure that service is not disrupted while the discontinuation process is under way. If CN does not complete the discontinuation process for the portion of the track in New Brunswick, VIA Rail, an independent crown corporation, will be responsible for making decisions about its passenger rail services.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633691">This government provides significant funding to support passenger rail services. In 2013-14 alone, the Government of Canada provided VIA Rail, a crown corporation that operates independently of the government, with $305 million to provide passenger rail services to Canadians. Since 2007, the government has also provided VIA Rail with nearly $1 billion in capital funding to support projects, such as station upgrades, railcar refurbishment, and track improvements.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633692">The government will continue to monitor these two situations, but ultimately believes that railways are commercial enterprises and that its role is to encourage commercial solutions to address rail line discontinuance.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The irony is not lost on the people affected by this.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633694">However, there is still a chance to do the right thing for the lodges and outfitters that will be most affected by the end of ACR passenger services. Unfortunately, it is expected that the loss of service will force some of these outfitters out of business altogether.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633695"> I have received a great many messages from tourists as well, who have travelled from all over the world to ride the rails to these remote destinations.

These adjustments would be phased in over seven years. This plan would provide appropriate compensation for cheese producers and would cost the federal government virtually nothing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633705">The Conservative government promised to compensate large and small Canadian cheese producers. It must therefore consider proposals that would allow it to keep that promise.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3633706">However, to date, the government has not put forward any concrete proposals. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170121" Type="2">Berthier—Maskinongé</Affiliation> moved a motion in this regard that the government was very quick to ignore.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633707">The motion calls on the government to reveal details without delay related to the compensation that will be paid to dairy and cheese producers; provide for an implementation period for the agreement that is as long as possible to allow producers to adapt; put an end to the circumvention of tariff quotas and the misclassification of products at the border; maintain high quality standards by imposing the same production and processing requirements on imported products; and commit to provide support for commercialization. Nonetheless, there has been nothing but silence from the government.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633708">Canadian cheese producers need to know immediately what compensation they can expect to get from the federal government, particularly since no money was set aside for this sector in the most recent budget, even though there was money set aside for other industries, such as the automotive industry and the fishery.</ParaText>

In 2012, the industry generated approximately $20.6 billion in both farm gate and processor sales. That has translated into thousands of jobs for Canadians while helping to support a stable economy. Our government continues to support an innovative Canadian dairy industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="3633714">Under Growing Forward 2, we have increased that investment to $12 million to continue the cluster's great work over the next five years.
