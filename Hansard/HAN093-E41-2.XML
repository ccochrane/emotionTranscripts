					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Dechert" id="8390023"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="194837" Type="18">Mr. Bob Dechert (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3755379">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today in favour of Bill <Document DbId="6277291" Type="3">C-10, an act to amend the Criminal Code (trafficking in contraband tobacco)</Document>. This bill proposes amendments to the Criminal Code to create a new offence of trafficking in contraband tobacco and to provide minimum penalties of imprisonment for persons who are convicted for a second or subsequent time of this offence.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755380">To help reduce the problems of trafficking in contraband tobacco, the government committed, among other things, to establish mandatory jail time for repeat offenders of trafficking in contraband tobacco in its 2011 election policy platform. This bill would fulfill that commitment.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755381">Indeed, the bill prohibits the possession for the purposes of sale, offer for sale, transportation, delivery, or distribution of a tobacco product or raw leaf tobacco that is not packaged unless it is stamped. The terms “tobacco product”, “raw leaf tobacco”, “packaged” and “stamped”, have the same meanings as in section 2 of the Excise Act.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755382">The penalty for a first offence would be up to six months imprisonment on summary conviction and up to five years imprisonment if prosecuted on indictment. Repeat offenders convicted of this new offence in cases involving 10,000 cigarettes or more, or 10 kilograms or more of any other tobacco product, or 10 kilograms or more of raw leaf tobacco would be sentenced to a minimum of 90 days on a second conviction, a minimum of 180 days on a third conviction, and a minimum of two years less a day on subsequent convictions. Overall, the proposals represent a tailored approach to the imposition of mandatory minimum penalties for serious contraband tobacco activities. The bill proposes minimum penalties only in cases where there are certain aggravating factors present.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755383">The contraband tobacco market first became a significant issue in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the taxes on cigarettes were increased sharply to raise government revenue and deter individuals from taking up or continuing smoking. During that period, more and more legally manufactured Canadian cigarettes destined for the duty-free market began to make their way back to the Canadian underground economy. The high retail price of legitimate cigarettes made the smuggling of cigarettes across the border a lucrative illicit business.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755384">The RCMP and Canada Customs seized record quantities of contraband tobacco. The RCMP was also engaged in investigating this illegal activity at its source. These investigations eventually led to negotiated settlements involving certain tobacco companies, a landmark agreement signed in July 2008 that set a combined total of $1.15 billion in criminal fines and civil restitution, to be paid by the companies over 15 years. Also, two guilty pleas entered in April 2010 by JTI-Macdonald Corp. and Northern Brands International resulted in $550 million in criminal fines and civil restitution. </ParaText><ParaText id="3755385">By the mid-1990s, this type of smuggling activity largely came to an end, and there followed a period of relatively low levels of illegal activity related to contraband tobacco.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755386"> However, the illicit tobacco market in Canada has rebounded in recent years, rising rapidly since 2004 to become an acute problem once again. Today, the illicit manufacturing, distribution, and selling of contraband tobacco products is different from that of the 1980s and 1990s. Now illegal activity in Canada is primarily connected not to the diversion of legally manufactured products but to illegal manufacture, although it also includes to a lesser degree the illegal importation of counterfeit cigarettes and other forms of illicit tobacco from abroad.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755387">Organized crime plays a central role in the contraband tobacco trade in Canada, and that means that this illegal activity is linked with other kinds of crime. Most of the organized crime groups across the country involved in the illicit tobacco market are also active in other forms of criminality. What we have in Canada is a situation where illegal contraband tobacco products are sold to children in schoolyards, because they are less expensive. It is a way of getting young people hooked on nicotine and tobacco, which is obviously very injurious to their health and contrary to Canada's long-standing commitment to reduce smoking in our society. </ParaText><ParaText id="3755388">They also allow those people who sell cigarettes individually or in small quantities to students to get them onto other drugs as well. The organized crime groups such as the Hell's Angels and other motorcycle gangs will provide them with tobacco now, and then maybe in a few months' time, will slip in a marijuana cigarette, and then maybe sell them some more of that and perhaps other drugs too. The profits from contraband tobacco fuel all that other criminal activity. That is one of the reasons we need to be vigilant and we need to pass this bill to crack down on the trade in contraband tobacco.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3755389">The problem is further complicated by the international aspects of the illicit tobacco trade. For example, some of the illegal manufacturers that supply the Canadian market are on the U.S. side of the Akwesasne Mohawk territory, which spans the borders between Quebec, Ontario, and New York State. The contraband tobacco market is driven largely by illegal operations in both Canada and the United States. The provinces of Ontario and Quebec have the highest concentration of contraband tobacco manufacturing operations, the majority of the high-volume smuggling points, and the largest number of consumers of contraband tobacco.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755390">There are approximately 50 contraband manufacturers operating on first nations territories in Kahnawake, Quebec, and the Six Nations reserve in Ontario. As I mentioned earlier, there are also manufacturers on the American side of the Akwesasne Mohawk territory, which is uniquely located at the confluence of borders between Ontario, Quebec, and New York State, giving rise to jurisdictional and legal challenges between federal, provincial, and state laws.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755391"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Organized crime networks are exploiting First Nations communities and taking advantage of the jurisdictional and politically sensitive relationships between those communities, governments and enforcement agencies.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3755392"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> The 2012 National Threat Assessment on Organized and Serious Crime prepared by the Criminal Intelligence Service of Canada has identified 58 organized crime groups that are involved in the contraband tobacco trade throughout Canada, 35 of which are currently operating in Central Canada. These criminal networks re-invest profits from the manufacture and distribution of contraband tobacco in other forms of criminality, including the trafficking illicit drugs, firearms and human smuggling. Furthermore, the RCMP reports that violence and intimidation tactics continue to be associated with the contraband tobacco trade.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3755393">
								<Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> It is clear that the illicit tobacco market is dominated by criminal organizations motivated by the lure of significant profits and relatively low risks. Enforcement actions are therefore directed at increasing the risks associated with contraband tobacco activities: dismantling illegal manufacturing facilities, disrupting distribution supply lines, apprehending key figures, confiscating conveyances such as trucks and boats, and seizing the proceeds of crime. These actions have the dual goal of disrupting the illicit flow of tobacco and weakening the organized crime groups involved in the production, distribution, smuggling, and trafficking of contraband tobacco.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755394">Contraband tobacco is a serious threat to our communities if left unchecked, and organized crime will continue to profit at the expense of the health and safety of Canadians and government tax revenues. </ParaText><ParaText id="3755395"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Recent intelligence indicates a rise in counterfeit tobacco products entering the Canadian market as well as the diversion of some raw leaf tobacco grown in southwestern Ontario to illegal manufacturers in and around first nation territories in Ontario and Quebec. These illegal products are then transported through nation-wide networks for sale to consumers as a cheaper alternative to legitimate tobacco products, thereby making them more accessible to youth.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3755396"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The Government of Canada recognizes that contraband tobacco smuggling has become a serious problem in the last several years. Certainly, Canadians want to be protected from offenders involved in these contraband tobacco smuggling operations, which threaten their safety and that of their families as well as the health of our youth. They also want to be protected from organized crime associated with contraband tobacco activities...</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3755397"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Protecting society from criminals is a responsibility this government takes seriously. Accordingly, this bill is part of the government's continued commitment to take steps to protect Canadians and make our streets and communities safer.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3755398"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> Canadians want a justice system that has clear and strong laws that denounce and deter serious crimes, including illicit activities involving contraband tobacco. They want laws that impose penalties that adequately reflect the serious nature of these crimes...</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3755399">This bill, in my view, achieves that.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights worked extremely hard on this file. I enjoyed working with my colleague on it. Contraband tobacco is not a straightforward topic.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755401">However, I am wondering about something. The opposition we heard in committee came from first nations chiefs who are concerned because they were not consulted about this, despite the fact that they are often the ones who are most affected by tobacco smuggling. It sometimes happens on their land.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755402">According to clause 4 of the bill, the legislation will come into force on a date to be fixed by order in council, so I am wondering if the parliamentary secretary knows if his government intends to use the time it has before the bill's implementation to have those extremely important conversations with first nations in the areas that are plagued by tobacco smuggling. It is unfortunate that it would be happening after the fact, when it should have happened beforehand.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I do appreciate her hard work on the justice committee, and I enjoy working with her on that committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755404">The member will remember that when we were at committee, there were a number of representatives of native communities from across Canada, especially those straddling the borders between Ontario, Quebec, and New York.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755405">They told us about the illegal activity that is brought into their communities by organized crime groups that are largely not first nations-related groups. They take advantage of the people living there. They drag them down this road into illegal activity with the promise of easy money.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755406">We were told by one chief that his Mohawk community had a very proud tradition of working in the construction industry, in high steel, in places like New York City and other places around the United States. Unfortunately, the lure of this easy money from smuggling illicit tobacco products across the St. Lawrence River was dragging his people away from that legitimate proud tradition and bringing them into areas of criminality.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755407">We listened very closely to what the leaders had to say. This bill has been crafted largely in consideration of their views. We will always take the opportunity to listen to first nations communities about how this bill should be implemented.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Lamoureux" id="8390049"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170750" Type="2">Mr. Kevin Lamoureux (Winnipeg North, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3755408">Mr. Speaker, contraband cigarettes are indeed a serious problem in many different regions in Canada. In fact, in certain areas it does fuel a significant amount of organized crime because of the amount of revenue that can be generated.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755409">The negative impacts of that organized crime are fairly profound and have a serious impact on many communities throughout Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755410">My question is for the minister. Has the department done any sort of any analysis, or can it provide us with any information in terms of the degree to which contraband cigarettes are on the market in different regions of the country? Does the minister have that type of information? If so, I would personally be quite interested in receiving it. If he could make it available, that would be greatly appreciated.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It comes from various sources, the government as well as other NGO organizations.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755412">I am sure the member has heard similar stories in his constituency. In my constituency, in Mississauga, there is a secondary school called Erindale Secondary School. There was an analysis done of the tobacco butts lying around the school yard and just off the school property where young people smoke. It was found that a significant percentage, more than 30% of those cigarette butts, came from illegal contraband tobacco. </ParaText><ParaText id="3755413">That indicates that across Canada there is a problem with very cheap cigarettes being sold to young people in very small quantities that they can afford, maybe four or five cigarettes at a time. It gets them started down that road, which is a very serious health risk to young Canadians across Canada.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Being a former parliamentary secretary to the minister of public safety and dealing with the aboriginal community, I know many of them are concerned about the guns, drugs, and gangs that are involved in this.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755416">As the <Affiliation DbId="194837" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice</Affiliation> knows, they use the young people in the aboriginal communities as a shield.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755417">This legislation will be welcome. I am wondering if the parliamentary secretary could elaborate a little on where the penalties will go. We see illicit growing of tobacco. Recently there have been large seizures of leaf. Certainly that is the beginning of the process.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755418">I am wondering whether the parliamentary secretary has some information for us.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

He has worked very significantly on it over the last several years.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755420">There are a number of new offences under the bill. There will be a penalty for the first offence of up to six months in prison on summary conviction, or up to five years imprisonment if prosecuted on indictment. This is for both the transportation and sale and offer for sale of illegal tobacco products. For repeat offenders, those convicted on indictment could be sentenced to a mandatory minimum penalty of 90 days on a second conviction, 180 days on a third conviction, and two years less a day on subsequent convictions after that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755421">What we found in the past, under the Excise Tax Act, is that the trade in illicit tobacco products was simply an administrative statutory offence, and therefore the perpetrators received fines. They just made that the cost of doing business. They would pay the fine and continue to do it over and over again.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755422">This is a very tailored set of penalties that increases with each subsequent offence. That will target the people who are involved in the continual trade in illicit tobacco products, and those would largely be criminal organizations from outside the native communities, not in the native communities.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

If people use tobacco, it will be smuggled.

The ministry of health has one in particular. We have introduced new warning labels on packages of cigarettes and little cigars. These labels have a phone number for a national quit line and a website address for people who want help in quitting. </ParaText><ParaText id="3755426">We have banned flavoured little cigars, which were targeted toward youth. In my constituency, I have seen young people go into convenience stores and try to buy the little banana-flavoured or cherry-flavoured cigars. That is a way of getting them hooked on tobacco, making it sweet and palatable to them. </ParaText><ParaText id="3755427">We renewed the federal tobacco strategy in 2012 for five years, and Health Canada will continue to work on tobacco control initiatives that aim to preserve the gains made over the past 10 years to continue the downward trend in smoking prevalence.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Boivin" id="8390064"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170299" Type="2">Ms. Françoise Boivin (Gatineau, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3755428">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House to speak to Bill <Document DbId="6277291" Type="3">C-10</Document>. We supported it at second reading, but we had quite a number of concerns, particularly in terms of its compliance with the charter because it includes mandatory minimum penalties.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755429">I am also concerned about the process that led to Bill <Document DbId="6277291" Type="3">C-10</Document>. The government did not consult the partners in the federation, namely the provinces, the territories and the first nations. We were therefore determined to carry out a thorough study in committee. That is what I hoped for.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755430">The committee did a good job. It heard witnesses in various capacities talk about the scourge of contraband tobacco. I will have no trouble convincing everyone in the House that contraband tobacco is a scourge, period.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755431">However, there might be a little hypocrisy around this issue in our society. Even as the government tries to control tobacco and fight contraband tobacco, it is raising taxes on tobacco and making a lot of money that way. That hypocrisy became entrenched over the years, and now it is complicating the issue. Add to that the ancestral rights of first nations peoples to manufacture tobacco, and the issue gets very murky.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755432">The Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights had some good meetings. It heard from excellent witnesses, including chiefs of first nations. I did not hear a single first nations chief express support for contraband tobacco to the committee. Nevertheless, the chiefs were very realistic. They insisted on protecting their traditional rights to produce and grow tobacco as they have done historically within their territory. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755433">That being said, they are also aware that contraband tobacco, which is often part of organized crime activity on their land, has the lure of easy money for their young people. It is a vicious circle because there is a great deal of poverty on first nations lands that tends to get ignored, and then we are surprised when the black market takes hold there. This does not help first nations chiefs to provide their people on their land with something worthwhile.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755434">I have already done so in person, but since we have the time, I would like to publicly thank my NDP colleagues who served with me on the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights and who may not get the chance to speak to the bill in the House. They did exceptional work. I particularly want to thank the NDP deputy justice critic, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170505" Type="2">La Pointe-de-l'Île</Affiliation>, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170131" Type="2">Brome—Missisquoi</Affiliation> and the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170669" Type="2">Beaches—East York</Affiliation>. They contributed a lot to this file through their personal experience in their own part of the country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755435">What is more, we proposed an amendment. I am still sad that the government did not see fit to approve the amendment that we proposed to respect R. v. Gladue. That decision calls on the courts, when sentencing, to consider the extenuating circumstances of the accused when the accused is from the first nations, especially considering that there are mandatory minimum sentences. That is the requirement that resulted from that decision, but according to lawyers at Justice Canada, Bill <Document DbId="6277291" Type="3">C-10</Document> will take precedence over R. v. Gladue. We will see whether there are more appeals. I suspect there will be. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="30">(1030)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3755436">If one of the people arrested is a first nations member, it is very possible that the defence will make use of some of the arguments in the Gladue ruling. I think it would be wise to say that this did not trump the facts in the Gladue case.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755437">True to form, the Conservatives are so terrified of adopting any amendment other than their own, and I find that very unfortunate. They may be rapped on the knuckles once again, as they have been in the last four or five major Supreme Court decisions. I feel like a mother who says “I told you so”, and I am a little tired of that. That is how I have felt for the past three years.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755438">The opposition members are trying to do their job. I listened to the prayer recited by the Speaker at the beginning of the sitting. He asked Parliament to make good laws. I believe that is what we are trying to do both in the House and in committees.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755439">Suffice it to say that the amendment was rejected. The mandatory minimum sentences will apply to repeat offenders, where a high volume of contraband tobacco is involved, and so my concerns about the sentences have been allayed. I still have no guarantee that the bill complies with our charters because the government does not see to be too worried about that. When we weigh out the two issues, public protection and contraband tobacco, which affects our children, we realize that this is extremely important.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755440">The NDP has always taken the problem of contraband tobacco in Canada seriously, and Bill <Document DbId="6277291" Type="3">C-10</Document> has not changed that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755441">I am going to digress for a moment regarding Bill <Document DbId="6277291" Type="3">C-10</Document>. When it was introduced in the House, we were told it was an absolute emergency, but it has been around for a long time now. If memory serves me correctly, the bill passed second reading in November. It was then referred to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, where we worked very diligently and quickly. Throughout the month of December, until the adjournment, we worked on this legislation. As soon as we came back after Christmas, in early February, we proceeded to clause by clause. What is intriguing is that the bill then fell into oblivion. We never heard about it again. Then, this week, I noticed we were going to debate Bill <Document DbId="6277291" Type="3">C-10</Document>. There are many numbers in my head, such as <Document DbId="6277291" Type="3">C-10</Document>, <Document DbId="6503398" Type="3">C-32</Document> dealing with prostitution, <Document DbId="6496356" Type="4">C-587</Document>,<Document DbId="6519131" Type="4">C-590</Document> and others. All these bills seem to deal with justice.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755442">When I saw my name tied to Bill <Document DbId="6277291" Type="3">C-10</Document>, I wondered what the bill was about. It reminded me of the good old days when I was pleading before the court. We would prepare a case and arrive in court with witnesses. Unfortunately, for some very serious reason, the other side would ask for a postponement. We had prepared the case and met with witnesses and we were more than ready. We would return to our office, back at square one, and tell ourselves that we would wait for the next time. However, we sometimes had to wait a year or a year and a half and start all over again. Clients would sometime wonder why we were billing new hours. The answer was that we had to refresh our memory.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755443">This is the impression I get with Bill <Document DbId="6277291" Type="3">C-10</Document>. I had to review the whole file because, in the meantime, we had debated several other justice bills and a number of issues that are now in the annals of the House. The government does not have to tell us this is urgent. The Conservatives seem to move into high gear at two very specific times: during the week preceding the holiday season and during the last two or three weeks before the summer recess. During these periods, we are incredibly productive.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3755444">I almost wish we could change the calendar so that it could be June all year long. Canadians across the country would be amazed at our productivity.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755445">This week in the House, we debated Motion No. 10, which supposedly seeks to increase our work hours. It seems we are not working enough, but if that is the case, I am not sure why I am tired. In any event, I was listening to some of my colleagues, and their argument was that we had passed only nine bills.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755446">What is fascinating is that about 15 bills will likely be passed in two weeks. One has to wonder if that means that we are being more productive or less democratic because we will have less time to speak to these bills and fewer people will have the opportunity to speak on each topic. I think the answer is obvious.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755447">Bill <Document DbId="6277291" Type="3">C-10</Document> is a good example. It has been sitting on someone's desk since February when it could have been passed quickly the week after it came back from committee. There were no formal or serious objections that would have prevented the bill from passing. This bill could have been passed by now.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755448">These are important points to raise. I would never let anybody tell me that we are not working hard on these issues because we take them very seriously. Sometimes, we rise to speak to a bill at second reading to raise some of our concerns. There is no denying that we are concerned about this bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755449">I know that the National Coalition Against Contraband Tobacco is made up of many people who benefit from tobacco sales. I was not born yesterday, and I see where their interests lie. In their testimony, some police forces also told us that they will need resources. This is an extremely important message that came out of the committee's examination of Bill <Document DbId="6277291" Type="3">C-10</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755450">The first nations have their own to-do list for their territory. We need to stop making cuts to first nation police services. If Bill <Document DbId="6277291" Type="3">C-10</Document> gives the police new tools by adding an offence to the Criminal Code that existed only under the Excise Tax Act, then from now on all police forces can begin dealing with contraband tobacco. However, we have to give them the resources they need. We need police officers on the front lines.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755451">Some witnesses also told us that contraband was increasingly coming from countries other than Canada, for example, China. This is an issue for border services, and this agency will need resources. All we ever hear about on the news and here in the House is successive budget cuts being made to border services. How do we expect this agency to combat the large-scale smuggling that organized crime groups are conducting through well-organized networks? </ParaText><ParaText id="3755452">This is not just about tobacco; it is also about arms and drug smuggling. It is all connected. The government is always a bit hypocritical, since it introduces bills and claims to want to fix everything, but it does not provide tools for the people on the ground so that they can do their jobs properly. I find that worrisome. Nevertheless, all of the witnesses we heard from in committee made the facts clear, regardless of their reasons.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755453">For example, I know that the Canadian Convenience Stores Association wants us to put an end to contraband tobacco. When contraband cigarettes are available, no one buys cigarettes at the convenience store. The association does not want to put an end to tobacco use; it wants to put an end to illegal competition in its industry. The association is right. We must stop being hypocritical. If we decide that tobacco is a legal industry in Canada, even though we know that it kills, these stores should be able to happily sell it and make money legally.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3755454">That is why I really liked the question my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170748" Type="2">Abitibi—Témiscamingue</Affiliation> asked the parliamentary secretary. She asked him if there were ways other than Bill <Document DbId="6277291" Type="3">C-10</Document> to eliminate the scourge of tobacco. She and I both know that it is not easy to quit smoking. She can share her personal experience with that. In my case, I have been chewing Nicorette since 1999. People in the committee had quite a laugh when I told them that. In December, I was proud to tell them that I had quit Nicorette, but unfortunately I have to admit to everyone that I have started up again. It must be the Conservatives' fault I guess, because either I chew Nicorette or I get even more aggressive than usual. That is what I thought: everyone is eager to recommend that I chew Nicorette. That is what I do. Maybe I will stop one day. My point is that it is a constant battle.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755455">We tell kids not to smoke, but tobacco companies attract them with all kinds of products. I know that is why I started smoking when I was young. It was cool. We thought we were so smart. Had I known how bloody hard it would be to quit 30 or 40 years later, maybe I would never have started. Young people know that now.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755456">There are other ways, as my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170748" Type="2">Abitibi—Témiscamingue</Affiliation> said. There has to be a concerted public health effort, not just changes to the Criminal Code. There has to be a concerted effort to raise people's awareness that this product kills. That is what the warnings on cigarette packs say: this stuff kills, causes all sorts of problems and places a heavy burden on our health system. We have to do everything in our power to bring tobacco use rates down as quickly as possible. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755457">We will tackle the issue of contraband tobacco immediately. I hope that it will help, but I am not convinced that it is the silver bullet or that it will solve every problem. I want to reiterate that for the <Affiliation DbId="194837" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice</Affiliation>. This bill will come into force on a date to be fixed by order in council. That is better than when we are sometimes told that the bill will come into force within 30 days of the bill being passed, which means that it applies immediately. I feel that it is of the utmost importance that the government use the time before the bill comes into force to sit down and talk with the first nations that have a considerable number of issues with and concerns about the bill. It is not that they support contraband tobacco. However, as Gina Deer, Chief of the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake, said:</ParaText><ParaText id="3755458">
								<Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Bill C-10 proposes an infringement on our inherent aboriginal and treaty rights pertaining to the production, transportation, sale, and regulation of tobacco products.</QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755459">If that is how Chief Deer perceives Bill <Document DbId="6277291" Type="3">C-10</Document>, a government representative needs to sit down with the chiefs to correct that perception. I think that the government's vision has to be explained, and first nations and the government need to discuss it as equals. The government did not have the decency to do that before it introduced the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755460">We are supporting this bill, even with its flaws. I am still waiting for the Conservatives to introduce a perfect bill. I do not think it is going to happen any time soon. That said, the committee did a fine job. I would like to thank my committee colleagues for their work, and I would also like to thank the witnesses who came to enlighten us on this subject, which is not always straightforward.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755461">I appreciate the work being done by police, in particular. They do not have an easy job. As I said earlier, when we talk about contraband tobacco, the discussion often turns to other types of contraband or illegal activities such as organized crime and dangerous individuals. Police officers are putting their lives in danger every day. We must appreciate their work, but we also need to give them the tools and means to do their job. They have all been critical of that.</ParaText>

It would give powers to police in different jurisdictions to tackle the issue. Just on that front, it is an immense step.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755468">That said, it will not solve everything.

Back in 1988, when I was first elected to a provincial legislature, budget after budget would come through with increases to cigarette taxes. There is a strong correlation: the higher the cost of cigarettes, the more people are inclined to quit smoking. Often I would hear, “The government is increasing the price of tobacco. I'm going to quit smoking. This is my last pack. I'm going to save that money that I would be spending in taxes and put it toward something else.” We did see significant decreases. </ParaText><ParaText id="3755495">Contraband cigarettes have been counter to the government's attempt to decrease the population's involvement in purchasing tobacco and smoking.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755496">At one time when I was first elected I would argue that the government used tobacco tax as a revenue generation. It was all about money coming in. What we find is that smoking costs society far more than we could ever possibly generate in terms of tobacco tax. We do not get anywhere near as much money in taxes as we spend on things such as health care. In Manitoba alone, hundreds of millions of dollars is spent annually on health. Nationwide, we are probably talking well into the billions of dollars in terms of the negative impacts of tobacco.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755497">If we take a look at those negative impacts today, the issue goes beyond health. There are public safety issues, such as organized crime, which has gotten hold of this issue and is making millions of dollars of revenue every year to be used for other aspects of crime. It is used to complement things such as drugs, prostitution, and all sorts of other issues that are brought into this whole area.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755498">We can and should be doing more. These elements of public safety, of health, and of lost revenue have all had a profound impact on Canadians from coast to coast to coast. Therefore, when we take a look at this bill, what we see is a step in the right direction. There are some concerns that we have with respect to judicial independence, for example, but there are other issues and as such we could have done so much more.

I do want to conclude with a few brief remarks to highlight the fact that we in the Liberal Party are prepared to support the bill as reported today. We do have some concerns in relation to it, but all in all it is a significant step forward. </ParaText><ParaText id="3755818">Having said that, I want to highlight an important issue that I believe is of concern to people in my constituency of Winnipeg North and a number of regions of the country where there are a lot of similarities. That is the importance of looking at the broader impact of contraband and how it is used within criminal organizations.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755819">Contraband has been found to be highly profitable by organized crime and gangs. As a result, this has added to the problems. Contraband seriously impacts communities throughout Canada, and I want to emphasize how important it is that we deal with it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755820">Contraband cigarettes are just one part of it. Selling illegal drugs, and prostitution are other elements that provide a major source of revenue for gangs and organized crime. We need to do more to deal with this problem, and we are looking to the government today to take some action. We have a piece of legislation in front of us that would hopefully have an impact. I suspect it will to a certain degree. We are asking the government to do even more to deal with the issue of contraband cigarettes and other sources of revenue that are feeding organized gangs.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755821">I will conclude by talking a bit about the demand for contraband, which I made reference to at the beginning of my remarks. The demand for contraband tobacco has increased over the years because of the organized crime element and its ability to make huge profits. One of the reasons that organized crime can make the profits it makes is because of the level of taxation on cigarettes.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755822">As government has recognized, in order to discourage people from smoking, it has increased the cost of cigarettes. As a result, we have seen significant growth in the purchase of contraband cigarettes through the underground and illegal activities. We need to work with the different stakeholders, the provinces and others, to look at ways to beat this serious issue.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755823">I want to pick up on my final point of cigarettes as a whole. We recognize that smoking is detrimental to the health of our citizens. I would therefore suggest that we do more to educate people and encourage them to make the decision to quit smoking, specifically our young people. We should support our students in the best way that we can. We should ensure that anti-smoking programs are included in our public education system. </ParaText><ParaText id="3755824">We need to see stronger leadership coming from Ottawa. Ottawa needs to deal with the different stakeholders who could play a role in minimizing the use of tobacco, whether it is the health element or the tax element. All of this has to be taken in an all-encompassing fashion, so that Canada will be able to deal with the serious issue we are facing today on a number of fronts, recognizing that the bill attempts to deal strictly with contraband tobacco. </ParaText>

Governments of all political stripes have attempted and have not done anywhere nearly as well as they could have done. </ParaText><ParaText id="3755831">That is the reason we in the Liberal Party say that we need to have more leadership coming from Ottawa, working with the different provinces, because it is not just Ottawa that is going to resolve the problem. it is going to take a lot more than Ottawa dictating or changing a law. It is going to take a lot more effort, and that means consultation and working with the different stakeholders. There is a lot to be lost if we do not take action on this issue.</ParaText>

That is the reason there is more of a need to take a holistic approach in dealing with this.

There are some aspects of the legislation that raise concerns.

We know how hard it is to stop smoking. If more people stop smoking and fewer people start smoking, demand decreases. The law of supply and demand affects smuggling. That is why we have to take a more comprehensive approach to this problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755853">I am particularly pleased to rise because when I spoke to the bill when it was introduced in the House, I announced to my colleagues that I had just quit smoking.

							<ParaText id="3755854">To grasp the comprehensive nature of an anti-tobacco approach, we must understand that a number of ministers are concerned. The <Affiliation DbId="194613" Type="4">Minister of National Revenue</Affiliation> is one of them since we cannot collect taxes on contraband. The government cannot collect that money. Moreover, since smoking generates huge costs in the health sector, a portion of the government's revenues is used to deal with this problem. Therefore, if we cannot have these revenues, we are obviously affected. This makes one minister affected by this issue. </ParaText><ParaText id="3755855">For her part, the <Affiliation DbId="194628" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> is responsible for implementing anti-smoking initiatives and approving drug products to help people stop smoking and warnings on cigarette packages. She can act in a number of areas. That makes two ministers affected by this issue.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755856">As regards international trade, a lot of contraband products cross borders. Therefore, it is in that department's interest to be involved. </ParaText><ParaText id="3755857">At the same time, the <Affiliation DbId="194622" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> must supervise the tobacco industry, which is still legal and which is incurring losses because of contraband tobacco. The <Affiliation DbId="194622" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> can be much more proactive in encouraging people to stop smoking. We now have four ministers involved.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755858">As for the <Affiliation DbId="111560" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture</Affiliation>, he must work with tobacco producers, particularly aboriginal communities, whereas the <Affiliation DbId="194629" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> is responsible for offences, fines and jail sentences related to contraband tobacco. Of course, these ministers are also affected. So is the <Affiliation DbId="194614" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness</Affiliation>, since the issue involves the security of the borders where tobacco is smuggled into the country. This now makes six ministers. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755859">The <Affiliation DbId="191408" Type="4">Minister of Aboriginal Affairs</Affiliation> is affected, of course, because criminal organizations sometimes use aboriginal communities. Under the Constitution, and because of how things are organized, these communities are particularly involved. In fact, since there are higher than average smoking rates in aboriginal communities, the <Affiliation DbId="191408" Type="4">Minister of Aboriginal Affairs</Affiliation> must introduce ways to help aboriginal people reduce their tobacco consumption. He must also provide police resources and financial means to help them take action in their communities. This is another minister involved. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3755860">The <Affiliation DbId="194607" Type="4">Minister of State for Small Business</Affiliation> is also involved because it is small businesses, like convenience stores, that claim to be losing money.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755861">I am no expert here, but I count eight ministers who could easily be involved, not just in the issue of contraband tobacco, but in the issue of tobacco use in general. If we want to take action on contraband tobacco, we need to take a comprehensive approach.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755862">The <Affiliation DbId="194629" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> did not adopt a comprehensive approach. He introduced a bill containing several measures that will have an impact, but since he refused to sit down with aboriginal communities to discuss this, he probably did not take the time to sit down with his counterparts to adopt a comprehensive approach. </ParaText><ParaText id="3755863">The minister introduced a bill with some effective measures, but this bill could probably have been more complete and comprehensive.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755864">The NDP will support the bill, but we recognize that the Conservatives could have decided to take a much more comprehensive approach.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755865">Not only did the minister not take a comprehensive approach to this bill, but he also took a long time to introduce it. It should move through quickly enough, unless the government decides not to put it back on the order paper. He could have acted much more quickly and globally. He did not, and that is unfortunate.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755866">Tobacco is a real scourge. Some people start smoking very young. This is embarrassing to admit, but when I quit smoking, I realized that I had smoked my first cigarette at the age of eight. That is rather unusual. I was still in elementary school. There were two elementary schools and I was still in the smaller school with grades one, two and three when I started to smoke. By the age of 12, I was smoking every day. I quit smoking at the age of 29. I am now just 30, which means that I have spent more of my life as a smoker than a non-smoker. That is rather unusual.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755867">That is why we cannot talk about contraband tobacco without having a comprehensive approach. Often it is young people who are targeted by this contraband because they cannot buy cigarettes legally. Obviously they are going to try to find other ways or people who are not concerned about their age and will sell them the product. Those people know full well that young people are particularly drawn to these products. </ParaText><ParaText id="3755868">What is more, contraband cigarettes are a lot cheaper. Sometimes a bag of 200 cigarettes are sold for the same price as a pack of cigarettes at the corner store. Young people do not have the same financial means as adults and are more likely to turn to these products. Some organized crime groups recruit young sellers. They tell them that they can smoke for free, by keeping a bag of cigarettes and selling the rest.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755869">This is a serious problem. That is why if we want to tackle such a big problem, we cannot compartmentalize it. We cannot tackle contraband tobacco, tackle consumption, tackle consumption among young people and tackle the safety of contraband products without taking a comprehensive approach. Unfortunately, the government did not want to do that with this bill. That is what I find unfortunate. If the government had taken a global approach, then we probably would have had a much more comprehensive bill.</ParaText>

There has not been much debate about the bill in the House because all of the parties support it. Even more important is the fact that all of the parties are prepared to send the bill to committee.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3755888">As members also know, the short title for the bill is “Vanessa's Law”, in honour of the tragic death of Vanessa Young, who was the daughter of the member for <Affiliation DbId="170498" Type="2">Oakville</Affiliation>. However, this week, I am very sad to say, that member levelled unfounded and partisan comments against the opposition for so-called delaying the bill. Given the prominence of the attacks from the government in question period and the members' statements lineup, it is clear he was doing this with the government leader's full endorsement and encouragement.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755889">The problem is that the only reason the bill was not been sent to committee months ago was that the government House leader did not consider it important enough to qualify for debate. He, of course, sets the agenda for what bills are called and he is responsible for asking other parties to help expedite legislation when he wants to. </ParaText><ParaText id="3755890">At the beginning of December, the bill was tabled in the House. The sad truth is that in the nearly six months since this proposed law was tabled, there have been only 60 minutes of debate in March and then a couple of hours of debate this week. In fact, in the March discussion, we moved on to another bill before the third party even had an opportunity to speak.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755891">Questions need to be asked about why the bill has not been brought forward to committee, and here is a good example. With almost an hour left in government orders, the government has asked to move forward to private members' legislation. It could have brought Bill <Document DbId="6365510" Type="3">C-17</Document> forward for debate at this time. </ParaText><ParaText id="3755892">The problem is that we have never been asked, not once at any of the meetings we have had with the government House leader. One cannot say that one does not have agreement if one has never asked the question.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755893">The government House leader actually has my cellphone number, although it is telling to note that I do not have his. I have been meeting with him regularly, and we have told him very clearly that Bill <Document DbId="6365510" Type="3">C-17</Document> can to go committee without time allocation. The reality is that he has not asked me because he seems to want to play political games rather than deal with the fact that we want some debate on the bill before it is sent to committee. </ParaText><ParaText id="3755894">Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I am asking you to rescind that notice of time allocation given under Standing Order 78.3 because the government House leader simply has never asked us the question in the many opportunities he has had in the last few months.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755895">We do not want to set a precedent around the use of time allocation, and the Conservatives have used it so abusively already. Sometimes they have asked us the question, but in this case, the question was never asked. The government seems to want to play political games with this bill rather than work with the opposition so we can improve upon it in committee and move it back into the house.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I would like to take time to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="170657" Type="2">Selkirk—Interlake</Affiliation> for initiating this bill as Bill <Document DbId="6251824" Type="4">C-478</Document> in February 2013. The member was unable to forward the bill at that time and is now excluded from doing so. I am more than willing to champion this bill as it has merit and would provide guidance and accommodation to our judiciary to further protect victims of violent crimes.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755905"> Today my bill, Bill <Document DbId="6496356" Type="4">C-587</Document>, would amend section 745 of the Criminal Code to provide that a person convicted of an abduction, sexual assault, and murder of the same victim in respect of the same event or a series of events would be sentenced to imprisonment for life without eligibility for parole until the person had served a sentence of between 25 years and 40 years, as determined by the presiding judge after considering the recommendations, if any, of the jury.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755906">My bill is targeting sadistic murderers. Sadistic criminals convicted of such crimes are never granted parole, so  the hearings are unnecessary and extremely painful for the families to endure. This bill is modelled on Bill <Document DbId="4668958" Type="3">C-48</Document>, passed in 2011 with the support of the NDP. It amended the Criminal Code with respect to parole inadmissibility for offenders convicted of multiple murders. Because of Bill C-48 receiving royal assent, Travis Baumgartner, the former armoured car guard who shot four of his co-workers, three of them fatally, in a robbery on the University of Alberta campus in June 2012, was sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for 40 years.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755907"> My bill seeks to extend the parole ineligibility period for those convicted of abduction, heinous acts of sexual assault, and murder of an individual, as did Bill <Document DbId="4668958" Type="3">C-48</Document> for multiple murderers. My bill would spare families and loved ones of murder victims from being re-traumatized by repeated parole hearings.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755908">Families of those whose lives have been lost or severely damaged may go through many emotions, namely shock, horror, physical and emotion pain, nightmares, heartbreak, sorrow, grief, stress, sadness, anger, rage, and may end up distrusting of our social values. To have to go through this over again at a parole hearing is cruel, to say the least.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755909"> The seriousness of offences set out in the bill would ensure that the parole ineligibility period would only be applied in cases of the murderer's lack of remorse and if the act of violence was a heinous and brutal act of violence or sexual assault ending in murder. Allowing for judicial discretion and not a mandatory minimum sentence would ensure charter compliance.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755910"> Bill <Document DbId="6496356" Type="4">C-587</Document> is focused on preventing the unnecessary agony and trauma of parole hearings for victims' families. The bill would spare the families of victims from having to attend unnecessary parole hearings every two years after the offender's 25-year sentence expired. Making murderers ineligible for parole for 40 years could save families up to eight unnecessary parole hearings.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755911">I want to empower our courts with the ability to increase parole ineligibility when sentencing individuals who have abducted, sexually assaulted and killed our innocent and vulnerable, from the current 25 years up to a maximum of 40 years. Currently, any Canadian convicted of both first and second degree murder is given an automatic life sentence. However, the provisions rarely have put an offender in jail for longer than 25 years, the time at which first degree murderers are eligible for parole.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755912">Darlene Prioriello, age 16, was murdered May 6, 1982, by David James Dobson. She was abducted by Dobson at a Mississauga bus stop. She was raped and mutilated, and suffered a slow, agonizing death. Dobson was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison on April 11, 1983. He was scheduled for the first parole hearing in March 2007, but he rescheduled it, causing the Prioriello family much agony since it had to prepare for the emotional day over and over again. In April 2007, he was denied parole.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3755913">Daryn Johnsrude, age 16, was murdered on April 21, 1981, by Clifford Olson. Olson applied for parole in 1997, 2006, and 2010, and was swiftly denied parole every time. Daryn was brutally raped, tortured, and killed. He was one of 11 victims murdered by Olson; three of the victims were boys and eight were girls. All were between the ages of nine and 18.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755914">Olson, while in prison, tried to cause the victims' families as much suffering as he could by sending graphic, detailed letters to Daryn's parents, explaining what he had done to their son. He also once sued Daryn's parents for calling him a pedophile. Olson also tried to sell memorabilia online, and made a dozen videos of how to abduct children.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755915">This constant reminder of Olson's cruelty made it very difficult for the families to have any kind of peace or closure. Daryn's mother said, “The only thing more bizarre than Olson's antics is the system that gives him a right to a parole hearing.” </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755916">Janet and Karen Johnson, aged 13 and 11, were murdered by David Shearing, a.k.a. David Ennis, in August 1982, as were their grandparents and parents. He had parole hearings in 2008 and 2012, and was denied parole each time.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755917">Linda Bright, aged 16, was murdered in 1978 by Donald Armstrong. He has applied for parole hearings numerous times, and then has always cancelled at the last moment. The most recent time was in March 2012.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755918">This bill is all about saving the victims' families from having to go through the agony of attending unnecessary and traumatic parole hearings. My bill would give the judge the discretionary powers to make a recommendation to the jury and also in the sentencing process to award a period of parole ineligibility that would be increased from 25 years up to 40 years.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755919">In my riding of Okanagan—Shuswap, I met with Marie Van Diest, mother of Taylor Van Diest of Armstrong, B.C. Her daughter was murdered in October 2011 by Matthew Foerster of Cherryville. He was found guilty of first degree murder. Taylor, 18, was found beaten with fatal head wounds by the side of railroad tracks, hours after going missing on Halloween night 2011.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755920">When my bill is passed, it will assist families by not having them deal with the re-enactment of what happened to their loved ones over and over again, having to face a loved one's killer, to read what was done to their loved one and how their loved one died. </ParaText><ParaText id="3755921">A re-enactment of the offence in court is traumatizing for victims' families as it is. To attend parole hearings is very painful, in fact cruel. Family members have to once again find the pain they have tucked away and bring it back to the surface, and relive it and think about what was done.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755922">If a convict is denied parole, the victims' families will once again have to be prepared to do it again at another parole hearing. They should not have to go through this, but they do. They present their victim impact statements to try to ensure the convict is not released. The scheduling of parole hearings is emotional torture.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755923"> I ask members of the House to pass the bill. Families have already been victimized once. Having to attend parole hearings causes families of victims a lot of suffering and does not provide them with any closure. They should not have to relive their tragedy.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755924">My bill would save families from going through parole hearing after parole hearing. We must save families from having to endure the cruel punishment of reliving their horror. Sharing a victim impact statement, revealing raw pain and memories is unimaginable.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755925">Let us not fool ourselves. The Supreme Court of Canada, in R. v. Shropshire, stated “parole ineligibility is part of the "punishment" and thereby forms an important element of sentencing policy”.</ParaText>

We congratulate him on his promotion. However, we need to revisit Bill <Document DbId="6496356" Type="4">C-587</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755955">I am tempted to reread my improvised speech from the last time, because my view on this bill has not changed. It has some good points. Some might say the NDP should be satisfied, because it always calls for the continued exercise of judicial discretion, and that is in the bill. </ParaText><ParaText id="3755956">Indeed, it is always a good idea to leave it up to the court to decide whether someone should be eligible for parole after 25 years, or only after 40 years. This judicial discretion is definitely an improvement on many other bills introduced by the Conservative government. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755957">That said, one can read a bill and wonder whether it will achieve the goal stated by the member. During oral question period, the parliamentary secretary said that this legislation would greatly reassure victims. When we work on these issues, we always try to put the interests of the victims first.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755958">However, because of the legal context, the laws that we rely on and the charters that we must abide by, we must ensure that our legislation will successfully meet the tough challenges that lie ahead.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755959">The government should have learned some lessons from the recent decisions of the Supreme Court, including the one on the Senate, which it lost by a count of 8-0; the Summers decision on April 11 on pre-sentencing credit, which the government lost by 7-0; and the Khela decision on prisoner transfer, which it lost by a count of 8-0. I do not include the Nadon ruling, because no legal principle is involved in this case. Still, the government suffered a 6-1 defeat. It also lost 8-0 in the Whaling decision on early parole. Again, we ask the government to pay attention to existing laws.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755960">When I rise in the House in my capacity as justice critic for the official opposition, I do not do so to irritate Canadians or my Conservative colleagues who are introducing bills. In fact, I have actually supported an impressive number of their bills. I have recommended that my caucus colleagues support certain government bills and even some private members' bills introduced by Conservative members.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755961">In this case, the government would have victims believe that this bill will solve their problems. However, victims do not really have a problem with the sanctions. Let me make that clear right away: the problem with Bill <Document DbId="6496356" Type="4">C-587</Document> does not have anything to do with the sentences per se.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755962">Since we are talking about extremely serious crimes, such as abduction, sexual assault and murder, we are certainly not talking about minor offenders, such as people who rob convenience stores. We are talking about hardened criminals like Clifford Olson and Paul Bernardo. Everyone, including the victims, knows that these offenders are in jail for life. Is that clear enough? When they get a life sentence, that means they are in jail for life.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755963">However, our legal system, our charter and our international conventions allow offenders to appear before the Parole Board of Canada.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3755964">The board will not free these people if they pose a risk. The public is not at risk just because an offender has been released. The problem—and the hon. member may be right about this— is that it is painful for families and victims to have to relive the unforgettable horror. Even if offenders cannot appear before the Parole Board for 40 years, victims will still be reliving the horror of their experience as though it happened yesterday. One does not just forget about these things overnight.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755965">That being said, let us think about what would happen if the bill were to pass. The judge would ask the jury if it had any recommendations to make in the case of vicious murder.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755966">I would just like to say, incidentally, that I am also concerned about the fact that these three crimes must all have been committed. A murder can be vicious even though the victim was not sexually assaulted or abducted. I think it is unfortunate that the focus is being placed on one type of offence when many other offences could easily fall into the same category.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755967">Let us take the Bernardo case, for example, where the case was proven. I am talking about proving the case, but I would remind members that in the Bernardo case, they did not have to prove rape, kidnapping, or anything else. The murders themselves were enough to result in a life sentence. Under this bill, all three will have to be proven. I already see the impact that this will have on trials under way and on what the crown will have to prove. In my opinion, in an attempt to make life easier for families in terms of attending parole hearings, the member is unwittingly making things more difficult when they need not be. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755968">None of this may happen because the judge could instead hand down a 25-year sentence. He may not feel comfortable with a longer sentence. We are already waiting for Supreme Court decisions to find out if sentences of more than 25 years—such as three consecutive sentences of 25 years, where the person is sentenced to 75 years in prison—are legal in our Canadian system under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. There are still some Supreme Court decisions to come. The government may be surprised once again, and that will affect all these cases. </ParaText><ParaText id="3755969">Let us imagine that the jury recommends to the judge that there be no parole for 40 years. That means that there will be an appeal and the parties will go to court. Will that be considered unusual punishment under the charter? There are some concerns about this.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755970">I asked the member the question earlier because, in my opinion, this provision was not included in Bill <Document DbId="6251824" Type="4">C-478</Document>, which was introduced by our colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170657" Type="2">Selkirk—Interlake</Affiliation>. Bill <Document DbId="6503398" Type="3">C-32</Document>, introduced by the government, does contain provisions to make life easier for victims. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755971">There are ways to make sure that victims do not suffer as they would if they had to go back before the Parole Board. There are some who do not want to go to the hearings, but there are some who need to go, for the sake of their sanity, to say their peace before the board. I fully respect that. However, I believe it would have been better to do that with Bill <Document DbId="6503398" Type="3">C-32</Document>. Amendments of this magnitude to the Criminal Code should not be made with a private member's bill, but with a government bill, to ensure there is at least the impression of coherence with this country's fundamental laws.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755972">That is not the case with a private member's bill, whether or not the member is a backbencher. There is no requirement in that regard.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3755973">I have serious concerns about this bill, which unfortunately will not do what it claims for victims. It really would be preferable to bring this forward with Bill <Document DbId="6503398" Type="3">C-32</Document> and to drop Bill <Document DbId="6496356" Type="4">C-587</Document>.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Why are the courts doing this? Is this part of some pan-Canadian conspiracy to thwart the efforts of the Conservative Party? No doubt some across the aisle would embrace that view.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755987">I believe that there are a number of reasons the courts are striking down Conservative legislation, and one relates to due diligence. Many of these so-called tough on crime bills are not properly vetted to ensure that they comply with the charter. The member, in his remarks, indicated that this piece of legislation was charter compliant. I would be most interested to see the evidence and opinion that support that assertion.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755988">It would appear that when Conservative members construct these bills, the last thing they do is assess whether they comply in principle or in spirit with the law of the land: the charter. On that point, I should note that just two nights ago, in this very chamber, on debate on the Citizenship Act, we had the <Affiliation DbId="194611" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship and Immigration</Affiliation> heckling an NDP member and saying that the charter was not a law. </ParaText><ParaText id="3755989">It is not only a law, it is the supreme law of the land.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755990">With respect to this bill, I would invite the hon. member to produce any piece of evidence or documentation that would suggest that the bill would survive a charter challenge. I do not believe he is in possession of any such evidence. </ParaText><ParaText id="3755991">What really matters is showing people that the Conservatives are tough on crime, which is much less effective than being smart on crime. The lack of respect for the charter and for the constitution is very troubling. </ParaText><ParaText id="3755992">I have read Bill <Document DbId="6496356" Type="4">C-587</Document>, and I have been on the hunt for any evidence to support this effort. The bill seeks to increase ineligibility for parole for a conviction that includes a sentence for kidnapping, sexual assault, and murder. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755993">In the last 20 years, according to the Library of Parliament, there have been three cases in Canada that would meet the bill's three elements of kidnapping, sexual assault, and murder. I repeat, in the last 20 years, just three cases would have triggered the provisions of Bill <Document DbId="6496356" Type="4">C-587</Document> had it been in place 20 years ago. In each of those cases, there is absolutely no indication that the judges acted with leniency or that the existing suite of laws are somehow ineffective.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755994">Did the member know that one of these three cases relates to Paul Bernardo, who, because of his designated dangerous offender status, would still have been eligible for parole seven years after conviction? This is just one glaring inconsistency in this bill with respect to the dangerous offender designation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755995">The hon. member's proposal is flawed for other reasons. First, the act would eliminate one of the only incentives for a certain class of violent offender to behave while in prison, thereby making prisons more dangerous for other inmates, and more importantly, more dangerous for correctional officials.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3755996">Just last week the union representing Canada's prison guards went public, urging its 7,500 members to vote ABC, anyone but Conservative. This is what the vice-president of the Union of Canadian Correctional Officers had to say: “These guys have to get out”. He went on to say, “They've done more damage in three years than any government has done in our entire history”. I suppose it is only a matter of time before the Conservatives attack the correctional guards.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755997">The second flaw in the bill is this: The five people convicted of kidnapping, sexually assaulting, and murdering the same victim are already dealt with harshly under Canadian law. Such persons already received mandatory life sentences and are already ineligible for parole for a period of 25 years, since murder in such circumstances is first degree murder. Under the current law, they may also be designated dangerous offenders.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3755998">The third flaw is that this legislation would produce a somewhat absurd result when the code's other provisions relating to parole are considered. Specifically, by increasing a somewhat arbitrary class of murderers' parole ineligibility to a maximum of 40 years, the act would allow these convicts to remain incarcerated without the possibility of parole for up to 15 years longer than notorious serial killers. This anomaly would also extend to those who have committed genocide and crimes against humanity.</ParaText><ParaText id="3755999">Canadian law already deals harshly with the few persons convicted of kidnapping, sexual assault, and murder. This legislation would defy common sense by punishing a specific class of murderers more harshly than serial killers and persons who have committed genocide and crimes against humanity.</ParaText><ParaText id="3756000">The overwhelming lack of an evidentiary basis for the bill is troubling. Again, just three cases over the past 20 years would have been affected by the bill, and in all of those cases, the courts have provided an appropriate and tough sentence.</ParaText><ParaText id="3756001">Should the member appear before a committee to discuss the bill, I would hope that he would consider providing some evidence of facts pointing to the need for this legislation to become law. The member is perhaps in possession of some evidence unavailable to others, and should that be the case, I would most certainly like to see it.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

As he mentioned, this was a bill that I introduced in the first session of this Parliament and because of my appointment as parliamentary secretary, my bill had to be withdrawn, although it did make it to committee. Therefore, I would hope that members will expedite this process so we can get this to committee, where it was a year ago.</ParaText><ParaText id="3756003">Sitting here listening especially to the Liberal member really was disappointing. At no point did he mention the victims, not once. It comes back to this whole ideology of the Liberals about hugging the thug, about trying to protect the criminals rather than protecting Canadians and those victims.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3756004">The title of the bill is “respecting families of murdered and brutalized persons act”. It is work that I started some time ago, and I am very happy that my friend from <Affiliation DbId="170658" Type="2">Okanagan—Shuswap</Affiliation> has taken on this task in the House to ensure that families do not have to go through unnecessary Parole Board hearings and be re-victimized time and time again. Let us ensure we have our hearts in the right place, that they are with the families that have already lost their loved ones and now have to relive the horror of the most heinous criminals who have not only murdered their child or family member, but may have abducted and sexually assaulted them.</ParaText><ParaText id="3756005">The bill would amend section 745 of the Criminal Code. I have to stress that Bill <Document DbId="6496356" Type="4">C-587</Document> is about empowering our courts with the ability to increase parole ineligibility when sentencing individuals who have abducted, sexually assaulted and killed our innocent and often most vulnerable Canadians from the current 25 years up to a maximum of 40 years. It is at the discretion of the courts. They make the decisions on whether to take it up any higher.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3756006">The bill is not about creating stiffer penalties for these sadistic murderers. These depraved convicts do not qualify for parole. We have already mentioned that. The worst case criminals who are in prison, these half dozen individuals who have been alluded to, never make parole. They never ever get out of jail. However, the reality is that families still have to go, every two years, starting at year 23, to hear the tragedy of their child or loved one being abducted, kidnapped, raped, sometimes tortured, and then murdered. We want to put an end to that. The bill is about saving the families of victims from having to go through this agony of attending these unnecessary and traumatic experiences at Parole Board hearings. </ParaText><ParaText id="3756007">Again, we have said that this is not about mandatory minimums. This is about empowering judges and juries in coming to reasonable decisions on parole ineligibility.</ParaText><ParaText id="3756008"> Let us talk about this. Is this constitutional? Does it comply with the charter? The fundamental principle of sentencing is that a sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. The seriousness of the offence as set out in the bill would ensure that parole ineligibility, period, would only be applied in cases where the murderer's moral blame worthiness would be very high for abduction, sexual assault and murder. This would allow for judicial discretion and would ensure charter compliance because it would not be mandatory minimums.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3756009">This goes back to Bill C-48, which used the same principle, protecting Canadians by ending sentence discounts by multiple murderers act. It is important to note that the NDP supported that bill back in 2011. That, in itself, is noteworthy. If it was okay to support it in Bill C-48 back in 2011, I would hope the NDP would support that same principle when it applies to these most heinous criminals.</ParaText>

							</ParaText><ParaText id="3756013">The compliance section that we are concerned about is section 12 of the charter, and by going the route that is presented in Bill <Document DbId="6496356" Type="4">C-587</Document>, providing that judicial discretion makes it charter compliant. That is key.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3756014">As we are saying, this is about the most heinous and horrendous individuals we have in Canada. We are talking about Robert Pickton, Paul Bernardo, Russell Williams, Michael Rafferty, Terri-Lynne McClintic, Clifford Olson, Donald Armstrong, James Dobson, David Shearing and, just recently, Luka Magnotta. These individuals are repulsive in our society. They have committed the most tragic criminal acts on an individual that people could ever imagine, yet there is argument coming forward that they should only have to sit there for 25 years. We know that they sit there longer because they never ever make parole eligibility. They are never put back into society.</ParaText><ParaText id="3756015"> In the sentencing of David Threinen, in 1975, Justice Hughes, who was the judge at the time, stated he should “never again should he be on the streets and roadways of our country”.</ParaText><ParaText id="3756016">If judges already see how repulsive and dangerous these offenders are, then they need to make sure that they are never released back into society.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3756017">When we look at Robert Pickton, he was convicted of multiple murder charges, 25 counts, but unfortunately they were only second degree murder charges. That means 10 years. In 10 years, he can start attending his Parole Board hearings. He will probably never be released, but that means that 25 families are going to be reading victim impact statements at Parole Board hearings every two years, in a matter of a couple of years from now. That is sickening.</ParaText><ParaText id="3756018">One of the reasons I was thinking about this case is that a few years ago I was in my riding listening to the Tori Stafford case. She was the little girl who was abducted, raped, and murdered. It broke my heart. It involved Michael Rafferty and Terri-Lynne McClintic. After they stole her from school and sexually assaulted her, they killed her with a hammer. Terri-Lynne McClintic got a life sentence, in 2010. Michael Rafferty got his life sentence. Tori Stafford's family, in 25 years, should not have to start reliving that murder, that abduction, that sexual assault, every two years from there on in.</ParaText><ParaText id="3756019">We talked about Russell Williams, who abducted, raped, and murdered Jessica Lloyd and Marie-France Comeau. We talked about Clifford Olson.</ParaText>

That is what I will be demonstrating.</ParaText><ParaText id="3756028">As I already mentioned, Bill <Document DbId="6496356" Type="4">C-587</Document> is basically the same as Bill <Document DbId="6251824" Type="4">C-478</Document>, which was not passed by Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="3756029">The first federal ombudsman for victims of crime, Steve Sullivan, did not have a very high opinion of the bill. He felt it was nothing but smoke and mirrors. If someone is charged with  first degree murder, the crown does not generally concern itself with lesser offences. If someone is sentenced to life in prison with a chance of parole after 25 years, this already takes into account that if the person represents a danger or a risk, they will not be granted parole.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3756030">I would also like to point out that criminals targeted in this bill, people like Clifford Olson, Paul Bernardo and Russell Williams, are rare cases.

He murdered 11 people. After serving 25 years in prison, he applied for parole for the first time in 2006. His application was denied, as was his second in 2008. In 2010, his third application was also denied because the court found that he still represented a danger to society. He ended up spending 30 years of his life behind bars, where he died in 2011.</ParaText><ParaText id="3756032">The bill before us will have no real impact on the legal reality in this country. Offenders convicted of abduction, sexual assault and murder are very rare. They are well known because their stories get so much media attention. Bill <Document DbId="6496356" Type="4">C-587</Document> will not change anything. These offenders will still stay behind bars.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3756033">The legality of the bill is the other point I want to address. First, I would like to point out that the 25-year period was not determined arbitrarily. Paragraph 110 of the Rome statute of the International Criminal Court states that life in prison is the maximum sentence, but that it must be reviewed after 25 years.</ParaText><ParaText id="3756034">Therefore, international law does not allow for life sentences without eligibility for parole, even for the most serious crimes, such as war crimes, crimes against humanity and crimes of genocide. This is probably why Canada set the maximum parole ineligibility period at 25 years, even for the worst cases of first degree murder.</ParaText><ParaText id="3756035">Other states often look to Canada to learn from its principles of justice et its criminal justice. We are off to a bad start if we begin to renege on our international treaties to pass cosmetic bills.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3756036">What international law imposes, and what Canada decided to apply, is a maximum prison term of 25 years, which applies to all crimes. Our role is not really to say which crimes are most serious. Rather, it is to define the rule of law. Moreover, this bill undermines the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. </ParaText><ParaText id="3756037">The Supreme Court has yet to render a decision on the constitutionality of extending this maximum period in the case of consecutive parole ineligibility periods for multiple murders.</ParaText><ParaText id="3756038">Extending the ineligibility period from 25 to 40 years for murders involving abductions and sexual assault would probably be ruled unconstitutional by the courts. </ParaText><ParaText id="3756039">In the case of Bill <Document DbId="6251824" Type="4">C-478</Document>, the carbon copy of Bill <Document DbId="6496356" Type="4">C-587</Document>, we asked the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights to check compliance with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Conservatives voted against that and we were not able to do that study.</ParaText><ParaText id="3756040">If Bill <Document DbId="6496356" Type="4">C-587</Document> is challenged in court, taxpayers will again have to pay for even higher legal costs. The whole issue will end up before the Supreme Court, as it often happens already.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3756041">Since the Conservatives came to power, we have seen an increase in court action. There are challenges not only by the provinces, but also from the Supreme Court with respect to the compatibility and constitutionality of certain Conservative bills.</ParaText><ParaText id="3756042">It should be noted that Bill <Document DbId="6496356" Type="4">C-587</Document> continues the Conservative government's tradition of presenting measures to amend the Criminal Code through private members' bills introduced by backbench MPs.</ParaText><ParaText id="3756043">We remain concerned about the provisions in Bill <Document DbId="6496356" Type="4">C-587</Document> and their compatibility with the charter. Private members' bills are not submitted to the Department of Justice for review as to their compatibility with the charter and the Constitution.</ParaText><ParaText id="3756044">We are opposed to this bill. All though it seems well-meaning, it is unnecessary, ineffective and easy to attack in court. Once again, the Conservatives are just using smoke and mirrors and this could cause more challenges with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. </ParaText><ParaText id="3756045">I invite all my colleagues to vote against this bill.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Ravignat" id="8390769"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170290" Type="2">Mr. Mathieu Ravignat (Pontiac, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3756046">Mr. Speaker, this government is introducing yet another lousy bill. The government should have done a little more research and consulted experts in the matter to draft a better bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3756047">However, I do understand this government's intention. It must be said that the members across the way do have a genuine and deep desire to protect victims. All parties in the House can agree on that. There is certainly no disagreement between the government and the official opposition on that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3756048">However, for all their zeal, they still have to do things properly. The government must take into consideration current legislation and even other bills that it has introduced.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3756049">It would have made more sense to put some of the provisions of this bill into their bill on the Canadian victims bill of rights. Why did the Conservatives not do that? I do not know.</ParaText><ParaText id="3756050">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170299" Type="2">Gatineau</Affiliation>, who does an excellent job as our party's justice critic, already mentioned that point. I want to commend her for the excellent job she does. I am honoured to have a colleague like her.</ParaText><ParaText id="3756051">Bill <Document DbId="4668958" Type="3">C-48</Document>, which the member mentioned, was introduced during the previous Parliament. It amended the Criminal Code and the National Defence Act. Before the 2011 election, the bill had already been passed at third reading on division—not unanimously, as my colleague claimed. That is an important detail.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3756052">At the time, Steve Sullivan, who was the first ombudsman for victims of crime and who supports our position, said that the bill was nothing more than smoke and mirrors. If someone is charged with first degree murder, the crown is generally not concerned with less serious offences. When Mr. Olson was found guilty of murdering 11 children, the crown was not concerned with the charges of kidnapping or sexual assault, even though he clearly also committed those crimes. The crown would have had to prove each crime and could have used that to encourage a plea bargain, but it still depends on the judge's willingness to sentence someone to more than 25 years, which Mr. Sullivan thinks is unlikely.</ParaText><ParaText id="3756053">He does not think that many judges would sentence a criminal to life in prison with no chance of parole for 40 years. He does not think that judges would do this. As a caveat, I want to point out that nearly all modern democratic countries offer the possibility of parole.</ParaText><ParaText id="3756054">In the bill we are examining today, judges retain their discretion, so how is this a solution to the problem the member who introduced this bill is trying to solve?</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3756055">Mr. Sullivan also went on to say that, when offenders are sentenced to life in prison without parole for 25 years, it is understood that they will not be granted parole if they represent a danger or a risk.</ParaText><ParaText id="3756056">This affects a very small number of offenders, specifically those who abduct, sexually assault and murder someone. These sordid crimes are rather rare. Mr. Olsen and Mr. Bernardo are examples of offenders who fall into this category. This measure would be used, at the most, only a few times a year, but it would not change anything for the families of victims.</ParaText><ParaText id="3756057">We should listen to the opinion of the former federal ombudsman for victims of crime. It is clear that Mr. Sullivan thinks that this bill does not do enough and would be useless. That is unfortunate.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
