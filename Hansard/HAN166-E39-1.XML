What did those members opposite, when they were still calling themselves Reformers, say then? They called it heavy-handed and iron fisted.

In fact, they heard very specific promises, as my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78975" Type="2">Labrador</Affiliation>, just explained to the House, like this one from a Conservative Party mailout, which stated in 2004:</ParaText><ParaText id="688037"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The Conservative Party of Canada believes that offshore oil and gas revenues are the key to real economic growth in Atlantic Canada.

Call it what we want, it boils down to one thing, a broken promise to Atlantic Canadians. Yes, the budget allows various options for provinces, but these are only designed to cover up the reality. The budget put in place exactly what the Conservatives promised not to do, a cap, and Atlantic Canadians know it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688040">The people of Saskatchewan heard very similar explicit promises. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> even wrote a letter to Premier Calvert on June 10, 2004, stating unequivocally that 100% of natural resources would be excluded, no ifs, ands or buts, and no mention of a cap, another obvious broken promise.</ParaText><ParaText id="688041">The Conservatives' platform in the last election promised that they “would ensure that non-renewable natural resources revenue is removed from the equalization formula”. Those who voted for the Conservatives in Saskatchewan and Atlantic Canada put their trust in that commitment. That trust was broken.</ParaText><ParaText id="688042">As is typical of the government, it is now trying to deceive Canadians by throwing up smokescreens. Even yesterday the finance minister talked about the promise being fulfilled because the provinces have options. They can choose the old formula or they can choose the new formula with 50% exclusion, but what they cannot choose is what they were explicitly promised, 100% exclusion, the honouring of the Atlantic accords, with no caps.</ParaText><ParaText id="688043">Canadians know that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the government broke their word on equalization and the Atlantic accords.

In Canada if one is unable to say, “I am sorry”, there is another way to say it. It is, “Je suis désolé”.</ParaText><ParaText id="688046">The relationship between the federal government and its provincial partners is one built on trust, yet the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is eroding that trust, and the relationship is suffering as a result.

He might not want a deal, but the people of Newfoundland and Labrador want a good deal, and that is what they will get.</ParaText><ParaText id="688084">I will give the House a bit of history here. What is this all about? If the government had not recognized the fact that there was a fiscal imbalance in the country, then we would not be here today. This would not be an issue. We recognized that there was a fiscal imbalance. The past equalization program threw a few dollars at the provinces that made the loudest noise. As all of us know, that was not very successful.</ParaText><ParaText id="688085">The government started talking about addressing the fiscal imbalance. In order to do that, we needed a formula that everybody would accept and buy into and one in which everybody could participate.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688086">Leading up to the last election, our party said in our blue book that if we formed government, we would be satisfied to take 100% of the non-renewable resources out of the formula. We are not denying that. It is there in black and white in our blue book and on web pages and so on.</ParaText><ParaText id="688087">We did not dump that when we were elected. In the election and after the election we said that we, as government, were willing to take 100% of all non-renewable resources, and not just oil and gas, out of the equalization formula. </ParaText><ParaText id="688088">The equalization formula affects 10 provinces and three territories. They are affected by whatever formula Ottawa puts in place. Consequently, they will decide if this is the best formula for them collectively. Of course, each province will ask if this is the best formula for it. </ParaText><ParaText id="688089">The premiers met on several occasions and the finance ministers met. They could not agree on the formula. The majority of them did not want what we offered in relation to taking out 100% of all non-renewable resources. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688090"> People at home are saying that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> broke a promise. It was not the Prime Minister; it was the party and then the government. I am not denying that. We made a commitment. We were ready and willing to do that. We did not say to the provinces that we would not do that. The provinces had a whole year to put together a formula, including what we had committed, to address the fiscal imbalance of the country. The majority of the provinces said that it would make it worse for them rather than better. They said that they needed something else.</ParaText><ParaText id="688091">Back several months ago, the talk about equalization and fiscal imbalance centred around the O'Brien formula. The government of the day, Liberal members opposite, initiated an independent study by highly qualified people, chaired by Mr. O'Brien, who brought forth a formula to address equalization. That became the talk of the town. Everybody, including all the premiers, realized that was probably where they were headed and they started to scramble to get the best they could out of that formula. This is all on the record. I am not it making up.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688092">The Premier of Newfoundland made a request to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> that the Atlantic accord be protected. The two provinces, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador, had different agreements. They were not special agreements. They were not fancy side deals. They had agreements with the Government of Canada that they had worked hard for, which recognized the fact that their offshore oil and gas resources were located offshore, outside the land mass, and were supposedly controlled and owned by Canada.</ParaText>

Sitting in the background with myself and others was one of the members on the other side, who is clapping his hands for a great agreement for the Conservatives.</ParaText><ParaText id="688096">When we moved forward, in 2005 the Williams government, led by finance minister Sullivan, negotiated some improvements to the Atlantic accord.

I was watching the hockey game last night, as a lot of people were, and thinking about the referees. They work an hour a night, basically, and get paid a lot more than you. I think you would make a tremendous referee because a lot of them are not of physical stature to break up the rackets. With a pair of skates and a much bigger salary, you would do it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688099">If you, Mr. Speaker, were making $20,000 a year and somebody suddenly gave you a cheque for $200,000 and you came home waving it, everybody in the family would be delighted. However, what you did not tell them is that for the next 10 years all of your net income would go into the bank because you just got a $200,000 advance.</ParaText><ParaText id="688100">Newfoundland and Labrador received a $2 billion advance. That is all it got, nothing extra, nothing that did not belong to it, nothing above and beyond what it would get over time. Newfoundland and Labrador received it so it could pay down our the tremendous debt. The premier almost had a contest asking how people wanted it spent when he knew, because it is written in the agreement, it had to go toward the debt. It is all fun and games.</ParaText><ParaText id="688101">All of it has not been drawn down yet, but it will be over the next few years. There is still somewhere around $1 billion, or a bit less. Some people think that if anything happens such as caps the province will lose it and it will be clawed back. Absolutely not. Let me state it clearly and categorically that the advance money given to Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador, regardless of what happens, will not be clawed back.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="55">(1055)</Timestamp><ParaText id="688102">Any payments the province get because of the Atlantic accords will not be capped. The accord will not be capped. The accord is protected. Write it down. Look at <I>Hansard</I>. Cut it out. Show it to me in five years. We will not know those things right away simply because the province is still receiving equalization money.</ParaText><ParaText id="688103"> The unfortunate thing about it is it province is not receiving much. In our province, as we say at home, we are getting well off. We are starting to become a have province. I am proud of that. I think the members opposite are proud of that. However, as anybody knows, we cannot have our cake and eat it too. I do not think anybody is really asking for it, if they understood what this is all about. What we do not want is for something that we own, something that we were promised, something that we were given, to be taken away.</ParaText><ParaText id="688104">Let me assure the members it will not be taken away. How do I know that? Because I have been working on it. I have not been sitting, complaining. I have not been running around the country, yelling and screaming and complaining about Ottawa not doing anything, when I have not even asked it, when I have not met with it and when I have not negotiated. We do not get deals unless we negotiate.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688105">This year our province is receiving $477 million in equalization. Next year we will receive only $197 million. It is not, if our economy keeps going, the year after that we will get nothing.</ParaText><ParaText id="688106">Why our equalization is going down is because our revenues from resource development, in particular, including the offshore oil and gas, have been going up. We have not lost any of the money. Anything we have lost in relation to the total revenues we would receive has been given to us by what we call offset payments, through the Atlantic accord, and people think this will end. It will only end when the accord fizzles out.</ParaText><ParaText id="688107">When the accord agreement was signed in 1985 to give us this money in lieu of clawback, in lieu of equalization losses, it was due to expire in 2011. Nobody has this by the way. It is not a bad deal and others would love to have it. The $2 billion upfront payment, which we could bring home and wave around, was an advance payment. We are not getting a cent directly from government these days in relation to offset payments. It is all kept because the government gave it to us in advance. When the advance is paid off, we will start getting real money again.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688108">The other thing they did a couple of years ago, in 2005, is they negotiated one extra year on the length of the accord agreement. The accord now ends in 2012. What does that mean? That means that in 2012 that is it. Our province will not get any more of these offset payments, unless in one of the two previous years, 2010 or 2011, we are on equalization. If we are receiving equalization, the accord is extended until 2020. If it is, and I hope it is, we will continue to receive every benefit from that accord because we have committed, with no changes to the accord, no capping of the accord, despite what members say.</ParaText><ParaText id="688109">To finish, in relation to equalization, there is not a chance, according to economists, that we will be on equalization in either of these years to qualify for the accord payments, unless we go to the new formula. If we go to the new formula, because of the 10 provinces, we might then qualify. If our province does, the theory is we will be capped. The Atlantic accord will never be capped.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

He should have made sure that he would be able to live up to the commitments he was making to Canadians during the election campaign and on other occasions. Otherwise, he should not have made them or promised such things.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688142">The text of the motion addresses only that particular issue. The solution that the government came up with, however, although not ideal, is nevertheless a step in the right direction. In that regard, we must put things in perspective. The Liberal Party can say that the government has failed to live up to verbal and written commitments made to premiers, because that is a fact. But, we must also look at the solution. The Bloc will vote in favour of the motion as it stands.<Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1"></Affiliation></ParaText><ParaText id="688143">I would also like to talk about the underlying issue, about equalization. I would remind the House of a number of things. Equalization is fully funded by the federal government using tax money paid by Quebeckers and Canadians from across the country. This equalization program is the result of a fundamental commitment to ensure fairness. In a federation like Canada, equalization has a very specific goal, namely, to ensure that, from coast to coast to coast, Canadians have access to public services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688144">Several countries—most of them federations—have equalization programs. The method consists primarily of evaluating the fiscal capacity of the provinces to provide public services. Provinces with a lower capacity to fund comparable public services receive equalization payments, whereas the others receive none. Quebec receives a significant amount in equalization payments, a little more than 50%. However, on a per capita basis, it finds itself behind several other provinces. In this sense, it is not the spoiled child of the system.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688145">The federal government's equalization payments to the provinces are unconditional and have no strings attached. Equalization does not take into account the expenditure needs of provinces and its sole purpose is to increase the fiscal capacity of the provinces to a common standard. There is no reduction in terms of equalization for provinces with fiscal capacity greater than the common standard. </ParaText><ParaText id="688146">This is not the first time that this situation has arisen. In June 2004, the former Liberal prime minister made election promises during the federal campaign. The Premier of Newfoundland got the prime minister to promise to let the Government of Newfoundland keep all its oil revenues with no reduction in amounts disbursed to the province under the equalization program. </ParaText><ParaText id="688147">This position was unacceptable to Quebec. However, the Liberal prime minister did not keep this promise. At the first ministers conference of October 26, Ottawa insisted that there be a cap and that amounts exceeding the cap would result in a reduction of equalization payments. The Conservatives went into action on October 26, when the current <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made a series of very formal commitments.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688148"> Recently, I was at the Standing Committee on Finance when the Premier of Saskatchewan testified. He showed in a very clear, precise way that those commitments were made at that time. In that sense, the motion that we are debating today is justified. However, within the framework of our discussions on this subject, it seems to us that the equalization formula set out in Budget 2007 is a step forward but it falls well short of the unanimous demands of Quebec. It contains some positive aspects. It is a formula founded on principles. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp><ParaText id="688149"> The new formula uses the real value of property taxes. The payments are calculated on the basis of the ten province standard, which pretty well puts an end to the notion of ceilings and floors, but nevertheless it does not meet Quebec’s demands. </ParaText><ParaText id="688150"> What Quebec is demanding is, more or less, the following. It wants an adjustment of the equalization formula that will take into account the ten province standard, 100% of revenue from natural resources and the real value of property taxes. Why 100% of revenue from natural resources? Because, in the past, for example, Quebec developed its own hydroelectric resources without any significant support from the federal government while, in other sectors, other provinces received major financial assistance: Newfoundland, in particular, for the Hibernia project. </ParaText><ParaText id="688151"> Therefore, we want to see 100% of revenue from natural resources included in the formula, so that in the final tally Quebec has a total envelope of more than $16 billion for 2007-08. The only formula that will enable equalization to achieve its objective involves providing receiving provinces with a per capita fiscal capacity equal to the Canadian average. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688152"> Quebec’s demands flow from the Séguin report that was published in 2001 and unanimously adopted by the Quebec National Assembly. At that time, the Séguin report proposed four measures for adjusting the equalization formula to make it acceptable to Quebec. That involved the conditions that I mentioned earlier, namely, adopting the ten province standard, including 100% of revenue from natural resources, using real property values in calculating that part of the tax base related to property taxes instead of the theoretical value now in force, and abolishing ceilings and floors in the equalization envelope. </ParaText><ParaText id="688153"> The current government’s proposal to take account of 50% of revenue from development of natural resources seems to us a step in the right direction but it is not entirely what Quebec wants. It continues to advance its demand for the desired result, which is that 100% of revenue from development of natural resources be considered. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688154">All these proposals in Quebec were developed over the years. They resulted not only from the Séguin report, but also from three main documents on equalization reform. In 2004, the Quebec finance department—the Government of Quebec—revised the Séguin report when it tabled the 2004 budget. The document entitled “Correcting Fiscal Imbalance” updates the report of the commission chaired by Mr. Séguin. This document set out Quebec's unanimous demands and estimated the shortfall at $2.8 billion for Quebec for 2004-05 and at $5 billion for Canada as a whole.</ParaText><ParaText id="688155">Following that report came the Council of the Federation's report in 2005 and, finally, the report of the Expert Panel on Equalization.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688156">All these measures were aimed at recognizing that a fiscal imbalance existed, and it was the Bloc Québécois that raised the issue here in the House. Hon. members will recall that a few years ago, none of the political parties in this House were advocating recognition of a fiscal imbalance. The Bloc Québécois got to work and systematically obtained support from the parties here in the House, until this year's budget was tabled. The federal government has not corrected the fiscal imbalance per se, but it has come up with additional funding that finally corrects an unacceptable situation. The provinces had many needs, while the federal government had the money.</ParaText><ParaText id="688157">We backed our position on this issue with help from other people and the information and reports I mentioned earlier. But we brought the issue onto the federal political stage. In the end, we won a commitment from the Conservative government that it would pay attention to this issue and correct the fiscal imbalance.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688158">But we find ourselves facing the same situation that the motion criticizes, which is that the fiscal imbalance has not been completely corrected. Admittedly, there was a significant cash component to the budget. This is why the Bloc Québécois decided to support this budget, and as a representative for Quebeckers, it still feels it was the right choice.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp><ParaText id="688159">However, there is still a fiscal imbalance, and in the years to come we will remain dependent on economic vitality, revenues from the federal government, and the situation of the provinces. A permanent solution would be the transfer of tax points, tax transfers, which is currently not the case.</ParaText><ParaText id="688160">So the Bloc Québécois will continue to fight for a permanent solution to this current situation in which Quebec does not receive its per capita share compared to the other provinces. The debate on whether or not to take into account revenues from natural resources is an important one and will continue.</ParaText><ParaText id="688161">With the Liberal motion presented today, we can see that in a number of Canadian provinces, people who had received commitments, and who do not see those commitments in what was adopted, are frustrated. At the same time, it is clear that the discussion held to reach the solution set out in the budget is a step in the right direction. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688162">Unfortunately, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> should not have made these commitments if he was not certain he could live up to them. He has not lived up to them, or so the motion says and criticizes. The only thing to come out of all this so far was that the Bloc Québécois obtained significant amounts of money for Quebec through the federal budget. We hope to be able to continue in that vein. Nonetheless, our ultimate goal is truly to come to a solution that will no longer be subject to all the ups and downs that are often caused by election periods.</ParaText><ParaText id="688163">Earlier we looked at the background of the situation. In the past, the Liberal Party made commitments that it did not keep. The leader of the Conservative Party made commitments he still has not kept. Ultimately, the motion is on the credibility of politicians and the commitments they make.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688164">In certain instances, the public is able to understand that something has to give. However, for formal commitments on basic issues such as these, it would have been better if the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had not made such a commitment. He should have instead promised to work on finding a better solution. That is not the commitment he made to the provinces, which are particularly frustrated. There was also the commitment made to Quebec to do away with the fiscal imbalance. The solution is still not on the table. There is a monetary correction, but no final solutions. Quebeckers are still waiting for a solution to this issue. They will continue to take stock of the effectiveness of the hon. members and the parties in this House, namely on the issue of correcting the fiscal imbalance.</ParaText><ParaText id="688165">It is important to have a debate on this motion today because we are talking about the credibility of politicians. We have to be able to make the distinction between keeping a commitment and making proposals as a result of further analysis. In no way can we justify not keeping these formal commitments when there is no good explanation for it. The people in the provinces concerned get the impression they were hung out to dry because the Conservative Party did not keep its election promise.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688166">That is a serious warning for the future. This is a minority government that could go to the polls at the drop of a hat. Political parties will continue to make promises. The lesson to be gained from this is that if we wish to maintain our credibility as politicians and political parties, we must not make promises that we cannot keep. </ParaText><ParaText id="688167">Can we be sure that they knew this when they made the promise? That is something we should spend more time considering. All the same, the promise should not have been made. </ParaText><ParaText id="688168">Recently, we have been talking about the marked decline in voter participation in the electoral process.

To be accurate, let me quote it:</ParaText><ParaText id="688200"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Is there one Atlantic minister with the guts to tell his constituents that he will do everything in his power to fix the mistake?</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="688201">I could have said “this betrayal”, but I said mistake, because notwithstanding some of the comments we have heard this morning, this is both a mistake and a spectacular betrayal of a commitment made by the current <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of this country, who not so very long ago, in a slightly different role in between his political careers, talked about building a firewall around Alberta. The real purpose of that was to communicate to Canadians that just maybe Albertans would want to say, “Let us keep all of the benefits of our resources and let Atlantic Canadians freeze in the dark”. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688202">That kind of thinking went out in this country a very long time ago, so when the current <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> decided to make a political comeback he had to figure out how to jettison that view of the world, that view of our Canadian world, which was going to haunt him forever. I cannot help but think that part of the reason why he championed the Atlantic accord, in addition to just grubbing for votes in an election, was to try to change his image, to try to change his reputation as a politician in terms of how he viewed the Canada that we have been trying to build for a very long time in this country.</ParaText><ParaText id="688203">That brings me to the point that he now is the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada and he absolutely committed to the Atlantic accord. One has to wonder what it is that now has changed his mind so that he has decided to basically break this promise. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688204">What needs to be understood is what this broken promise is really all about, and I can tell members that it is understood in Atlantic Canada, but I believe it is also understood by people in the most prosperous and more populous parts of Canada. I am going to put it in Maritime terms. What it is really all about is that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his ministers, including the ministers who are supposed to be representing the interests of Atlantic Canada, have decided to turf overboard the Atlantic accord commitment they made because they have other fish to fry and bigger votes to catch, to go after and grub for, in the more prosperous and more populous parts of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="688205">I think the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> should understand that in those more populous and prosperous parts of Canada there are also a great many Canadians of all political stripes, who think that, first, prime ministers should keep their promises and, second, the kind of Canada they want to live in is one where we actually try to find ways to ensure that those who are living with fewer resources and trying to get themselves out of the have not status should be supported. They think that this is the way we want to make Canada work better.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688206">I think he should consider the possibility that there are a lot of Canadians who are going to take the view, whether they live outside of Atlantic Canada or not, that they do not approve of the broken promises and they do not approve of this attempt to block the very purpose of the Atlantic accord, which was to give the possibility and the potential, no guarantee but the possibility, that offshore resource revenues could actually help move Atlantic Canada out of a have not status. It is not just about Nova Scotia and Newfoundland either, because of course what impacts economically on our two provinces impacts on all of the Atlantic region economically.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="40">(1140)</Timestamp><ParaText id="688207">It is accurate to say that Atlantic Canadians feel absolutely betrayed and that there is a sense of the Conservative government breaking faith with Atlantic Canada. Let me just quickly revisit where this Atlantic accord started. Credit should be given where it is due, but there are also political lessons from it.</ParaText><ParaText id="688208"> Premier John Hamm, a Conservative premier, called together representatives of all political parties at the provincial level in Nova Scotia and then called together all political representatives at the federal level. I remember sitting in his office when he put to us the proposition that we work together across party lines and jurisdictional lines. We did that.</ParaText><ParaText id="688209">What the lesson showed was that when all parties work together for the common good, they can achieve things that some might have thought were ridiculous. I remember that the Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="78801" Type="2">Halifax West</Affiliation> dumped all over John Hamm's initiative even though he sat around that table and pledged that he would commit to it. He basically said that in the end we just were never going to get agreement on it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688210">Let it not be said that it cannot be done. Do not let them say that it cannot be done, because it was done, by respecting the fact that as elected representatives, whether we are federal or provincial, whatever party we represent, we share a responsibility to all of our citizens. That is why, in the few moments I have left, I want to make a plea that this debate not be about beating up on one another. This debate needs to be about fixing a problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="688211">This debate has to send a message, frankly, in part to the premier of Nova Scotia, to tell him to take a lesson out of his own predecessor's book and work across party lines and across jurisdictions to fix this problem. I think it is regrettable that on the three occasions I made representations, through my staff, to the premier's office to say that we would like to have a briefing on exactly where we are with the impact of this broken promise reflected in the budget, on those three occasions we followed up and no such briefing was ever given. There is no way on earth that John Hamm as premier would have failed to bring together the parties that still need to work together to fix this problem.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688212">The second point is an obvious one: this is a minority government. That is the party, no longer the Progressive Conservative Party but the Conservative Party, that said the wishes of this Parliament should be respected, especially in a minority government. Let us be clear that part of how we got the Atlantic accord in the first place was through cooperation and collaboration. Second, in a minority Parliament, it should be easier to fix it. However, we think the government should step forward, take its responsibility seriously and actually take some leadership to say that this is going to be fixed.</ParaText><ParaText id="688213">I heard some members suggest that there is no real loss, that there is no real problem here, and that we are misrepresenting the potential loss to Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador from this broken promise, so let me just quickly give an analogy. It is a bit like Mr. Smith being called in by his boss one day, being commended for the tremendously valuable work he was doing and being told that he is getting a bonus. He is very pleased. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688214">The next year the company is doing very well, partly because Mr. Smith has made such a contribution to improving the lot of that company, and he is told that the good news is that everybody else is going to get a bonus this year because of his good work, but that he may not be as happy because he is not going to get the bonus. Mr. Smith says, “Wait a minute, where is the fairness in that?” He is told that he got a big bonus last year. </ParaText><ParaText id="688215">After arguing it out, the boss finally says to Mr. Smith that he actually can make a choice. Either he can give back his bonus from last year and get the same bonus that everyone else is getting, or he can keep last year's bonus and go without this year's.</ParaText><ParaText id="688216">This is an analogy that helps to give an understanding of what this choice is that the Conservative government keeps talking about and that Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador should be happy about. It is analogous to the unfairness of what I have just described between a boss and an employee.</ParaText>

							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp><ParaText id="688407">MacKinnon wants federal-provincial fiscal relations to be put on a more predictable, stable footing and be based on rules and established formulas that prevent the federal government from making ad hoc decisions and, in her words, “the 2007 federal budget goes a long way to achieving this goal”.</ParaText><ParaText id="688408">Let us listen to what Al O'Brien, the head of the expert federal panel, had to say. He said, “Budget 2007 adopted our recommendation. Our recommendation is the core framework and I'm really quite encouraged”.</ParaText><ParaText id="688409">Tackling this issue was not easy. It was not a simple proposition. It involved making tough decisions and seeking compromise. Fundamental to the working of any successful federation is compromise or, as MacKinnon put it, “Federal-provincial relations require compromise and a willingness of provinces to look beyond their own provincial borders”.</ParaText><ParaText id="688410">Through our efforts, equalization has been restored to a principles based program after years of ignoring it. Instead of working for partisan interests, we made our decisions in the best interests of all Canadians, including those in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador. That is what all premiers asked and all Canadians expect us to do. We will not apologize for that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688411">When we look at what we have done and the commitments we have made to each province and territory in this country, it is clear that decisions are not easy and tough decisions are that much more difficult to make. When we look at Newfoundland and Labrador or Nova Scotia, they receive $1.3 billion under the new equalization formula: $130 million in offshore accord offsets, $639 million under the Canada health care transfer and $277 million for the Canada social transfer, which includes additional funding for post-secondary education and child care. Commitments made throughout the country in each province and territory are included in the budget.</ParaText><ParaText id="688412">The budget went through committee and the committee heard from witnesses, including the Saskatchewan premier who was given an hour to ensure he had a full opportunity to present his thoughts and his position on the budget and what he felt it did not include. We did not ignore anyone who wanted the opportunity to speak to this.</ParaText><ParaText id="688413">However, what is important at the end of the day is that we have a budget, which the finance committee went through clause by clause. We are debating it in the House today. It should go through the Senate process of being heard but, as I indicated in my speaking notes, there are close to $5 billion worth of priorities waiting.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688414">The fact that we have put a number to it is important and relevant from a numbers perspective but what needs to be heard is that there are many programs that hinge on that funding to be implemented in this year. </ParaText><ParaText id="688415">We obviously look to the leaders in the Senate, the majority of whom are from the Liberal Party, to dedicate themselves, prior to the end of this month, to ensuring the budget passes and becomes law so the expenditures within it can be met, whether they be from one end of the country to the other, for defence, the environment or the investment in the work Rick Hansen has done for decades in this country, which has now been recognized.</ParaText><ParaText id="688416">From the over 450 presentations at the finance committee, 44 recommendations were put together by all parties and they were given to the finance minister.

There are institutions that Canadians have to be able to depend on. One is the office of the Prime Minister. While we may debate policy, while we may have different opinions on how to bring the country forward and what the right programs are for our country, we should always be able to depend on the office of the Prime Minister, and that whoever occupies that office at the time will be a person of integrity who is true to his or her word.</ParaText><ParaText id="688501">It is very disappointing that we are in the situation where Canadians cannot trust the office of the Prime Minister because the person who holds the office has shown time and again that his word is completely meaningless. Let us remember back to before the same individual became <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. He said that supply management was a communist scheme of price fixing. He said that we had to build firewalls around Alberta. On national unity he said he did not care how many national capitals there were, and he now calls himself the great defender of national unity. That is the person in whom we should be able to put our trust and confidence in trying to advance the interests of the citizens of this country and the country's future.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688502">When we look at the example of the Atlantic accord, I think first we should look at what the accord is. The accord is quite simple. It says that Nova Scotia and Newfoundland shall benefit from 100% of the revenues from their non-renewable resources, in this case offshore oil and gas, to the exclusion of all other programs. That means if there is change in equalization, if there is additional money given in other programs by the federal government to the provinces, that Nova Scotia and Newfoundland would their share and the Atlantic accord is separate from that. It is above and beyond all other programs.</ParaText><ParaText id="688503">The budget turns it into an either/or situation. The province of Nova Scotia and its finance minister must decide whether to participate in the new equalization formula which has some advantages for Nova Scotia, or to maintain the Atlantic accord which also has some advantages for Nova Scotia. If Nova Scotia goes into the new equalization formula, the Atlantic accord substantially disappears, the amount of revenue is capped and Nova Scotia stands to lose $1 billion.</ParaText>

Well, perhaps one could make that argument. Perhaps the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> could advance that argument but that is not the argument he advanced during the election campaign. He said in writing and verbally that he would honour the letter and the intent of the accord.</ParaText><ParaText id="688505">I remember when I was on the government side of the House, we presented a budget that included the ways and means to implement the Atlantic accord. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and members of his party, the opposition at that time, asked that we split the bill, that we remove the Atlantic accord from the budget because the intention of the opposition members at that time was to vote against the budget but they wanted to vote in favour of the accord.</ParaText><ParaText id="688506">That was the very same accord they are now knee-capping.

As we have said in the past, we did not agree with the Atlantic accords in principle, and we still do not agree with them. However, it is perfectly obvious that the government has broken its promise, and we will not argue with that whether we like it or not.

This government calls itself the “new government” and promised to do things differently from the previous Liberal government. Unfortunately, it seems that the government has learned quickly and has wasted no time following in its Liberal predecessors' footsteps. This government has broken a lot of promises.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688540">The Atlantic accords we are talking about today are a prime example, even though—and I will come back to this later in my speech—we do not agree with these accords and we do not think the government should move forward with them.</ParaText><ParaText id="688541">According to this motion—or at least according to the Bloc's interpretation of it—the government is being criticized for, deliberately or not, making irresponsible election promises. I would hope it did so out of incompetence and not with the deliberate intention of misleading and fooling the electors. The fact remains that a promise was made and it is not being kept. The Bloc Québécois denounces this irresponsible promise.</ParaText><ParaText id="688542">Among the many other areas where the government has not kept its promises is the matter of the seat at UNESCO. Once again, the government is playing with words and repeating the same thing ad nauseam—that it made good on its promises— in the hope that by constantly repeating the same thing, whether it is true or not, the public will believe it one day. That is what happened with the seat at UNESCO.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688543">During the election campaign the Prime Minister promised to give Quebec a seat at UNESCO, like the seat Quebec has in the Francophonie. That is what he said, verbatim, what he repeated, what he wrote down and has never denied. Obviously, when we talk about a seat in the Francophonie, we are talking about a full seat, a voice and a vote. That is what all Quebeckers were expecting. That is what everyone was talking about. The Prime Minister never said to Quebeckers during the election campaign that what he was really promising was a small folding seat, a little stool at the back where they could whisper their agreement, or stay quiet should they disagree. That was never the case.</ParaText><ParaText id="688544">When the Conservative government proposed this accord, it was saying to Quebeckers that it agreed to bring its delegation along, that it would be allowed to participate and give its opinion provided that this opinion fell within the general position of the federal government, or something to that effect.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp><ParaText id="688545">In other words, Quebec would have the right to indicate its agreement, but if it does not agree, it would not be allowed to say so. More importantly, unlike what was promised, Quebeckers would have no right to vote, as it does at the OIF. That is another promise that was completely broken. It is so true that nothing has been done. When the government made that proposal, even my predecessor in Jeanne-Le Ber, who was once the Minister of Canadian Heritage, said that, in any case, that was already how it was done. No one ever stopped Quebec representatives from coming along, sitting in the background and whispering comments. We are really no further ahead. This has been nothing but smoke and mirrors, with basically nothing new to indicate that this promise, giving Quebec the right to vote, will be honoured.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688546">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> resorted to false arguments concerning the issue of Quebec's right to vote, saying that, at UNESCO, only independent states have the right to vote. First of all, with all due respect, I would point out that, when the Prime Minister and the Conservatives made this promise to Quebeckers, they knew that. Second, they could have allowed for a mechanism by which, when the two positions are at odds, Quebec would abstain, which would mean the same result. That is another broken promise. For people in the maritime provinces, there was a broken promise regarding the Atlantic Accords, and for Quebec, it was our seat at UNESCO. Income trusts have been discussed at length in this House. The structure of these income trusts allowed certain legal entities to get out of paying taxes, and we saw more and more businesses convert to income trusts under pressure from their shareholders to pay less tax.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688547">The Bloc Québécois had asked for a moratorium on the conversion to income trusts. It has always said that the conversion of businesses to income trusts for tax purposes was not a good thing. This was its position before, during and after the election campaign. Naturally, when the government decided to tax income trusts to partly close this loophole in Canadian taxation, we thought it was a good idea and we supported it. Nevertheless, that was another promise that the Conservatives did not keep. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had personally promised, in black and white, during the election campaign to never—and not just maybe—never tax income trusts. Consequently, some Quebeckers and Canadians, taken in by the Prime Minister, invested in income trusts believing that they would realize large returns. The value of income trusts continued to climb on the premise of the Prime Minister's good faith. The mistake made by these investors was that they probably believed the Conservatives would keep their promise. They did not. The day the government announced that it would put an end to the special tax treatment for income trusts, they dropped sharply in value, placing many investors in very unfortunate circumstances because they suffered huge losses. And all this because the government, to get elected, made unacceptable and irresponsible promises resulting in this situation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688548">And that is not all. Many other promises were broken by this government. I would like to speak in more detail about the promise regarding the fiscal imbalance. This has been a long fight for the Bloc Québécois</ParaText><ParaText id="688549">Here again, the government seems to think that it only has to continue repeating the same thing and the public will end up believing it.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp><ParaText id="688550">I was amazed to see how the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> “corrected the fiscal imbalance” in his latest budget. He just tabled a budget, increased cash transfers to Quebec and the provinces and then got up in the House and said that the fiscal imbalance had been fixed. To him, just saying that, despite all the evidence to the contrary, was enough to convince people. When the Conservatives promised Quebeckers to correct the fiscal imbalance, Quebeckers expected that the solution would be along the lines of the consensus that had formed in Quebec, which had been built around the Séguin commission on the fiscal imbalance. When the concept of fiscal imbalance was put forward, the phrase “fiscal imbalance” was not chosen at random, out of a hat, it was chosen deliberately, because there was an imbalance between the federal government and the provinces and this imbalance was fiscal in nature. Otherwise, it would have been called the budgetary imbalance or the monetary imbalance. But it was called the fiscal imbalance. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688551">When the Conservatives promised Quebeckers to correct the fiscal imbalance, Quebeckers had reason to expect a fiscal solution. Yet this budget contains no tax measures. I asked the finance committee, officials and the minister himself. The minister admitted quite candidly that his budget contained no tax transfers to Quebec or the provinces. At the same time as he is saying that the budget contains no tax transfers, no tax measures to correct the fiscal imbalance, he is telling us that it has been fixed. Something is wrong there.</ParaText><ParaText id="688552">We voted for the budget because it represented a step forward and transferred significant amounts to Quebec and the provinces. But there is no guarantee that those amounts will still be there in one year, two years or three years. Quebec and the other provinces that receive equalization transfers, for example, are still subject to the whims of the federal government. The equalization formula has just been amended, but it could be amended again in the next budget, whether that budget is brought down by this or another government.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688553">Quebec wanted financial autonomy, it wanted to receive stable, predictable revenues which would grow over time, and over which it would have control, so that it would not be at the mercy of the federal government's choices. It is so true that the fiscal imbalance is not permanently corrected and that Quebec still depends on the federal government, that even the Conservatives' Quebec advertising says—and I want to get this right—that the Leader of the Opposition, if he became prime minister, could take back the money. This is what the Conservatives are saying. Their advertisements in Quebec say that the fiscal imbalance that they claim has been permanently corrected, could return if another government were elected. This is not a correction. It would have been corrected if tax fields had been transferred, GST for example, to the Government of Quebec. It could have had complete and total control over the revenues, which would be predictable over time, and all this with no chance of the federal government backtracking. It could have been the transfer of tax points, as was done in the past, but this was not the case.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688554">A number of promises have been broken by this government, and the government before it. We can objectively say that it is fortunate this is a minority government, because it is breaking just as many promises despite the fact that it is a minority. I cannot imagine what would happen if it was a majority government and could do what it wanted in the House.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp><ParaText id="688555">We can imagine that the number and importance of the broken promises would increase significantly.</ParaText><ParaText id="688556">Today's Liberal motion has the advantage of being a reminder to Quebeckers. They must send as many Bloc Québécois members as possible to Ottawa to ensure that their voice is strong. No matter which party is in power, we are crossing our fingers that it is a minority so that it cannot do whatever it wants.</ParaText><ParaText id="688557">I have made a list of some election promises broken by the government. I would now like to get down to specifics and talk about the Atlantic accords, which the Bloc Québécois does not agree with. On the one hand, these accords violate the equalization principle, which should ensure that all provinces can offer similar services to all their citizens, with a similar tax rate, regardless of how rich the province is. On the other hand, Quebec has already contributed financially to the development of the fossil fuels industry. Now that this development has taken place, we absolutely do not agree with continuing to contribute to it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688558">For example, from 1970 to 1999, Ottawa gave $66 billion in direct subsidies to the fossil fuels industry, including coal, natural gas and oil—an industry that for all intents and purposes does not exist in Quebec. During the same period, a paltry $329 million was given to the renewable energy sector. Of that money, not a penny went to hydroelectricity. While Quebec was investing in hydroelectricity, Ottawa was supporting the development of polluting energy sources instead. </ParaText><ParaText id="688559">The oil and gas industry was developed in large part with the taxes paid by Quebeckers, even though this development went against the fundamental interests of Quebec, economically or environmentally speaking, since polluting energy sources, as their name suggests, create more pollution. Some $66 billion has already gone toward this development. In the case of Hibernia, we can talk about $5 billion, roughly a quarter of which came from Quebeckers' taxes. Now that we have paid for this development, now that the companies have become profitable and the development of these non-renewable resources has become lucrative for the provinces, Quebeckers are being asked to keep paying for this development? It seems completely illogical to me to give a bonus to provinces for developing non-renewable energies, but not for renewable energies.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688560">This exclusion of non-renewable resources is completely arbitrary. Why was this choice made when there are hardly any such resources in Quebec and other tax fields could have been excluded? Excluding the aerospace industry, for example, would have benefited Quebec greatly. Excluding renewable energies such as hydroelectricity would also have represented billions of dollars in equalization, but no. Non-renewable resources were chosen and are excluded from the equalization calculation. This seems completely arbitrary and unjustified.</ParaText><ParaText id="688561">I want to close by dispelling a myth I have heard far too often in this House, that Quebeckers were the main beneficiaries of equalization. It is true that the amount is greater. That said, the population of Quebec is larger and, per capita, Quebeckers receive the least amount of equalization. Just take the amount and divide it by the number of people in Quebec.</ParaText>

I know that the whips have discussed looking at clearing this up. Perhaps I could explain it to other members because I think there is a lot of concern not only by the independent members but by others about what it is that the whips and the procedure and House affairs committee are concerned about here.</ParaText><ParaText id="688861">As I understand the issue, it is this: When there are a number of independent members there are obviously a certain number of questions and Standing Order 31 statements by members that could be assigned to those independent members. </ParaText><ParaText id="688862">We have had cases in the past, and indeed we could have cases in the future, where a party falls below the requisite 12 members. For that purpose there has been a precedent set for Speakers to pool the questions that those independent members would be entitled to so that they could assign their questions to their leader or to some other member of their caucus. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688863">In my political lifetime, members will recall that post-1993, we had that situation with two parties in the House of Commons. While the Progressive Conservative Party and the New Democratic Party were recognized registered political parties outside of this chamber, they did not have the requisite 12 members to be a recognized party in the chamber at the time. One had two members and the other had nine, as I recall. The Speaker at the time pooled, or bundled, or whatever term one wants to use, the number of questions that they would get during question period and then assigned the questions to them as a group.</ParaText><ParaText id="688864">I think this is where the problem lies, Mr. Speaker. Let us take into consideration that there are currently four independent members of Parliament. Of the questions that we usually go through in the rotation, the number of questions in a day, if we divide those, excluding the three that the government gets, by the number of opposition members of Parliament, whether they are one of the three recognized parties or the four independent members, we get to a ratio of how often each member would be eligible for a question, all things being equal.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688865">The problem arises if, for example, there were three independent members, each one of them should get one question per week. That makes sense. To make it equal, whether they were in a recognized party or sitting as an independent, they would have exactly the same rights to ask one question per week.</ParaText><ParaText id="688866">What has been happening as I understand it, Mr. Speaker, is that if you bundle those questions together and there are three questions for independents in a week and then two of the independents choose not to ask a question and you give the other questions to that other member as though they were a party, then that individual independent member would obviously get more questions than they would be entitled to if they sat in a recognized party.</ParaText><ParaText id="688867">I think that is the question that we are trying to deal with. Certainly, and I can speak for myself here, I do not want to see any inequity. I want to see the same rights and responsibilities for every member of Parliament, whether the member is an independent or whether the member sits in a recognized party, with no greater or lesser advantage to being in a party or sitting as an independent when it comes to those rights of a Standing Order 31 statement or asking a question in our chamber.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688868"> I think the goal is to ensure that if we take that equation, the number of questions asked per day or the number of questions asked per week and divide it by all the opposition members and we get to how many questions that person would get in a week, then it should be the same whether the person is an independent member or in a party.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="15">(1515)</Timestamp><ParaText id="688869">Obviously when a member is in a party, there is a mechanism in place to assign that question. Let us say for argument's sake, every member would get one question per week, whether the member was an independent or was in the Liberal Party, for example. </ParaText><ParaText id="688870">Obviously the Liberal Party has a mechanism in place in its caucus to assign those questions to certain members, whether it is the leader, the deputy leader or whoever it is. However, it should not detract from the basic rule that each member is equal in the eyes of this chamber. That is what we are trying to get to, I believe. I would look for others to support that fundamental principle of equality.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Each province's revenues and fiscal capacity are examined and compared to the Canadian average. Provinces whose fiscal capacity is below the Canadian average receive funds from the federal government to bring them up to the average. That is the principle.</ParaText><ParaText id="688896">The problem lies in how fiscal capacity is calculated. Under the Atlantic accords, the fiscal capacity of the Atlantic provinces is underestimated to make them appear poorer than they are, when the calculation is done, so that they receive more money than they would normally get if the principle were honoured.</ParaText><ParaText id="688897">The Bloc Québécois believes that this has nothing to do with ensuring that the Canadian federation works well. Rather, it is a purely arbitrary choice. The government decided to exclude non-renewable natural resources simply because that favoured a few provinces. It could have excluded other sectors of the economy that would have benefited Quebec.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688898">I am sure that if the government had decided to exclude hydroelectricity and aerospace, for example, from the equalization calculation, many people would have stood up and asked why the government was deviating from the principle just to please Quebec. And they likely would have been right.</ParaText><ParaText id="688899">We believe that the same rule should apply to everyone. If we are going to compare the provinces' fiscal capacities, we have to do so without playing with the figures, without excluding one sector or another of the economy to benefit one province or another.</ParaText><ParaText id="688900">Overall, equalization has nothing to do with the fiscal imbalance because equalization is a budget transfer. With the latest equalization formula and other transfers, the Government of Quebec receives more money than before. This does not correct the fiscal imbalance, because it is not a real transfer of tax room, such as the GST or tax points. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688901"> In the next budget, the federal government can take back what it gave to Quebec, as it just took back what it had given to the Atlantic provinces. This shows that the problem of the fiscal imbalance has not been resolved at all. Even though we do not basically agree with the Atlantic accords, they are eloquent proof that, in a system based on equalization, the provinces are all at the mercy of the federal government’s benevolence at any given time for their finances. That is what we do not like and have been fighting for a very long time. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

For 13 years, the Liberal government did not even recognize the existence of a fiscal imbalance, and the Liberal Party still does not recognize it. They refuse to admit that there is a fiscal imbalance. People say that Quebec and the provinces have been hard hit by this, but it is really the people of Quebec and the provinces who have suffered. We cannot say that it is just the provinces and so we do not really care. People have gone without services because of the imbalance between the constitutional obligations of the federal and provincial governments and their respective revenues.</ParaText><ParaText id="688905"> Even though the Conservative Party, for its part, recognizes that there is an imbalance in the federation, it does not really see that the imbalance is fiscal in nature. The fix it provided in the last budget took the form of cash transfers. This means that, every year and for every budget, Quebec is ultimately at the mercy of the ideological and political choices that the federal government may make in light of the political situation at the time, regardless of whether the Conservatives, the Liberals, or some other party is in power. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688906"> That is the nub of the problem. That is why Quebeckers of all political stripes in the National Assembly, regardless of whether they are Liberals, ADQ or Parti Québécois, are demanding a genuine fiscal solution. That was the thrust of the Séguin commission which asked, for example, that the GST be transferred to the provinces. Equalization would have to be re-worked, of course, if the direct transfers to the provinces were cut by this much. If there is a tax transfer to the provinces, however, they will have stable, predictable revenues over which they have full control and which are not subject to every whim of the federal government. </ParaText><ParaText id="688907"> This is really the nub of the issue.

However, the part of the debate that I am focused on is not whether equalization is right or wrong or what is best for this province or that province. My focus is on the fact that I think the Government of Canada should honour a signed contract.</ParaText><ParaText id="688947">I believe that when the Government of Canada signs a contract this should be gold-plated. It should be bulletproof. When the Government of Canada signs its name, with the little red flag, on a piece of paper, whether it is a person in Tokyo, in Moscow, in Halifax or in St. John's, Newfoundland, the person should be able to count on that signature as being solid gold.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688948">The contract we are talking about today, the one that has been amended so much in the budget, Bill <Document DbId="2801101" Type="3">C-52</Document>, was only signed in 2005. It is a 14-year contract signed by the Government of Canada and the Province of Nova Scotia. We are only two years into the contract and the government has decided it does not like it. Consequently, the government has put 12 amendments in the budget. I want the members opposite to notice, because what they say is not accurate, but under consequential amendments there are 12 paragraphs of amendments to the Atlantic accord.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688949">If we go further, there are six paragraphs of amendments to the offshore revenue agreement that John Hamm signed two years ago in 2005. The government is now taking the contract signed by the Government of Nova Scotia and the Government of Canada and amending it with six fundamental changes to the contract. This is simply right or wrong and I think every Canadian has an interest in this. This is not just in the interest of Nova Scotia or Newfoundland. Every member of Parliament in this House should insist that if the Government of Canada signs a document, no matter if it is a Liberal government, a Conservative government, an NDP government or, heaven forbid, a Bloc government, the Government of Canada should honour the contract, no matter what, for the life of the contract. It is not flexible and it is not amendable. I honestly think the member for <Affiliation DbId="78709" Type="2">Edmonton—Leduc</Affiliation> would agree with that.</ParaText><ParaText id="688950">I was just given a news article containing a comment by the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> at the G-8 a few minutes ago.

							<ParaText id="688951">I do want to say that it is a good budget and it is good for my riding. Many things in the budget do support and help my rural riding. However, that does not give the government permission to break a contract. Just because the government does some good things, it does not give it permission to break a contract.

							<ParaText id="688955">A week ago yesterday I realized that we were not making any headway. I wrote to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and put it right in his hand and said, “We're not making any headway with this by working behind the scenes. I am going to start speaking out publicly”. He took exception to that. I said, “We have to put pressure on it to make it move ahead”. I gave it to him in writing. I did not want to broadside him. I waited two days and then I made my first statement. Again, we made no progress.</ParaText><ParaText id="688956">On Monday morning, I wrote the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> a letter and said, “I cannot support this bill because it breaks a contract between the Government of Canada and the Government of Nova Scotia and I will not vote for it”. I made it very clear. I said it in two places in the letter.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="50">(1550)</Timestamp><ParaText id="688957">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> knows exactly why I voted for the budget the first time. We were in negotiations trying to find a solution but they went absolutely nowhere.</ParaText><ParaText id="688958">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> says that Nova Scotia will get $95 million more in equalization, but that is not true. If the Atlantic accord were honoured, it would get the $95 million, plus the benefits of the offset that are not included in this. That is the fundamental part of the problem. </ParaText><ParaText id="688959">We believe the Atlantic accord could be changed with four or five words. The problem is that the budget and the accord have different wording. I have pointed this out to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> several times. The accord says that the calculation of the payment will be based on the equalization formula that exists at the time. Any time the Government of Nova Scotia wants to calculate its offset payment, it would use the equalization formula that exists at the time. </ParaText><ParaText id="688960">Now, if we change it in 2010, it is that formula. If we change it in 2015, it is that formula. If we change it in 2019, it is that formula. That is what the accord says, which is a signed agreement and agreed to by both sides.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688961">However, if we go to page 115 in the budget, it says that from now on it will be based on the previous formula. Instead of the vision of the accord, which is to follow along as the equalization formula evolves and changes, the budget locks it in at the previous formula. It, therefore, amends and changes the Atlantic accord fundamentally. </ParaText><ParaText id="688962">I asked the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> today if he would stop saying that Nova Scotia has the option of the new formula or the old Atlantic accord, because it does not. He said it a thousand times. Many of the ministers have. I said it myself, because I believed it, until I got into this. However, it is not true. The Province of Nova Scotia and the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador do not have the option of the new formula or the old Atlantic accord. Everybody in this House has heard the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> say that a dozen times. It is not true because the budget changes both Atlantic accord agreements. Twelve paragraphs in the accord are changed and amended and six paragraphs on the John Hamm agreement that was negotiated in 2005. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688963">If the government wants to be honest and accurate, it should say that the Province of Nova Scotia has the choice of the new formula or an amended Atlantic accord, but that it does not have access to the old Atlantic accord.</ParaText><ParaText id="688964">I had hoped the minister would take my advice and be accurate and say that if that is the case. When I asked that question, he pointed out that I said that the budget was good. I did say the budget was good and that it was good for my riding but it does not give anybody the right to break a contract. We all sign contracts and we all honour them. All Canadians honour contracts. The Government of Canada should honour its contracts, no matter who signs them, whether it is the Liberals, the Conservatives, the NDP or whichever party is the government at the time. I feel very strongly about that.</ParaText><ParaText id="688965">I will go back to this nine paragraph agreement called the Atlantic accord. It was signed and agreed to by John Hamm and the very distinguished minister of fisheries and oceans at the time, the member from Halifax. It is a simple agreement but a very meaningful one to Nova Scotia. </ParaText><ParaText id="688966">Newfoundland and Labrador has a similar agreement and it means the world to Newfoundland and Labrador, as it does to Nova Scotia. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688967">The member for <Affiliation DbId="78709" Type="2">Edmonton—Leduc</Affiliation> took exception to the agreement but every province has exceptions and every province has special deals. This is our special deal and we value it tremendously. </ParaText><ParaText id="688968">We just signed an agreement with British Columbia to give it hundreds of millions of dollars for the Pacific Gateway. Manitoba did not get a Pacific Gateway fund, neither did Ontario nor did Digby.</ParaText><ParaText id="688969"> Nova Scotia's special deal is the Atlantic accord and we are not flexible on it. We will continue to demand the Atlantic accord. It is only nine paragraphs long but it is a work of art. I did not realize how good it was until we got into this debate and I started to study it. It is really neat. I was moved to call John Hamm, the former premier of the province, because it is magic. I sold cars for 20 years and made a lot of deals but I could not make a deal as good as this one. It is an excellent deal and John Hamm deserves the credit.</ParaText>

I just wish the other Conservative members from Nova Scotia would show the same kind of intestinal fortitude.</ParaText><ParaText id="688973">I know the member has been carrying around for weeks a copy of the offshore accord and he referred to it at some length in his recent comments. I know he is aware that it talks about the fact that it is to apply to the equalization formula as it exists at the time. It seems to me, as I have heard comments from Conservative members today, that there has been a failure to comprehend that, a failure to comprehend what the accord is actually all about and what it means. The fact that no matter how equalization might change in the future, the accord and its provisions and the payments under it were to apply so that there would not be a clawback of offshore resource royalties from Nova Scotia or Newfoundland and Labrador.</ParaText>

I have listened carefully to remarks today, many of which were aimed at me. That is the slings and arrows of this place, Mr. Speaker, as you know full well having served here for so many years.</ParaText><ParaText id="688987">I did find myself curiously agreeing with some of the comments by my colleague from Halifax, though. She quite rightly pointed out, when she asked a question a moment ago, that the member for <Affiliation DbId="78801" Type="2">Halifax West</Affiliation> could be described as somewhat of a recent convert of the Atlantic accord. During the time he filled the post as minister for Nova Scotia, the post I currently hold, he was pushing the province of Nova Scotia to accept a deal that was not in the best interest of my province.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688988">I remember at the time the member from Halifax said, “If Nova Scotians were as wealthy as Ontarians in eight years time I don't believe they would be expected to keep getting equalization”. He said this on October 26. This was in advance of the Atlantic accord being signed. He also urged the minister of energy at the time, Cecil Clarke, to accept the deal, that it was an excellent deal for Nova Scotia. Yet the numbers now clearly show that at the time the offer that was put forward by the member from Halifax was for $640 million. We know the final deal that was arrived at with Nova Scotia was for $830 million. Therefore, he was bargaining hard for his province, my province, to take hundreds of millions of dollars less than it actually achieved. </ParaText><ParaText id="688989">This is what he had to say at the time, “I can't imagine for the life of me why Nova Scotia would not accept a deal this rich”. In October 2004 he told the Halifax <I>ChronicleHerald</I>, “They're turning up their noses at an excellent offer. I really can't understand why they're not agreeing to it and why they're so hung up on this question of eight years”.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688990">The member can be here today and sanctimoniously hold himself out as a champion of this cause, but at the end of the day he really had to be brought on side by the pushing and prodding of the premier of the day, John Hamm, as has been mentioned, who truly was the champion of the Atlantic accord, along with Cecil Clarke, the energy minister.</ParaText><ParaText id="688991">He and the member for <Affiliation DbId="78571" Type="2">LaSalle—Émard</Affiliation>, the Liberal leader and prime minister at that time, and the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> all voted against the motion in the House recognizing the Atlantic accord, all recognizing at that time that Nova Scotia should be the primary beneficiary of offshore oil and gas revenues. That is what they did. On November 15, 2004, I was here as were you, Mr. Speaker. There was a motion before the House that you and I both supported. They voted against it. Every member in the Liberal Party who has spoken today, with the exception perhaps of the not so newly elected member, who was not here in 2004, voted against the Atlantic accord.</ParaText><ParaText id="688992">Therefore, I will not take any lessons or any sanctimonious, disingenuous, holding themselves out as champions.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="688993">This is really about, when we strip away the rhetorical flourish, when we take away some of the contrasting views of a contract and when we strip away the discussion of what this comes down to, it is about equalization for the country, an offshore oil and gas revenue deal that was put in place to insist that Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador in a similar vein receive primary benefits of their offshore oil and gas.</ParaText><ParaText id="688994">People have talked about special deals. This is not a special deal. This is the same sort of deal, others have mentioned this, historically in the context as Alberta enjoys with respect to their underground oil and gas. The Auto Pact could be singled out for the province of Ontario as something specific to it. Quebec has similar deals, one in fact that affects Newfoundland and Labrador, which is quite contentious. That is of course Churchill Falls.</ParaText><ParaText id="688995">Therefore, this is about ensuring fairness. That is exactly what we intend to do. The budget is exactly about that. Liberals have repeatedly refused in the past to recognize accords such as this.</ParaText><ParaText id="688996">The bill itself, when it finally came to fruition, when it finally came before the House, put in place a recognition of natural gas revenues that were to come to the province of Nova Scotia.</ParaText>

Why was the member opposite misleading the people of Nova Scotia by trying to represent that budget deal that was not a good deal, that would have cost our province hundreds of millions of dollars? He championed that cause. He repeatedly publicly urged our province to sign onto a deal that would have cost us hundreds of millions of dollars. </ParaText><ParaText id="689018">We know that he is voting against a budget that will give the province $95 million more, so he can talk about the past.

He did not leave the ice. He was kicked out for standing up strongly behind the accord.</ParaText><ParaText id="689022">The Atlantic accord anticipated precisely the situation in which we might find ourselves today, and that is precisely why the accord explicitly says in clause 4 that Nova Scotia does not have to choose. The accord says that Nova Scotia gets the full accord benefits whatever equalization is in place at the time, but what that does not take into account is that what was promised has actually been broken. </ParaText><ParaText id="689023">The accord has been broken, and so no matter how many times the government says Nova Scotia is going to get more benefits, the issue is not whether there are going to be more benefits, the issue is whether Nova Scotia is going to end up being forced to make a choice where it would in part forfeit benefits that were promised.

That is, by the way, what equalization is meant to do. It is meant to recognize the circumstances that exist in regions such as ours. It is meant to give people in Nova Scotia an opportunity to stay and work, and be in their communities and towns and cities, rather than have to take the option to go out west to work.</ParaText><ParaText id="689029">I hope to see the day when the trend is reversed and Nova Scotians and Atlantic Canadians are coming home in droves because there will be jobs there.

We believe in the need to capitalize on the strengths the provinces have to the benefit of all of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="689039">It was with great pride that I watched the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Finance Minister </Affiliation> deliver his budget in the House last March. Budget 2007, of course, was described as a historic agreement and with very good reason. I am particularly proud to note that our approach to open federalism and restoring fiscal balance is the result of significant consultations with all of the provinces and territories, as we committed to last year in our budget 2006.</ParaText><ParaText id="689040">It was in the spirit of open federalism that we worked with every province and territory, and we sought their views on ways to help achieve a balance between a principled based approach to the limitation of our spending powers and the need to ensure flexibility in our country.

							<ParaText id="689041">However, we have to be clear about where we were when our government came to power. Canada was in a situation where the Liberal approach to equalization created, as we know, division between the federal and provincial governments, and between the provinces, particularly between different regions of our country.

We concluded that the O'Brien report formed a solid foundation for the renewal of the equalization program.</ParaText><ParaText id="689046">As we know, in our budget 2007, we finally tackled the longstanding irritant of provinces called double equalization by committing finally to a principled move to per capita health and social transfers. With this move we clearly demonstrate a principle that the equalization formula itself is meant to address interprovincial and interregional disparities, while other federal transfers, like health and social transfers, should ensure equal treatment of Canadians in all parts of our country. We also advanced the principles of transparency and accountability.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689047">As we know, the provinces have responsibilities and ultimate accountability in their own fields and in their own areas of jurisdiction, while the federal government offers clear and predictable support to them.

I am pleased because this debate affords me the opportunity to speak about this important topic while raising issues such as fairness, justice, truthfulness and honesty. Some people might argue that terms such as these may be a bit flowery for the often arcane statistical language one uses when speaking about Canada's complex equalization formula.

While I may not agree with the New Democratic premier of Saskatchewan and many of his ideological positions, as a proud resident of that great province I admire his tenacity and the way in which he represents honesty and integrity.</ParaText><ParaText id="689091">Some have argued that his campaign is to bring attention to the Conservative government's betrayal of Saskatchewan as simple posturing, an attempt to shift attention away from his own government's issues and place blame on Ottawa's politicians. Like some of my colleagues in the House, I certainly would not try to know the thoughts or motivations of Mr. Calvert, but I am proud to say that I agree with his logic on this issue 100%.</ParaText><ParaText id="689092">Simply, a promise was made to Saskatchewan and a promise was broken to Saskatchewan. It appears as though promises were made to Canadians and to the people of Saskatchewan simply to mislead for political gain. When a political party or a government misleads the electorate, the political games are short-lived. Canadians do not like to be used for a political party's or MP's personal gain.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689093">I am disappointed in what I have heard coming from the Conservative Party's Saskatchewan members of Parliament when this subject is discussed. Never in my time in public life, whether here in Ottawa or in first nations government and education have I been a witness to such deceit and breach of trust when people are placed in a position of prominence whereby their actions could help raise awareness of a great injustice and yet decide to sit mutely and do as they are told. Indeed it is a great tragedy.</ParaText><ParaText id="689094">Promises were made to the people of Saskatchewan by the Conservatives regarding the equalization formula, promises that were wilfully not kept, promises to remove non-renewable resources from the formula, promises not to claw back resource revenues and promises to ensure that as Saskatchewan further develops its resources its residents are not penalized for their success. </ParaText><ParaText id="689095">In some ways Saskatchewan has had a rough go of it in recent times vis-à-vis its neighbours, especially Alberta and British Columbia.

Really, as they see what is really at play here, we can say that it is important to all Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="689131">During her speech earlier, the <Affiliation DbId="78678" Type="2">Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs</Affiliation> indicated that what the government wanted to do was go back to a principled application of the equalization formula. It was to be based on principle, and I think it was framed fairly well today in the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, which reflected on the Groucho Marx line about principles: “Those are my principles, and if you don't like them...well, I have others”. </ParaText><ParaText id="689132">The principle at play here is that the federal government made a commitment to the people of Nova Scotia and made a commitment to the people of Newfoundland and Labrador and signed a contract. The government is walking away from that commitment. It is breaking the deal. That is the principle here. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689133">I think it is important that we get back to what this meant to the people of Nova Scotia and the people of Newfoundland and Labrador.</ParaText><ParaText id="689134"> I can speak firsthand to the situation in Nova Scotia because I was there in February 2005. After many months of negotiation, the accord was signed by the premier at the time, John Hamm, and his minister, Cecil Clarke, representing the province of Nova Scotia, our fisheries minister at the time, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78801" Type="2">Halifax West</Affiliation>, and our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. The signing of that accord was monumental.</ParaText><ParaText id="689135"> The people of Nova Scotia said that was the single greatest day in Nova Scotia since oil and gas were discovered off the coast. That is how important this was to the people of Nova Scotia.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689136">It was a promise made by our former prime minister, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78571" Type="2">LaSalle—Émard</Affiliation>, and he went beyond the promise. He promised Nova Scotians and Newfoundlanders and Labradorians full access to their offshore revenues, but he went beyond that and cut an upfront cheque for each province.</ParaText><ParaText id="689137"> That amounted to $800 million for the province of Nova Scotia, a significant amount. As for the debt situation that we were in at the time, we carried more debt per capita than any other province. That debt was a ball and chain. It was weighing us down as a province.</ParaText><ParaText id="689138"> Our premier at the time applied the $800 million to the $12 billion debt that the province of Nova Scotia was carrying. I totally supported the premier on that decision. In doing that right thing, he brought down the annual interest in the province of Nova Scotia by between $40 million and $50 million annually. That $40 million or $50 million goes into highways, hospitals and education. It benefits all Nova Scotians. That was the right thing to do. It was honourable of our former prime minister to do to make sure that money was issued upfront.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689139">Just so members understand, what the accord did was make sure that the clawback provisions from equalization were no longer applied. There were no more clawback provisions through equalization because of the offshore revenues. It was meant to be a building block so that Nova Scotia could move from being a have not province to a have province. There is activity in the economy in Nova Scotia, but the accord was in essence the foundation, a building block, and then, with the equalization on top, suddenly the revenues started to make some sense. The province was able to start getting at that debt that we continue to carry and that continues to be a burden on the people of Nova Scotia.</ParaText><ParaText id="689140">However, what happened when the budget was tabled was that the rug was pulled out from under the feet of Nova Scotians. The foundation was removed with the pulling out of the accord. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="55">(1655)</Timestamp><ParaText id="689141">The comments that are coming from the government today are about how “they can have one or they can have the other”. That was never the deal. This was both. This was the accord. This was equalization and no provision of clawbacks. Indeed, when we held government, we did increase the amount of equalization through a change in the formula. We increased the amount of equalization to the province of Nova Scotia and there was no impact on the accord. It in no way compromised the accord. This could be done. We know that this is not what happened in this case.</ParaText><ParaText id="689142"> Numbers get bandied about in the House. In order for us to get a true view of it, let me mention that I read a great op-ed article a number of weeks back. It was from Peter O'Brien, the former Atlantic representative on the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. He was never a great friend of the Liberal Party of Canada, by any means, and when there was an issue he would take issue with the government.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689143">However, in regard to his position on this aspect of the budget, the accord, he said that when it was first announced the message coming from the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and the regional minister was, “Hey, this is all good, there is no change, no cap, and no compromising the Atlantic accord”. He took it at face value. In the article, he goes on to talk about two of this country's strongest and most respected economists, Wade Locke, from Memorial University in Newfoundland, and Paul Hobson, from Acadia University in Wolfville, Nova Scotia.</ParaText><ParaText id="689144">Mr. O'Brien has been in a number of prebudget lockups with these gentlemen. He said that their work is exemplary and he trusts them completely. Mr. O'Brien said that by Wade Locke identifying and going through the process, and showing that the province of Newfoundland and Labrador will lose $11 billion with these changes and the province of Nova Scotia will lose a billion dollars with these changes, he knows that what he was getting from the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and the regional minister was nothing but spin. The truth is that both of those provinces lose with the changes that are made to this accord, and that is truly shameful. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689145">We have heard about this throughout this debate since the budget was tabled. I remember the day it was tabled. We were on our feet on this side of the House questioning the government about the impacts on the accord for both Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador. We knew there was going to be a net loss to the citizens of those two provinces, but the government said no, that was not the way it was at all. It said that this is great, we do not compromise anything, and they end up coming out ahead.</ParaText><ParaText id="689146">Then, when there was a unanimous resolution that came from the legislature in Nova Scotia, an all party resolution that called for the government to reinstitute the accord, those guys stood up and said, “Hey, there's no problem, it's all good”. </ParaText><ParaText id="689147">The government sent its <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> to meet with the finance minister for Nova Scotia. They had a six hour meeting. That is no reflection of us being slow learners in Nova Scotia. It is because the finance minister for the province of Nova Scotia knew what it had lost under the changes in the government's budget.</ParaText><ParaText id="689148">Then, of course, yesterday was the big day when this thing all came to a head. We saw what went on with the member for <Affiliation DbId="78829" Type="2">Cumberland—Colchester—Musquodoboit Valley</Affiliation>. We saw the arm-twisting that went on.

							<ParaText id="689174">At the time, the opposition said that the Liberal government was wrong because it did not want to give the Atlantic provinces and Saskatchewan a chance. Now we have a government that thinks it has all of the answers and knows everything.

I am sure that the member for <Affiliation DbId="78918" Type="2">Cape Breton—Canso</Affiliation> remembers this well. In 1997, few Liberals were re-elected in the Atlantic provinces.

The fact that there is finally a special accord for Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, the country's poorest provinces, is nothing for the Atlantic provinces to get excited about.</ParaText><ParaText id="689177">Having been kicked in the behind by the Liberals with their employment insurance cuts, a riding like mine is losing $81 million a year in employment insurance benefits, and people are having to go work in Alberta. They must leave their families, their wives and their children, who miss their fathers. The family is split up.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689178">The Conservatives said that if they were elected, they would give us this and we would have that. The Liberals were scared of these promises and gave it to us in 2005. Now, the Conservatives are coming and taking it away. There was a light at the end of the tunnel, but it was just a little fluorescent light, and it ran out of power.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp><ParaText id="689179"> The light has gone out. They have lost the light again. That is what has happened in Atlantic Canada. Have we not suffered enough? We lost our fishing industry. It is not the fault of the people in Atlantic Canada that the fishery has been lost. The people earned their pay. They went fishing and they tried to earn income to provide for the needs of their families. In the final analysis, there were no more fish. All this has hurt them. Families have gone through many difficulties. In addition, the Liberals slashed employment insurance. They decided to punish fishers even more, and the Conservatives supported them. The only thing the Conservatives said was that premiums were too high and they would lower the premiums because companies were paying too much, but they could not give benefits to the workers. That is what has happened. Finally, there was an agreement. I have spoken about the fishery but the fishery was not the only issue. At Bathurst, in my riding, the Smurfit-Stone paper plant, an industry that had been there for 100 years, has closed its doors. </ParaText><ParaText id="689180"> This week, UPN announced that the Miramichi plant will close in August for nine or perhaps 12 months and 600 people will be put out of work. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689181"> New Brunswick says that if Nova Scotia can straighten out its finances and become prosperous; if Newfoundland can do the same; and if New Brunswick can draw people back to their home province, perhaps it too will benefit. Perhaps New Brunswick could work with Nova Scotia if that province is more prosperous. </ParaText><ParaText id="689182"> But no, the government is not able to give us a chance to establish a climate of economic development. It cannot give us that chance. It is not able to give us a chance to survive. I think, perhaps, that is the plan. </ParaText><ParaText id="689183"> They want to crush us. They say that if we do not want to be crushed, we need only move to Alberta, where there is an abundance of work. They say our country’s economic system is working well. If it is working, it is in Alberta. I am happy for Albertans. I am not jealous of them. But we should not be obliged to leave our region. We have a right in our country to earn our fair share and to receive assistance. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689184">If the provinces cannot help each other out within federalism, then what is the point? It is at times like this that we can see why the Bloc Québécois or Quebec wonders why it should stay in this country. They are given ample reason to say such things. When we are treated the way the federal government is treating us, we wonder what we are doing within a confederation, within a federation.</ParaText><ParaText id="689185">If this keeps up, we may have to form a Bloc Acadien. Then maybe the government will pump money to us, like it does elsewhere. We will not have oil wells like in Alberta, but we will have a pipeline that goes from Ottawa straight to Acadia. Maybe then we will not have 20% unemployment. Maybe then people back home will have work.</ParaText><ParaText id="689186">Does anyone think these things are pleasant? Does anyone think people are happy to see how the government treats them? It made a promise. It made a promise to Nova Scotia. It made a promise to Newfoundland. It signed the Atlantic accord, but it did not say it would take it away. It is acting like a grandparent. It thinks it knows everything and, as a grandparent, it is demanding respect.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689187">The <Affiliation DbId="78752" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> says that the Conservatives know they are doing the right thing, so why is the Premier of Nova Scotia saying that is not true? The Premier of Nova Scotia says it is not true. The Premier of Newfoundland also says this is not true.</ParaText><ParaText id="689188">The Conservatives signed an accord and contracts and these provinces want them to be respected. The only thing we are asking the Government of Canada to do is to respect these accords and respect a contract once it has been signed. It should not do what it just did. I hope the government will change its mind. An accord is an accord. The Conservatives should not breach this accord and force a member of their party to go the benches on the other side of the House of Commons. They should respect the accord and invite the member back.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We committed to respecting provincial jurisdiction and to clarifying roles and responsibilities. We also recognized the need for a comprehensive package of measures to restore the fiscal balance. </ParaText><ParaText id="689248">In budget 2006, and in other key pieces of legislation passed over the last year, we began to take concrete action.

The first step to making Canada even better tomorrow is to restore fiscal balance in this country today. It is not in defending turf, not in engaging in parochial politics and not in confronting for the sake of confrontation, but acting in the best interests of Canadians in all parts of this country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689250">In the last few years there has been a lot of talk about fiscal balance but what is it really about? It is about better roads and renewed public transit, better health care, better equipped universities, cleaner oceans, rivers, lakes and air, and training to help Canadians get the skills they need. It is all about building a better future for our country. That means ensuring predictable long term funding to provincial and territorial governments.</ParaText><ParaText id="689251">Through budget 2007, we are delivering a historic plan worth over $39 billion in additional funding to restore fiscal balance in Canada. Restoring fiscal balance brings federal support for provinces and territories to an unprecedented level. </ParaText><ParaText id="689252">Unlike the previous Liberal government, which did not and still does not recognize the very existence of the fiscal imbalance, our plan is based on a clear set of principles: accountability through clarity of roles and responsibilities; fiscal responsibility and budgetary transparency; predictable long term fiscal arrangements; a competitive and efficient economic union; and effective collaborative management of the federation. Reflecting these principles, we have kept our commitments on equalization and on the Atlantic accord.</ParaText><ParaText id="689253"> In coming to office, Canada's new government promised to protect the Atlantic accord. Budget 2007 does just that. It provides 100% protection for the Atlantic accord signed in 2005. In fact, we are returning to a principled, formula-based equalization program. As we promised, every province will be better off under the new system.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689254">In moving to the new system, the budget took every action to fully protect the benefits of the Atlantic accord, consistent with our commitments and as requested by the Governments of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador. I want to be clear that both Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador can continue to operate under the existing equalization system for the life of the Atlantic accord, exactly the same system today and in the future as before the 2007 budget.</ParaText><ParaText id="689255">As long as these provinces continue to operate under the existing equalization program, there is absolutely no change to either the accord or the equalization calculation on which it is based. What is more, both provinces have been given the right to opt permanently into a new improved Canada-wide equalization system. </ParaText><ParaText id="689256">In particular, while the new equalization system automatically applies to the other eight provinces, both Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia have a choice. They can keep their existing arrangements or opt permanently into the new principled and formula-based equalization system when and if it becomes more advantageous for them over the remaining life of their Atlantic accords.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp><ParaText id="689257">Canada's new government went even further to facilitate that choice. The budget legislation also offers increased flexibility in making the transition to a new equalization system by giving both provinces a full year before deciding whether to opt permanently into the new system. </ParaText><ParaText id="689258">Simply put, we said that we would respect the Atlantic accord and we have taken every step to keep our word to the people of Nova Scotia and of Newfoundland and Labrador.</ParaText><ParaText id="689259">However, there is much more to restoring fiscal balance than just equalization. The actions taken in budget 2007 will restore fiscal balance, putting all major transfers back on a long term, fair and predictable basis. We are fulfilling our commitment to restoring equal per capita cash allocations in other major transfers to the provinces. </ParaText><ParaText id="689260">Starting in 2007-08, we will put the Canada social transfer payments on an equal per capita cash basis to ensure equal federal support to Canadians in all parts of the country for post-secondary education, social assistance and social services.</ParaText><ParaText id="689261">We are also committing to move the Canada health transfer to an equal per capita cash basis when the current arrangement expires in 2014. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689262">We are keeping our commitment to building Canada's future by improving our infrastructure. In fact, the government's investment in infrastructure is by far the largest component of the fiscal balance package. We are making an unprecedented investment in Canada's infrastructure of $16.3 billion in new funding, for a total of $37 billion over the next seven years.</ParaText><ParaText id="689263">These investments will be of particular importance to the future economic vitality of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador. Indeed, restoring fiscal balance brings federal support for Newfoundland and Labrador to more than $1.5 billion in 2007-08 and for Nova Scotia this totals more than $2.4 billion in those same years.</ParaText><ParaText id="689264">This includes equalization payments amounting to $477 million for Newfoundland and Labrador and over $1.3 billion for Nova Scotia, assuming these provinces choose to retain the previous equalization program on which their Atlantic accords are based.</ParaText><ParaText id="689265">Canada's new government is committed to abide by the principles it has set out and, in doing so, to demonstrate to Canadians and to their provincial and territorial governments that fiscal balance has not only been restored but that it will be maintained going forward.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689266">It is important to be clear about what this means. It means a commitment by the Government of Canada to reducing the burden on taxpayers, not only in line with the tax back guarantee, but also if and when future government revenues again come to exceed its responsibility, and if future governments believe their responsibilities have come to exceed their revenues, it means they should be accountable to taxpayers for raising the additional revenues they may need to raise.</ParaText><ParaText id="689267">Maintaining fiscal balance over the long term also means maintaining the government's commitment to long term, predictable funding in all areas that continue to share priorities of governments in all parts of this country. </ParaText><ParaText id="689268">It also means upholding the equitable treatment of Canadians in all parts of the country by: maintaining a formula based equalization program that applies the same principle based approach in all parts of the country; ensuring equal access to funding support for shared priorities in areas where needs are Canada-wide in nature; and continuing to respond to the sometimes very different needs of Canadians in different parts of the country for programs in areas of clear federal responsibility, including infrastructure projects of national importance.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689269">Having restored fiscal balance and put in place the principle based approach that will help maintain it, it is now time for Canadians in all parts of the country to do their part in moving the country forward by working together to secure and expand our advantages as set out by the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> in the advantage Canada economic plan.</ParaText><ParaText id="689270">These advantages include a fiscal advantage grounded in the goal of eliminating Canada's total government net debt in less than a generation. It includes an infrastructure advantage based on modern, world-class infrastructure to ensure the seamless flow of people, goods and services within Canada and through our gateways and border crossings to the world beyond.</ParaText>

The member doubts that the government has honoured its commitments. I can assure the House that nothing could be further from the truth.</ParaText><ParaText id="689286">Budget 2007 provides important benefits to the people of Nova Scotia as part of the Government of Canada's commitment to fair and equitable financial support for provincial and territorial health care, post-secondary education, child care, social programs and infrastructure. </ParaText><ParaText id="689287">Budget 2007 does even more. Nova Scotia will continue to receive 100% of offshore resource revenues, including royalties, as if these resources were on land. This fundamental aspect of Nova Scotia's relationship with its offshore resources, its ability to manage the resource, to tax and collect the royalties remains the same. This will help Nova Scotia to develop its economic potential and ensure its future prosperity.</ParaText><ParaText id="689288">Let me remind the House that it was a Conservative government that signed the 1986 Canada-Nova Scotia offshore petroleum resources accord, which facilitated the development of the oil and gas reserves off the coast of Nova Scotia. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689289">In specific terms, budget 2007 will allow the governments of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador to continue to enjoy the benefits of their 2005 offshore accords. Again, I remind the House that it was a Conservative opposition that forced the previous government to sign these agreements. The accords are unique in Canada in recognition of the provinces' unique economic and fiscal circumstances. </ParaText><ParaText id="689290">Budget 2007 offers Nova Scotia a positive choice for the future. It can operate under the existing equalization formula, or it can choose to opt into the new equalization formula based on the O'Brien report, if and when the province determines this as being most advantageous. By having this additional choice, Nova Scotia potentially stands to receive even higher benefits than under the existing formula while retaining its right to offset payments under the accords.</ParaText><ParaText id="689291"> Of course, if the Nova Scotia government chooses the new equalization formula, it is only fair that the whole package would apply, including the fiscal capacity cap that is an integral part of the new equalization formula. It would not be fair to other provinces if only Nova Scotia were allowed to choose those parts of the new equalization program that benefit the province.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689292">Finally, Nova Scotia has been given additional flexibility beyond what was set out in budget 2007. Bill <Document DbId="2801101" Type="3">C-52</Document> would allow Nova Scotia to benefit from the new O'Brien formula for 2007-08 and provides more time to assess whether it wants to permanently opt into the new equalization formula. This option has given Nova Scotia an additional $95 million, for total benefits of $1.5 billion in 2007-08. Under this arrangement Nova Scotia will receive its full offset payments under the offshore accords.</ParaText><ParaText id="689293">One can begin to see the difference where it matters. In April 2007 Nova Scotia's labour force participation rate of 64% was close to a 30 year high and full time jobs have increased by 2.5% over a year ago. The economy is strong in Nova Scotia.</ParaText><ParaText id="689294">Canada is a sharing community. Nova Scotia's growing prosperity is in part due to strong federal support and is something to celebrate.

I think it helps to explain why the Conservatives gave up on their plans earlier this year to engineer a premature spring election in Canada. They very much wanted to call one. They doled out more than $12 billion for pre-election government spending to buy votes through January, February and into March. They added another $4 million for some very abusive attack advertising. Their budget was delayed to suit their election timing. They thought they would use it to launch a campaign about the middle of March. However, then everything began to fall apart.</ParaText><ParaText id="689320"> The budget, instead of launching, landed with a dull thud. It confirmed increases in personal income taxes, and that was not popular with Canadians. It slashed things like student summer jobs, which has been debated extensively in the House about the disappointment across the country among both the employers and the employees. The budget mangled the funding for aboriginal people, for foreign aid, in Africa especially, for the fight against climate change and, quite surprisingly, it reduced federal help for farmers.</ParaText><ParaText id="689321"> The budget demonstrated utter Conservative incompetence on issues like the hollowing out of Canadian enterprise, and it broke promises left, right and centre.

These provinces were given explicit and written promises by the leader of the Conservative Party, now the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and incidentally by every Conservative candidate.</ParaText><ParaText id="689325">In Atlantic Canada, the Conservative promise was to respect the spirit and the letter of the Atlantic accords as they were signed in February 2005.</ParaText><ParaText id="689326">In Saskatchewan, the promise was to calculate the province's entitlement to equalization, as if Saskatchewan had no provincial revenue whatsoever from oil and gas. The Conservatives were good enough to calculate exactly what that promise to Saskatchewan would mean. They promised an extra $800 million in equalization benefits to Saskatchewan every year.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689327"> I point out that when the finance committee made the opportunity available for the Premier of Saskatchewan to be heard on this matter, he read into the record chapter and verse of the Conservative speeches, the Conservative pamphlets, the Conservative promises that made the point absolutely crystal clear. There were no ifs, ands or buts. It was absolutely unmistakable, absolutely unequivocal. It was in writing and in every Conservative speech about Saskatchewan for more than two full years. Then out of the blue, on budget day 2007, it all came to a crashing halt. Saskatchewan was sucker punched.</ParaText><ParaText id="689328"> I should point out that these promises, which had been accumulating on the part of the Conservatives, have been accumulating, as I said a moment ago, over a period of two years. When the election came and went and the Conservatives were elected in January 2006, Saskatchewan people anticipated that this would be, that is the promise to Saskatchewan, one of the very first things with which the newly elected government would be dealing.</ParaText><ParaText id="689329"> It did not appear in the throne speech. It did not appear in its first budget. The government said that it would have to wait for first ministers meetings and for other negotiations. Therefore, Saskatchewan put its expectations on hold.

							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp><ParaText id="689330">Therefore, there was no action in the fall of 2006, so Saskatchewan put its expectations on hold again and deferred its waiting period until the budget of 2007.

Why?</ParaText><ParaText id="689331">The problem is very much the same as the problem that afflicted the promise to Atlantic Canada with the Atlantic accords. A never before mentioned Conservative cap on how much Saskatchewan could gain was suddenly imposed in the budget of 2007. That cap effectively guts the entire promise to Saskatchewan.</ParaText><ParaText id="689332">My province will get about $226 million once this year and this year only, then it is over.

Between 2004 and 2005, Liberal changes to how equalization works brought in to Saskatchewan an extra $799 million in direct equalization benefits over those two years. That was the biggest equalization bonus in history.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689334">We also increased other federal transfers to the provinces to an all time record high level, and Saskatchewan, like all provinces, benefited from that. We invested and put into the financial projections of the Government of Canada another $100 billion in steadily increasing federal transfers over the coming decade, particularly for health care and equalization, but also for a number of other things like child care, for example.</ParaText><ParaText id="689335">When the Conservatives arrived in office, they reduced or cancelled a broad range of federal transfers, programs and services for Saskatchewan and its citizens. We lost funding for child care, for student aid, for workplace training, for rural roads, for farmers and for aboriginal people. The net loss, after we add in the few trinkets and bells and whistles invented by the Conservative government, after we add in all the puts and takes, is $250 million per year. </ParaText><ParaText id="689336">The Conservatives have made what they call the fiscal imbalance worse for Saskatchewan, not better. The net result is to take money away. However, that, of course, was all to be fixed by this new hypothetical equalization formula that they were working on and that would be forthcoming in the budget of 2007, except whatever new formula is used, the Conservative cap still applies and that cap effectively cuts Saskatchewan off at the knees.</ParaText>

Yet, the member has the gall to stand up and make it appear that the Liberal Party is the great protector of Saskatchewan.

This increase is accounted for by increases of $11.7 billion in budgetary spending and $256.6 million in non-budgetary spending. However, when the 2007-08 main estimates are compared to the total 2006-07 estimates, including supplementary estimates (A) and (B), the year over year increase in total projected spending is $2.3 billion or only 1.1%.</ParaText><ParaText id="689397">Why are the main estimates so important?

I am making a very public plea here to ask the hon. member to go to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and ask for the reinstatement of those funds.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689433">The member mentioned a whole lot of programs, and there is no doubt a lot of good in those programs. I am not downplaying that in any way, shape or form. However, the second program is literacy, a program that is hurting every community across Canada because of the cuts. The government cut a lot of money from literacy programs. As a past literacy provider, I can tell members that it is hurting some of our most vulnerable people, people who are in jobs and who cannot read, who have difficulty, who cannot progress and who are having trouble. There are young moms who need to administer medicines properly to their children but they cannot read. </ParaText><ParaText id="689434">The government has put a lot of people at risk by attacking those two programs.</ParaText><ParaText id="689435">My plea today is to ask the member to go to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and ask him to reinstate money for Big Brothers and for literacy. When we attack the ordinary, everyday person who is part of the Canadian fabric, who we are supposed to represent, we, the government, make a grievous error. I plead today for the reinstatement of these two programs.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

On the first one, regarding Big Brothers Big Sisters, I appreciate her offer to go back and do a little bit of investigating to see where that program stands and to see if in fact what she has stated is the case.</ParaText><ParaText id="689438"> However, I do want to make note of something she mentioned about Big Brothers Big Sisters. In my riding of St. Catharines, Big Brothers Big Sisters do great work. One of the many positive components of the Canada summer job programs for students is that, maybe in the member's riding but certainly in my riding, young people are participating in the program, and Big Brothers Big Sisters was one of the programs that benefited in my community. I anticipate that across the province and across the country that is also the case, showing clearly that this government shows support for Big Brothers Big Sisters. However, I take her point and certainly will look into it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689439">I will comment briefing on adult literacy. I certainly share her point, her goal and her feelings about adult literacy. It is very important in terms of adults who do not have or have not had the opportunity to learn. However, in terms of funding, we have addressed those issues, maybe not in the program that she formerly stated but let me just show from budget 2006 that we invested an additional $350 million per year in aboriginal funding for education.</ParaText><ParaText id="689440"> We also made sure that within that there was a priority that additional funds, which did not exist in any previous budgets, would certainly be there to try to address those issues of youth and ensuring that our young people, certainly aboriginal young people, have the opportunity to learn to read and write, but at the same time also ensuring that the help is there for aboriginal adults who need it. It was there in 2006 and obviously it is there in 2007 as well. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I will make a small correction. Port Rupert does not exist. The funding for the Port of Prince Rupert was provided by the previous government with much insistence from this corner. I am not sure if the Conservative government is trying to take credit for the money but that is what governments do. </ParaText><ParaText id="689442">This brings me to my point around the environmental spending my colleague talked about. The government, by its own admission, misunderstood and much underplayed the issue of the environment for Canadians. We were slightly surprised by the vehemence of the reaction from the Canadian public when the government did not come forward with more progressive ideas. The government dragged its feet on greenhouse gases and spent most of its first 12 months blaming the previous regime's performance. </ParaText><ParaText id="689443">We initially did not have a problem with this because we in the NDP have consistently said that the previous government was not performing well when it came to climate change, but yet offered the Conservative government no excuse. Previous Liberal failures do not condone present Conservative failures when it comes to greenhouse gases.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689444">The member talked about the ecotrust funding. It is just by coincidence that today department officials were in front of committee. We asked them if the money had been spent because the minister had stood in his place and said the money had gone out the door. He said the cheques were not just signed, not just in the mail, but they had been cashed. However, when we checked with the provinces, no one had seen any of the money. There seems to be an enormous discrepancy here. The minister is taking much credit for all these environmental initiatives when the money has not gone out the door.</ParaText><ParaText id="689445">There is not a single string attached to this money so that it will actually lead to reductions in greenhouse gases, further continuing Canada's deplorable record on greenhouse gas emissions and delaying action from other countries.</ParaText><ParaText id="689446">Before the government actually takes credit for programs and spending on initiatives, it seems to me that it would be wise that it actually spend the money. When those members were in opposition, I know they were paying attention to the Liberal government's tendency to re-spend and re-announce and re-announce until it was beating a dead horse, but I would resist the temptation if I were that member. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689447">It seems to me that Canadians need to know what has happened. The environmental initiatives and the ecotrust funding have not happened. The money has not been spent. The money has not been delivered. The provinces have not seen it.</ParaText><ParaText id="689448">I wonder if my colleague could take this opportunity to clarify the record. I know he does not wish to mislead Canadians or those who are watching, but I wonder if he would like to correct the record here in the House to ensure we actually understand what is afoot.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I take my colleague's comments about whether or not it is our job to blame previous governments, or whether it is our job to address those issues. I will not even talk about casting blame, but I will talk about what our commitments to Kyoto were supposed to be and what has not happened in the past number of years. </ParaText><ParaText id="689451">Obviously, to take the type of approach that the member's party would like to take would certainly bring this country's economy to its knees. That is not our intent. That is not going to be our approach. We have set money aside. We have put money in the budget. We have developed programs, including “Turning the Corner”, which speaks specifically to the issues that the member spoke to.</ParaText><ParaText id="689452">If this budget does not pass through the Senate, the money that is booked to be spent on the environment will need to come out of this year. The difficulty that the member speaks about is a fair one in terms of where that revenue is going to come from, where it is going to go, how much is going to be spent and where it is going to be allocated.</ParaText>

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Sgro" id="2138229"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78669" Type="2">Hon. Judy Sgro (York West, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="689454">Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure tonight to talk about the estimates. I will be sharing my time with my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78531" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="689455">We all know that these debates are very important. For the benefit of the many Canadians who are watching at home, I would like to begin by explaining that this evening we are debating estimates. We are talking tonight about the money that is being spent, but we are also going to talk about the money that is not being spent. I expect we will hear that clearly from that side of the House by the minority Conservative government.</ParaText><ParaText id="689456">It is important to remind Canadians that the Conservatives inherited from our great Liberal government the best fiscal situation in the history of Canada. Back in 1993 when the Liberals took over as government from the Conservatives, what we inherited to the great surprise to those who were elected at the time was something like a $42 billion deficit. The country was almost at a point of bankruptcy for a variety of reasons. Certainly fiscal mismanagement was a big part of that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689457">We made a lot of commitments of things that we had wanted to do. Then we got into government and found out that it was impossible. It took years of constraints, of having to cut programs and for Canadians having to cope with all of that while we attempted to get the government out of the deficit position it was in. It was a difficult time.</ParaText><ParaText id="689458">In contrast to the Conservative government of today, when the Conservatives got in they found an $11 billion surplus. That is a very different thing. They had lots of money to throw around in a lot of places. That is part of the reason for the discussion tonight about some of the areas into which I would like to have seen them put some more money.</ParaText><ParaText id="689459">Unfortunately, the minority Conservative government has preferred to cut many of the important programs, those that were Liberal, and they will reintroduce them under the Conservative name. Whatever they are called, they were good programs. A lot of them are being reintroduced under the Conservative logo because they were good programs. We knew what the needs of Canadians were. We were out there with our full intention to meet the needs of Canadians and to give Canadian individuals and communities the necessary tools.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689460">Many of the funding cuts made by the Conservatives, in spite of the surplus that the Conservatives had, targeted women in particular, students, many people who are in need of affordable housing and other groups for which the Conservatives have traditionally shown very little concern.</ParaText><ParaText id="689461">Some $5 million was cut from Status of Women Canada. This is an organization that was established by the Liberal government just a couple of years ago, in order to give women more opportunities to be advocates for the needs of women in Canada, and to make sure that women's voices were being heard loud and clear.</ParaText><ParaText id="689462">There was $45 million cut from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation programs. This was done at a time when we are hearing more and more about the needs for affordable housing throughout the country. We had a minister of housing under the previous Liberal government who was working with the provinces to ensure that affordable housing would be built throughout our country. We had committed around $675 million to the province of Ontario alone to build affordable housing and $45 million was cut from that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689463">There was $10 million cut with the elimination of the support for the Canadian volunteerism initiative. That is a really difficult one, given that volunteerism is such an important part of Canadian society today. So many people volunteer the utmost amount of hours. If we had to, we would never have enough money to pay people for all of what they do.</ParaText><ParaText id="689464">There was $10 million cut with the elimination of the international youth internship program. This was a wonderful opportunity for young people to travel abroad to learn more about other countries and the rest of the world.</ParaText><ParaText id="689465">The Conservatives cut $6 million from the Canada Firearms Centre. They cut $18 million from youth employment initiatives. We are hearing about that through the summer employment programs. There is a great need for youth employment initiatives to provide opportunities for our young people to talk about careers and focus on where they will go in the future.</ParaText><ParaText id="689466">There was $18 million cut from the literacy skills program. It is unbelievable the number of people who still cannot read and write in Canada. If we truly want to see people in Canada aspire to be a successful citizen, they need to be able to read and write.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="00">(1900)</Timestamp><ParaText id="689467">To cut the money out of programs that are the fundamental basics that we need to have a successful country frankly was unbelievable.</ParaText><ParaText id="689468">The court challenges program, another $6 million, was looked upon as not necessary. If it was not for the court challenges program we probably would not have the Charter of Rights and Freedoms today. These cuts are from programs that are very important in the lives of Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="689469">Let us talk about child care and all the spaces that were not produced. What is early learning all about? Early learning is not about child care. Early learning is about investing in our youngsters from the very beginning so that we can plan a positive future for them. That came out as a result of a lot of work that was done across this country through a variety of agencies talking about how to ensure that our children can compete with those in countries abroad that are investing a lot of money in their children. That was the first social program specifically geared to early learning and child care that was going to put our children at a real advantage over many of the others.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689470">A lot of evidence has proven that early learning contributes immensely to the development of children and helps to give children the best start in life. Canada needs a high quality early learning and child care system, and I am not talking about a babysitting system. Early learning is very important for our precious children to get the best possible start. They need the highest quality early learning opportunities that we can provide in order to ensure that our children can grow and prosper.</ParaText><ParaText id="689471">Ever since the election of the minority Conservative government, child care and early learning have suffered immensely. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s so-called universal child care plan is not child care. It is an allowance, much like the baby bonus that people used to receive, and it is a meagre one at that. It is taxable. It is unaccountable. Certainly it is not a plan, by any means.</ParaText><ParaText id="689472">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> promised to provide funding for 125,000 new child care spaces. I can still hear the Prime Minister to this day saying how the Conservatives were going to produce 125,000 child care spaces. I have not seen one created yet. Once he got into power he so desperately wanted to cut the funds to child care. The Conservatives have not created one space that they can talk about.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689473">The previous Liberal government had committed to give every child a good start in life. It invested $5 billion over five years for the creation of a Canada-wide system of early learning and child care based on the principles of quality, universal inclusiveness and accessibility, all very important principles.</ParaText><ParaText id="689474">Ten provinces had signed bilateral agreements to increase investments in early learning and child care. As a nation we were moving forward with our plans to create a new national system. Just getting 10 provinces to agree on something like that was a huge amount of work and something that we all desired. We had to give it time to come to fruition and we also had to have the money. It took that long to get it all together and organized. Sadly, the Conservative government cancelled all of the agreements and undid all of the good work that had been done.</ParaText><ParaText id="689475">Cutting literacy programs, as I indicated earlier, is another heartless act by the government. Literacy reaches far and wide. To foster a healthy, vibrant economy, we must ensure that our population has strong literacy skills. If Canada is to maintain its place in the world, we must improve literacy skills, especially for our most vulnerable citizens. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689476">How can the Conservative government justify cutting $17.7 million in funding from the adult learning and literary skills program? I have not heard anybody justify it yet. The Conservatives simply say they are reinvesting it differently, and so on and so forth. I have not seen them produce a specific program to indicate they are helping adults who are suffering from literacy issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="689477">One of the Conservatives' targets is the Status of Women Canada which I mentioned earlier, which has long been on the hit list of social Conservatives. They cut the Status of Women's budget by $5 million, compromising the agency's ability to do important work and to allow for the advocacy of women and women's issues. The minority Conservative government's decision to close 12 regional offices of the Status of Women Canada leaving only four to serve Canadian women is reprehensible. </ParaText><ParaText id="689478">Canadian women are still only earning 71¢ for every dollar earned by their male counterparts. More and more women are living in poverty and we are still waiting for the government to create child care spaces. The Conservatives stood here and argued with us and said they were so proud of the 125,000 spaces they were going to create. I am looking forward to hearing, and we may hear it tonight in this discussion, where those spaces are and when we can see the official opening of those spaces. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="05">(1905)</Timestamp><ParaText id="689479">With the closure of the regional offices of the Status of Women, the government is taking away one of the very few remaining resources for women to get the kind of assistance that they need. It will also take away the government's ability to be aware of what are the issues facing women today and what is the government's role in ensuring that women have full access to opportunity. </ParaText><ParaText id="689480">That is the reason these 12 offices were created across Canada. These offices were established to assist women in advocating for equality. Clearly, the Conservative government is against that goal of equality just by the kind of cuts that it is making.</ParaText><ParaText id="689481">This year we celebrated the 25th anniversary of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, something that I believe every one of us in this House is very proud of. The Conservatives have undermined the charter at every turn. Clearly, by cancelling the court challenges program and the Law Commission of Canada, by endangering judicial independence, and by trying to stack the courts, I do not think they believe in it at all.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689482"> A Liberal government would reverse the steps the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has taken to weaken the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which we all stand by, which is there to defend each and every one of us.</ParaText><ParaText id="689483">The charter is the centrepiece of Canadian democracy. Its legacy is too precious for us to remain indifferent to those who would seek to undermine it. The Liberal opposition will not permit the charter to be weakened by a federal government not committed to keeping it accessible to the Canadian people. </ParaText><ParaText id="689484">We will continue to fight the cuts to the court challenges program, as there are other groups clearly doing the exact same thing because they understand the value of it. It had been cut some years back by the previous Mulroney government and I gather after about five years of protests the Conservatives reinstated the program because they realized just how important that was. For such a small amount of money of $6 million it delivers a huge amount of opportunity for people to be able to get their points across.</ParaText><ParaText id="689485">No wonder Canadians do not trust this government. From politicizing the public service and cancelling the court challenges program to stacking the judiciary, and undermining the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, this government's ideological attacks are designed to reshape Canada to fit its narrow neo-conservative views.</ParaText>

It is all about that.</ParaText><ParaText id="689497">The Conservatives clearly have their priorities and their ideology and will function that way. The Liberals want to ensure that we build a healthy Canada. When the Liberal government had to make the cuts because we had the huge deficit to deal with, all Canadians had to buckle in and live within those cuts. Once the money started coming back in, because the economy was doing well and so on, then we had the money to reinvest in people and those areas.</ParaText><ParaText id="689498"> However, the Conservatives have made cuts in areas of adult literacy, youth initiatives, summer career placement program and a whole lot of the other issues that matter to those folks who are in the lower income levels.

I spoke when the budget came down and I will repeat some of the points I made at that time.</ParaText><ParaText id="689507">I was thinking about the budget as I was preparing for tonight. I tried to think of an analogy of what the budget was. What it reminds me of is a paint gun, one of those guns that shoot balls of paint. It is a big burst, it splatters everywhere and it makes a hell of a mess. I would make the analogy of this budget to a paint gun. It was a big burst but not a lot of meaningful initiatives for people and for many it left one big mess.</ParaText><ParaText id="689508">I will quickly go through some of the broken promises to my and your province, Mr. Speaker. It has been profoundly impacted negatively. We heard early from my colleague about the literacy program. We have heard about the women's program. We have heard about the closing of the women's office in the city of Winnipeg, which had been such a huge support to women's groups there.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689509">We have heard in previous times about the cancellation of the labour market partnership, a signed agreement with the Government of Canada, not with the Liberal Party, $129 million gone.</ParaText><ParaText id="689510">We have heard much about the court challenges program, in and of itself, and the merits of the program for women's groups, for other minority groups and for francophone groups. However, we have not talked about it in the context of the city of Winnipeg. It was one of the very few national programs in the city of Winnipeg and it too is gone.</ParaText><ParaText id="689511">On the homelessness initiative, we have heard much from members opposite about their great concern about crime and young people on the street. One of the members opposite even had the audacity to say that the streets of Winnipeg were, and I really do not want to repeat it, filled with uncharitable and unkind people who were lawless and involved in crime. </ParaText><ParaText id="689512">At the same time as they talk about crime, building jails, putting people behind bars and increasing the sentences, they are also cancelling funding for a major youth initiative that keeps young people off the streets. What one hand does, the other hand does not know. This has had a significant impact on my community and what it has done there.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689513">We have heard a lot about child care. My colleague who preceded me spoke about the impact of the loss of the child care program and the ineffectiveness of the $100 a month to families. We have heard much from members opposite about the importance of having choice.</ParaText><ParaText id="689514">I allege that one cannot have choice if there is no choice. What the government has basically done is removed choice for parents, the choice to go back to work, the choice to go back to school, the choice of where a child might be cared for. </ParaText><ParaText id="689515">In the city of Winnipeg, 80% of the centres have waiting lists. The province of Manitoba was slated to receive $176 million over five years. That program was cancelled. We now know, under the current allocation, the province of Manitoba will receive an annual $9 million grant, obviously considerably less than $174 million that would have been in place for the province of Manitoba.

As we all remember, this budget was tabled on March 19. </ParaText><ParaText id="689549"> There are some things in this budget that really need to be pointed out. Among friends, colleagues, political parties and taxpayers, we must describe things as they really are to improve conditions for the people of Canada and, when an error has been made, we should make every effort to correct it. As you well know, enlightenment comes when ideas collide. </ParaText><ParaText id="689550"> I want to talk about several points in the budget that deserve our attention. The first point deals with the Conservative government’s retention of the festival support program. I have had discussions today, and for several days, with representatives of volunteer groups and organizations which are organizing festivals planned for summer 2007. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689551"> This year, the federal government set aside $30 million for summer festivals. A large number of the organizers of these festivals have been told that the government—to be more precise, the Department of Canadian Heritage— is in the process of considering how the funds will be distributed. We are now into June and people have been told that it may be the fall before we have a clear answer on how the funds will be distributed. However, we must show some respect for the organizers of summer festivals in Quebec and elsewhere, because, after all, the seasons change. To find an analogy with what the Conservatives are doing, I think back to the Social Credit party. At one point, the Social Credit party said there were only four problems in Canada: spring, summer, fall and winter. Apart from that, everything would be fine. I must emphasize that summer festivals take place in the summer. An answer in the fall is of no use. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689552"> Specifically, I would like to underline the value of a festival. What does a festival mean to the population? Today, I debated with an economist from the Institut économique de Montréal. On a radio station in my riding, CJRC, not to mention names, I heard it said that—hold tight, Mr. Speaker, or you might fall off your chair—festivals were a means of preventing movie theatres from making money. The argument was that when people went to a festival, money was going to the wrong place. They added that festivals were not something very important in economic terms, because a dollar spent at one place is like a dollar spent at another place. A festival does not result in any value added. </ParaText><ParaText id="689553"> Well, I really had to answer that. I would like you, Mr. Speaker, and above all my colleagues opposite—the Conservatives, of course— to understand that a festival is a way for a city, a community or a region to become better known. A festival can attract people into the community, into the region. It gets people moving from one region to another to take part in activities. That makes our region better known, and, at the same time, it brings money into the region. </ParaText><ParaText id="689554"> For example, I think of the Festival de montgolfières in Gatineau, of which you are surely aware, and which for the past 20 years has taken place during the first weekend of September. It is celebrating its 20th anniversary in 2007. Last year, the festival generated revenue of $6 million. Since its creation, more than 3.3 million people have attended the festival. </ParaText><ParaText id="689555"> The federal government invests in these programs. I must also mention that the organizers of these festivals do not count solely on the support of the federal government. They do their own fund-raising at various levels. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="35">(1935)</Timestamp><ParaText id="689556"> If the federal government does not step in as it used to, tourism will suffer. That is what the organizers told me. They will also not be able to bring in as many artists. That is another aspect. Festivals are a question of pride. People show off their culture and discover others, depending on the themes of the show, and this leads to a broadening of minds at festivals. The Conservatives are holding things up here for reasons that are really beyond me. </ParaText><ParaText id="689557"> I just wanted to point all this out to our colleagues because I am sure that they will react quite quickly when they see that what they are saying does not make any sense, especially as the money for this was approved in the budget. It is very important, therefore, to point this out. </ParaText><ParaText id="689558"> There is a statistic showing that, in Quebec in the year 2000, festivals got 18% of their funding from the three levels of government: federal, provincial and municipal. That same year in the United States—our neighbour to the south where capitalism is a kind of religion—the three levels of government subsidized festivals to the tune of 23% to 26%. Maybe they thought it was important for them to add value. In France, festivals are subsidized at a rate of 47%. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689559"> Our Conservative colleagues should say to themselves that even though they are not providing very much, they really should make it available before the end of the summer or else we will be in an absolutely ridiculous situation. In view of this, I would like my Conservative colleagues to understand that they have to keep the commitments they made in their budget. </ParaText><ParaText id="689560"> In regard to a completely different issue, I would like to mention a very embarrassing situation. September 25 or 26, 2006 was a black day in human history because that was when the federal government cancelled the court challenges program. The Conservative government decided last March not to renew this program, even though a great many social stakeholders from both the English and French minority communities as well as citizens rights groups demanded that it be saved. This meant that $5 or $6 million could be cut from the federal budget. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689561"> I took some political science courses at the University of Ottawa in the 1980s, and one of my professors, Mr. Carrier, told us that $1 million in the coffers of the federal government of Canada was like a penny to an average worker in Canada or Quebec. When $5 or $6 million are cut from a rights program like the court challenges program, it is clearly not very much in view of the $220 billion budgets that Canada’s federal government generally has. So this is an ideological cut. The government wants to prevent something, rather than helping citizens challenge decisions made by the federal or a provincial government or even a school board, a town or municipality, or a department that was not complying with the law of the land, that is to say, the Constitution. </ParaText><ParaText id="689562"> The government comes with all its lawyers and sets them on a parent or business person who wants his or her rights respected. Without the court challenges program, there is no level playing field. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="40">(1940)</Timestamp><ParaText id="689563">People cannot spend the kind of money that the government, the federal State, can spend on its own army of lawyers. I could provide some pretty unbelievable examples of this.</ParaText><ParaText id="689564">That said, there is something even worse. We often hear our Conservative colleagues say that the Bloc Québécois did not support Bill <Document DbId="2154793" Type="3">S-3</Document>, which was in fact passed—on division, as they say—in the previous Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="689565">By eliminating the court challenges program, the Conservative government is failing to respect the Official Languages Act. I would refer the members to the Standing Committee on Official Languages, which just came back to life today. The Commissioner of Official Languages, Graham Fraser, taught a very interesting lesson to all members of the committee—and we are very pleased that the Conservatives have decided to come back—about how eliminating the court challenges program violated legislation passed in this House. That is pretty serious. Those who violate laws must pay in the end. They have violated this law, and they must pay the price.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689566">It is important to understand a few things about this program. The committee heard witnesses who work for the program. It also heard people who fought for the Montfort Hospital, for example. That happened in the mid-1990s. We were around then; this was not something that happened back in Louis Riel's day—which is another subject about which much could be said. This was back in 1995, when the Government of Ontario wanted to do away with the services of a French-language hospital right here in Ottawa. I was born in that province, and so was my youngest daughter, my baby. She was born in the Montfort Hospital.</ParaText><ParaText id="689567">The people who came to talk about this situation had been told by a Prime Minister whom we know well, our current Prime Minister, that the Government of Canada had no intention of continuing to pay for Liberal lawyers in the court challenges program.</ParaText><ParaText id="689568">Yet Ms. Lalonde and Mr. Gratton, who attended the committee meeting, demonstrated quite clearly that the lawyers who helped the Montfort Hospital fight the indignity foisted upon it by Mike Harris' government and three of his ministers, who are now known here as the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="105835" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="78772" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation>, did it for free.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689569">In response to the infamous criticism that partisan politics were involved, I would remind the House that Mr. Gratton was Brian Mulroney's press secretary. As far as I know, he did not belong to the Conservative Party, but rather to the Progressive Conservative Party. There are hints of this Reform-Alliance mindset still causing problems today. It is going to burst, sooner or later, like last time, but that is their problem. Gisèle Lalonde once ran—hold on to your hats—as a candidate for the Conservative Party of Ontario. This jambalaya—although jambalaya can sometimes be quite tasty—, all this mishmash being served up by the Conservatives, involving partisan politics when it comes to the rights of minorities, it is appalling. I see them turning red. They are ashamed, and I understand why.</ParaText><ParaText id="689570">That said, the elimination of the court challenges program, illustrated by the ideology reflected in the budget, seriously jeopardizes the recognition of the existence of French-language minority communities in Canada.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="45">(1945)</Timestamp><ParaText id="689571">That is prejudicial. The day the Montfort Hospital file reached its full scope was the day that the Premier of Quebec—Lucien Bouchard of the Parti Québécois, not to mention any names—declared that, indeed, it was seriously prejudicial. Every fighting force for democracy and the respect of the rights of minorities from Quebec and Ontario, including myself, who was in Saskatchewan at the time as president of the Fédération des francophones de Saskatoon, we all signed petitions and raised money to tell the Harris government that it was unacceptable.</ParaText><ParaText id="689572">Of course the Liberal government—this was during the Chrétien years—looked at the issue and said it could not intervene because it was a provincial jurisdiction. Well, now would be the time for Canada to pull up its socks and get to work, because, under such circumstances, it is through the court challenges program and political action that we must ensure the rights of minorities.</ParaText><ParaText id="689573">The court challenges program also has an impact on the social aspect of the fight against poverty and injustice. For example, people with disabilities had to fight their own government, demanding that it install ramps so they could have access to the same services as people with full mobility. We must not forget this.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689574">A broad range of services was provided to society. In 1997 and 2003, evaluations of the court challenges program determined that the needs of Quebec and Canadian society were well served by the program. Without it, we would not have rights of access to minority language education. The disabled would not be able to access certain areas and premises. It is very important to take note of these facts.</ParaText><ParaText id="689575">Today, the Fédération des communautés francophones et acadienne du Canada is taking the government to court because it abolished the court challenges program and is not fulfilling its obligations under the Official Languages Act. My colleagues should hang on to their hats when they hear what I have to say. This government says that it wanted to abolish the program because, among other things, it no longer wished to pay lawyers who challenge federal or provincial governments, school boards or others who do not respect these rights. That is why it abolished the program. Now it is paying lawyers to ensure that it does not pay lawyers in future. Talk about unbelievable. The logic is rather complicated.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689576">There is no question that the court challenges program must be reinstated. We must realize that society evolves. By way of illustration, consider that at one time horses ruled the road. Then along came the Model T Ford. Today, things are altogether different; we have other means of transportation. In terms of citizens' rights, we cannot predict how current situations will unfold in the near future. Therefore, it is important to have the court challenges program, precisely to protect the state from itself.</ParaText><ParaText id="689577">In the movie, <I>The Name of the Rose</I>, based on the novel by Umberto Eco, old Jorge, a professional criminal, believes only in sublime repetition. The Conservatives are the sublime copy of the Mulroney Conservatives. They are doing the same thing—abolishing the court challenges program in today's context. It is quite deplorable.</ParaText><ParaText id="689578">We should be emulating William of Baskerville. I recommend reading about the dialectic that belongs to society. In fact, we are evolving. I am thinking of Yann Martel who sends books to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> from time to time. He should send more there because reading is interesting.

This is a debate about the estimates.</ParaText><ParaText id="689590">I would say that in my 10 years in Parliament one of the things that I have come to realize is that intent matters with the government. My hon. Bloc colleague did talk about the meanspirited way in which the government has dealt with many things. He referred to some of the vestiges of the Harris Ontario government, the triumvirate, the ministers of health, finance and environment, that we actually see very much in evidence in this Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="689591"> I recognize that while there are many things that make the Bloc unique in some of its approaches, I find that its social approaches to many of the solutions in Parliament are actually quite aligned with the Liberal Party.</ParaText><ParaText id="689592">I want to refer to something very specific in my riding. The Kitchener-Waterloo Multicultural Centre in my riding has actually put forward a stunning presentation. It is a very integral part of my riding which is the fourth largest settlement area for new Canadians in Canada, despite the fact that as a region we are only half a million people.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689593">There was a proposal for ethnocultural racial minorities to participate in public decision making. The centre had been through many levels of scrutiny and I think had actually been agreed to by three different levels of government which said this was something worthwhile doing.</ParaText><ParaText id="689594">Three program officers and departmental approval was gained. Yet, at the very final hour, as a matter of fact today, it found out that this wonderful project was not going to receive funding. </ParaText><ParaText id="689595">A similar thing happened with the K-W counselling services in my riding as well.

Has he experienced the fact that to the government their intent matters. The government believes in the trickle down theory, that there is only a certain sector of Canada that it is speaking to, and it happens to be its electorate. If people do not fall into that minority then they are not covered by the priorities of the government. Would my colleague like to comment on that?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The federal government has decided to go with a new way of doing things. The former program worked well. It seems that, when things are working well, our Conservative colleagues have a knack for dismantling them.</ParaText><ParaText id="689599">Our multi-ethnic organizations are probably smaller than those in my colleague's riding. Nevertheless, we do have an Arab community and a Portuguese community. I am thinking of self-help and anti-poverty organizations, which provided young people with summer jobs in youth job cooperatives or summer camps that were axed because of a set of criteria developed by the government that did not make sense.</ParaText><ParaText id="689600">Fortunately, the Bloc Québécois, the New Democratic Party, the Liberal Party of Canada and community groups—those affected first and the fabric of our society—challenged the government. I have to acknowledge the Conservatives for recognizing that they made mistakes. However, that is as far as I will go because they have not recognized all their mistakes. They should have kept what was working well.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689601">I will therefore say to my hon. colleague that my riding has experienced certain difficulties in that regard. An element of unfairness is introduced when using a points-based assessment, and when riding officials no longer have a say and everything is sent to Montreal—which is a lovely city but where the people are not familiar with the social fabric and events in the Gatineau riding—rather than relying on the work of government employees who are very familiar with the riding. I empathize with the multicultural communities, which unfortunately—and I did use the term unfortunately—have had to pay the price for this lack of judgment. But there is always hope. One never knows. Perhaps our colleagues will come to their senses in this matter?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

These estimates before us give a road map of where the government intends to take this country. Normally one would expect to see within all of these numbers a vision, a plan for building a country, a plan for building a country with a vision of prosperity, equality and justice for all people. </ParaText><ParaText id="689603">That, after all, is the objective of government, is it not? We are here as an institution that stands for upholding the rights of people and ensuring that government works for all the people all of the time. When we see a budget or a set of spending estimates that helps only a tiny portion of the people in this land, we have to stand on behalf of those Canadians and make sure they are counted. </ParaText><ParaText id="689604">Tonight, many, many thousands of people across this nation are not counted. They are not part of these spending estimates, because the government has decided that its aim and objective is to enhance the lives of those who are already well off, those who are already living in the lap of luxury, and to ignore the vast majority of Canadians who struggle each and every day to make a living to sustain themselves and their families.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689605">Tonight I want to speak for my kids, Mr. Speaker, who I hope are watching tonight. I know you would probably say, “I really wonder about that”, but I am hoping that my son Joe, who is 18, and my son Nick, who is 22, are watching tonight because they know the importance of this place and they know why I am here and what I am trying to do.</ParaText><ParaText id="689606"> Today, Mr. Speaker, like you and others in my caucus, I am trying to stand up for those young people who have so much to give to this country and need to be afforded every opportunity. They do not come with their hands out; they come with the ambition, the vision and the dreams of building a better world. </ParaText><ParaText id="689607">In the case of my older son Nick, who is 22, he happens to have a disability, but he lives in a group home. Thanks to the government of Manitoba, which has its spending priorities right, he is able to live with dignity and make a difference and contribute to our society. He is not looking for a handout. He is looking to be recognized for his talents and to put them to the use that God has given him.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689608"> In fact, he is able to make a difference in the lives of people around him. It is not a wasted dollar. It is a dollar well spent, because for every dollar we invest in children and people with disabilities we get many dollars back. Statistics show that for every dollar we invest in a child with a disability we get $7 back.</ParaText><ParaText id="689609"> Let us start thinking about proper economics in this case and try to get this government onto a sound fiscal footing, which it has not been on up to this point. </ParaText><ParaText id="689610">Let me give members some lessons from other provinces like Manitoba, which has had an NDP government for three consecutive terms, making history in this country. Let me speak about the unending number of budgets under the Tommy Douglas government in Saskatchewan that have given this nation an example of and a model for what fiscal prudence and fiscal planning are all about. It means ensuring that everyone, the least among us, is able to afford the greatest niceties in life, to enjoy as much as those with money and wealth in their pockets.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689611">It is about ensuring that everyone among us is able to live under his or her own fig tree, as Tommy Douglas always used to say, without fear, without worry and without trepidation, regardless of their circumstances, their abilities, their colour of skin, their sex or their gender or their geography. Here tonight we aim to try to focus the government on that principle about a balanced approach to government to ensure that everyone among us able to achieve his or her fullest potential. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="05">(2005)</Timestamp><ParaText id="689612">I also speak tonight for some young kids from the Point Douglas area in my constituency, who have just had the great honour of meeting our Governor General. Point Douglas is among the poorest neighbourhoods in the country. It is a place where people struggle day to day and strive to make a difference despite great odds.</ParaText><ParaText id="689613"> The Governor General visited this area and said the following:</ParaText><ParaText id="689614"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Yet despite all the sadness, the fear, and the trepidation, I also met a community that had decided once and for all to break the silence and transform their community into a space where security, solidarity and compassion would prevail.</QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText><ParaText id="689615">That is what this community is like. That is what so many communities across this country are like. They want to be a place of security where there is great quality of life. They expect government to work with them as partners to build those communities of safety, security, decency and civility.</ParaText><ParaText id="689616">That is why this budget is so important. That is why these estimates have to be dissected and debated. The government has its plans and priorities all wrong. It has followed for too long the past governments of this land that have whittled away our huge surpluses and have taken available money and put it against one cause only, and that was the debt, regardless of what difference that made in the lives of this nation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689617">The estimates tonight are about looking for fiscal wisdom, for balanced fiscal planning, for prudence, and for ensuring that we live up to all of our responsibilities as government. Yet the Conservative government, like the previous ones over the last 10 or 20 years, has chosen instead to invest in those areas that have the least amount of spinoff and benefit for the rest of the country but which enhance the wealth, the status and the power of a very few in our society today.</ParaText><ParaText id="689618">If there is anything a budget should do, anything these spending estimates should do, it should be to narrow the gap between the rich and the poor. It should be to narrow the gap between the most wealthy and the rest of Canadians. It should be to support and help ordinary families, working people like those in Transcona, Winnipeg North, Sherbrooke or Regina. People work hard in this country and they do not want a handout, as I said, but they do want the support of government to make a difference.</ParaText><ParaText id="689619">This budget does not do one thing to close the prosperity gap. In fact, it makes the problem worse rather than better. Let us look at the spending priorities of the government. Let us look at the fiscal management of the Conservatives. Let me look at the wisdom of a few things.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689620">For example, the Conservatives decided to give a tax break to Canadians and reduced the GST by 1%, which cost about $5 billion. Their own records show, by a freedom of information request exercised by a member of the media, that in fact this $5 billion has not made any difference in the lives of ordinary Canadians. </ParaText><ParaText id="689621">It has not made life easier. It has not made it possible to buy essential goods. It has not brought down the price of gas. That $5 billion has not made housing more affordable. The government has not done anything except scatter $5 billion across this land without any impact and without any significant or lasting end product. </ParaText><ParaText id="689622">Let us imagine what we could do with that $5 billion. Let us imagine that we were going to live up to the Atlantic accord and we put $1 billion there. Let us make sure that we at least keep our word, we would say, and then we would work on a formula that made sense. </ParaText><ParaText id="689623">What if we took $1 billion of that and, instead of giving zero to our first nations communities, actually gave them $1 billion to help them deal with decrepit housing conditions, third world housing conditions that are an embarrassment around the world? Canada has a blemished reputation around the world because of that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689624">What if we took $1 billion and actually saved the child care program? What if we actually took that $1 billion and provided families with the certainty that their kids were in a safe place when they went off to work to make a living to support themselves and their families?</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="10">(2010)</Timestamp><ParaText id="689625">What if we in fact saw that this money invested in day care multiplied? What if we recognized that this is not just about giving money to families? The Conservatives probably would think it is going to women who should be at home or to families who really do not need it, but in fact it is going to the ordinary families who are trying to work for a living and need care for their children. </ParaText><ParaText id="689626">What if we looked beyond just that issue about supporting families and looked at the economic dividends? What if we look at it as this article did in the <I>Winnipeg Free Press</I> of May 12, in an article by Laura Rance? A researcher showed, says Rance, the following:</ParaText><ParaText id="689627"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Her research found that 12 licensed child care nurseries providing services for just under 400 households in the Parkland region north of Riding Mountain National Park were worth $1.73 million to the economy of six rural municipalities and five towns and villages. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="689628"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">As that money rippled through the economy, it produced $2.74 million in additional direct and indirect benefits. It employed 76 people full- and part-time in addition to creating an additional 28 jobs. Meanwhile, parents using the child care services generated $12.4 million in income.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="689629">The findings were similar in many other places, the research showed.</ParaText><ParaText id="689630">That is what we mean. We are not talking about frittering away money. We are talking about investing money in areas that produce multiple effects and achieve different objectives.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689631"> In this case, we help those families support themselves. We make sure they are not under stress and their kids are not uncared for in poor and unsafe situations. Good enough, because we know the savings from that would be enormous. If we can keep families from becoming dysfunctional, if we can keep kids from falling between the cracks, we will save millions and billions of dollars down the road. What if we understood, though, that every dollar we invest in child care produced another dollar in the economy, just as the writer in the <I>Winnipeg Free Press</I> said?</ParaText><ParaText id="689632">The member for <Affiliation DbId="78580" Type="2">Selkirk—Interlake</Affiliation> should take note of this. He should know that in fact his government has quashed all hopes for rural day care. He should know what a difference it would make to his community and to rural communities everywhere if families had the day care they needed, if workers had the jobs they wanted, and if the communities had the economic spinoffs they needed. That is just one example to think about.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689633">Let us think about the government and its $9.2 billion in unanticipated surplus, which is because of lowballing. That is because the Conservatives are doing what the Liberals did for all those years. They refuse to give us proper economic forecasts. Therefore, if they end up being in the position of having to spend that money on needs of Canadians, they can say, “Well, we did not know and therefore we have to put it all against the debt”. Hogwash. They knew darn well that there was extra money. They knew darn well that it was not $9.2 billion when we got these estimates. It is now at $9.7 billion or $10 billion, all of it gone against the debt. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689634">We do not disagree with some money going against the debt. We know that is important. As homeowners, we know that we have to try to pay off our mortgage as well as look after our family's needs, but we do not put all of our money against the house if our kids need to go to university and we need some of that money, or if the roof is leaking. As I have said so many times in this House, we do not just put it all in one place if there are many needs. We try to ensure that the needs of our family are met, just as a responsible government would try to ensure that the needs of all communities in this country are met.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689635">Let us imagine if we had taken, say, $3 billion off that $10 billion and put it against the debt, which is reasonable. That would bring our debt to GDP ratio down to below that of most industrialized countries. Let us imagine, then, that we still had $6 billion or $7 billion left to help build this country. We could invest in infrastructure, where we have a $60 billion deficit that is getting bigger every day because the bad roads are getting worse, the weak bridges are caving in, and the sewers are getting holes. Who knows? Things go from bad to worse if we do not invest. Obviously I am not a city maintenance person or an engineer, but I do know bad roads when I see them, and I know they get worse over time if we do not repair them.</ParaText><ParaText id="689636">What if we invested some of that money in our declining infrastructure, which would then build up the attractiveness of cities, make people enjoy their communities more, and let people get to work and home more quickly?</ParaText><ParaText id="689637"> What if we put some of that money into environmental projects which actually would help ensure that we save this planet? What if we took some of that money from those billions and put just a bit of it into saving the oceans?</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="15">(2015)</Timestamp><ParaText id="689638">We just had the David Suzuki Foundation at our committee saying the oceans are just about dead. It asked for some money to protect some marine projects. What did it get from the government? It got $9 million. As I said at committee, never mind a drop in the bucket, it is a teardrop in the ocean.</ParaText><ParaText id="689639"> It makes us want to cry when we see the poor judgment of the government and what it is doing to future generations. It is our environment that is at risk. It is the lives of our kids that are at risk. It is the industries and the economic sectors in this country that are at risk because we are not investing in them.</ParaText><ParaText id="689640">When it comes to the prosperity gap, we are at an all time high in terms of the width of that gap. In fact, the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives has said that we are in a situation now that we have not seen in 30 years. We are seeing those at the top end of the income scale making more in one week than a vast majority of Canadians can hope to earn in a year.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689641">When we look at some of the executive benefits for CEO bank heads and we look at the packages they get, like the $6 million that the head of CIBC takes home, and compare that to the fact that this is a bank that would not even pay the $30,000 that is owed to the bank tellers. It would not even pay for the overtime worked by bank tellers. That is symptomatic of this society and this government. </ParaText><ParaText id="689642">We have policies now that widen the gap. Instead of dealing with the problems left by the Liberals, the Conservatives are making them worse. </ParaText><ParaText id="689643">For example, here are the biggest concerns that I have had with the Liberal government. It failed to keep its child care promise until 13 years after the first day that it made it. All those kids in those 13 years ended up in difficult situations and their families had to struggle even more.</ParaText><ParaText id="689644"> It killed the national housing program, so that we are the only nation in the industrialized world that does not have a national housing policy. </ParaText><ParaText id="689645">It refused to address the deplorable living and housing conditions of our first nations on reserves and our aboriginal people everywhere. </ParaText><ParaText id="689646">It refused in fact to advance seriously on environmental projects and urban transit.</ParaText><ParaText id="689647"> One more thing that really grates me, and I am sure others, is that it cut the core funding out of women's groups.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689648">Today, the Liberals have the gall to stand up and complain about what the Conservatives did to take more money away so that more offices closed and more people are living with poor housing. Goodness gracious, they caused the problem in the first place, so at least stand up and admit it. At least stand up and say, “We made a mistake and we do not want the Conservatives to do the same thing”, because that was the very beginning of deep erosion in this country.</ParaText><ParaText id="689649">I have seen it in my own constituency. Ten years ago the housing started to deteriorate, exactly at the same time that the Liberals cut away any programs that people could draw on to restore housing, to renew housing, to build new housing, to develop social housing, and to explore and expand co-op housing. </ParaText><ParaText id="689650">It all came to a dead halt. Except for the bits that the province had been able to pull together, except for the money that the NDP managed to get out of that Liberal minority government, and except for some generous charitable organizations like Habitat for Humanity, we would be nowhere.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689651">As it is, we can put a few band-aids on the situation, but that is not going to hold us in good stead for very long. We need the federal government working in partnership with us, with communities like Winnipeg North, with Just Housing, with North End Community Renewal Corporation, with North End Women's Resource Centre, with Nadinawe, and all of the other organizations that are so determined to make a difference.</ParaText><ParaText id="689652">These are groups and organizations that see the value of helping others to help themselves. They only expect that much of government. I ask members today, is that too much for us to expect of our government?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The questions had to do with the text panels filled with errors in French at Vimy, the appointment of a unilingual English ombudsman for victims of crime, and the elimination of compulsory bilingualism for the senior ranks of the army. On those issues, we wanted to know what the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> or the minister had to say to the Commissioner of Official Languages regarding the way the Conservative government is trampling the rights of linguistic minorities. The situation is not getting any better in that regard, especially considering the court challenges program.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689750">Today in the Standing Committee on Official Languages we had the pleasure of receiving the Commissioner of Official Languages. He told us that the Conservative government is absolutely not obeying former Bill <Document DbId="1426991" Type="4">S-3</Document>, which was passed during the last Parliament and implemented things and gave more teeth to the Official Languages Act, to section 7 among other things. Eliminating the court challenges program is another breach of the act.</ParaText><ParaText id="689751">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> tells us that he wants to eliminate this program because his government will respect the Canadian Constitution and we will therefore no longer need the court challenges program. The Commissioner of Official Languages made it quite clear that we do indeed need this type of program. Furthermore, Mr. Matte, the chair of the court challenges program, and Gisèle Lalonde, who advocated for the Montfort Hospital thanks to this program, illustrated the need for this program.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689752">The federal government cannot force a province, a school board or any agency in society that does not recognize or respect the Canadian Constitution. In Canada, some citizens have to pressure the government through the court in order to have their rights respected and the government shows up with a whole host of lawyers. These agencies do not have the money they need to deal with the expertise before them. The court challenges program is so very necessary.</ParaText><ParaText id="689753">In light of this situation, I want to know what my Conservative colleagues have to say to the Commissioner of Official Languages about their non-respect for the application of the Official Languages Act, with respect to the examples I have just given. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We have signed agreements with the provinces and territories on services and education to the tune of $1.18 billion over four years. Dozens of other funding agreements with groups and community organizations have also been concluded, as well as cooperation agreements with the provinces and territories on minority language services to the tune of $64 million over four years. </ParaText><ParaText id="689756">The <Affiliation DbId="78775" Type="4">Minister for la Francophonie and Official Languages</Affiliation> announced support for the construction and expansion of school-community centres in New Brunswick, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories. By providing better programs and services in French-language day cares, schools and universities, where francophones are in the minority, our goal is to allow young Canadians to start, continue and complete their studies in their language.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689757">In addition, the Government of Canada is allocating $80 million per year to second language education programs to support official language education for 2.4 million young Canadians. Our government recognizes that official language minority communities face huge challenges, and we want to support them in a very real way through investments designed to help them develop and thrive. </ParaText><ParaText id="689758">In October, the <Affiliation DbId="78775" Type="4">Minister for la Francophonie and Official Languages</Affiliation> co-chaired the Ministerial Conference on the Canadian Francophonie. There is a great spirit of cooperation among various levels of government, a spirit of cooperation that has enabled us to support minority rights. In that respect, I am delighted that Quebec has once again become a full partner in our efforts to support la Francophonie. Quebec is the cradle of Canadian Francophonie, and the support of our partners in Quebec is vital to the development of French throughout Canada. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="689759">Cooperation with our partners has had a number of positive results, including: an education agreement with Ontario worth over $300 million for 2005-06 to 2008-09 to support minority language education and second language learning; a special agreement with New Brunswick to establish two school and community centres; funds to set up a New Brunswick institute to support the development of second language education across Canada; and financial support for various festivals and cultural events, such as the Franco-Ontarian Festival, <I>L'écho d'un peuple</I> in Ontario, Quebec 2008 and the États généraux des arts et de la culture in Caraquet.</ParaText><ParaText id="689760">Furthermore, with respect to immigration, the government has developed a plan to encourage francophone immigrants to settle in minority language communities. This is crucial to the future and the vitality of official language minority communities. With this summary—</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The court challenges program was eliminated. This violates the Official Languages Act. It was done in a cavalier manner. The <Affiliation DbId="78766" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Heritage and Status of Women</Affiliation> simply announced to the people who work in the court challenges program that the program had been cut and would come to an end. The evaluations of the program conducted in 1997 and 2003 were not even taken into account. The cut was based on ideology.</ParaText><ParaText id="689764">This file is damaging to French-language minority communities, just as it is damaging to anyone who believes the Constitution should protect the rights of vulnerable people in our society. Furthermore, the Commissioner of Official Languages and other key players in Quebec and Canadian society have demonstrated that this program has helped to strengthen the fight against assimilation. It is a very important tool for those communities.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We are making new investments to ensure the development of both official languages throughout the country. In April, we announced that five minority communities would participate in a pilot project to analysed the effects of French-language enriched services on linguistic, cultural and overall development of pre-school children. Our government has made a commitment of $10.8 million over five years for this pilot project.<ForceColumnBreak/></ParaText><ParaText id="689766">In budget 2007, the government increased funding for official language minority communities by an additional $30 million over two years. These monies will finance cultural and extra-curricular activities, community centres as well as activities that will help enhance the benefits related to linguistic duality for children. This is in addition to the $751.3 million over five years provided by the action plan for official languages.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
