					<ParaText id="996304">The House resumed from February 4 consideration of the motion.</ParaText><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Petit" id="2381685"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78391" Type="2">Mr. Daniel Petit (Charlesbourg—Haute-Saint-Charles, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="996305">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in the debate on Motion M-414, which proposes measures to address the challenges facing Canada's forestry sector.</ParaText><ParaText id="996306">I would like to preface my comments by saying that I do not wish to downplay the challenges facing the forestry sector. Members on both sides of the House and from all regions of the country understand that these are serious, major challenges, but in many cases, they are a lot like the challenges affecting other sectors of the economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="996307">Forestry companies and related industries are not the only ones having problems. The slowdown in the American economy resulting from the sub-prime mortgage crisis south of the border is now having a negative impact on a number of sectors here that export goods and services to the American market.</ParaText><ParaText id="996308">Also, the loonie's recent rise to dizzying heights compared to the American dollar is having an impact on many sectors of the economy where costs are calculated in Canadian dollars and revenue in U.S. dollars.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996309">Competition is also a factor in other sectors too. Many sectors are beginning to deal with increased competition from low-cost producers, as well as conventional producers seeking to increase their market share.</ParaText><ParaText id="996310">The combination of a strong Canadian dollar, a weak American economy and increasing foreign competition is having a tremendous impact on the bottom line for many Canadian companies, particularly in the manufacturing sector.</ParaText><ParaText id="996311">The forestry and manufacturing sectors both need access to appropriate basic economic tools so that our companies can turn their attention and their efforts to facing these challenges. Clearly, Canadian manufacturers are determined to remain competitive within a global economy. International competition is a catalyst for innovation.</ParaText><ParaText id="996312">Competitiveness opens up new opportunities, and the reality of today's world market has made it easier than ever to coordinate activities along the supply chain. Cheap telecommunications and fast, easy transportation have made global networks a reality, and international trade, product research, innovation and development, financing and other services are being set up where it makes the most business sense.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996313">When economic fundamentals are solid, businesses have a better chance of making their mark and succeeding. Canada's economic fundamentals are solid.</ParaText><ParaText id="996314">While other economies are facing uncertainty, Canada is the only G-7 country with budget surpluses and a falling debt burden. Our unemployment rate is the lowest it has been in 33 years. In 2007, employment in Canada rose by approximately 360,000 jobs, all of them good, high-paying jobs.</ParaText><ParaText id="996315">This government wants to make sure that Canadians are benefiting from our economic success, and this certainly includes the manufacturing and forestry sectors. </ParaText><ParaText id="996316">We want them to make investments that will help them compete in the long term. We want them to benefit from a well-informed workforce. And so, the government has announced a plan to build a strong economy by creating the conditions that will allow Canadians and Canadian businesses to prosper.</ParaText><ParaText id="996317">Advantage Canada has established a strategic, long-term economic plan to improve Canada's economic prosperity, both today and in the future—prosperity that will benefit manufacturers. The plan creates five key advantages that will help our country to remain internationally competitive while ensuring that we live in a stronger, safer and better Canada.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996318">The tax advantage will establish the lowest tax rate on new business investment in the G-7. The fiscal advantage will eliminate Canada's total government net debt in less than a generation. The entrepreneurial advantage will reduce unnecessary regulation and red tape. The knowledge advantage will create the best educated, most skilled and most flexible workforce in the world.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996319">And the infrastructure advantage will help move people, goods and services across our country and our borders.</ParaText><ParaText id="996320">We then followed up on these concrete measures. We introduced a substantial tax break for manufacturers on the capital cost allowance for eligible machinery and equipment, which means a $1.3 billion boost to the manufacturing industry. Our manufacturers can now invest to increase productivity, so that they can remain competitive, regardless of the value of the Canadian dollar.</ParaText><ParaText id="996321">In the 2008 budget, we extended the provisions of the accelerated capital cost allowance program from two years to five. This will mean $1 billion in assistance for manufacturers, and is just one of many measures introduced since our government was elected in 2006. These measures include eliminating the capital tax and the corporate surtax and reducing corporate and small business tax rates. Overall, these measures represent $9 billion in tax relief for manufacturers and producers in Canada.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996322">We are eliminating administrative formalities and reducing red tape. We are supporting marketing and R and D. We are making the largest infrastructure investment in the past 50 years. Like other sectors, the forestry industry will certainly benefit from these measures. And the forestry industry has benefited from one of the first measures the government took after being elected just two years ago: the successful negotiation of the softwood lumber agreement between Canada and the United States. </ParaText><ParaText id="996323">We must not underestimate the importance of this achievement. For Canada, resolving this dispute was the best way to improve basic economic conditions in the forestry industry. This action by our government put an end to years of expensive litigation that produced no tangible results and only prolonged the uncertainty for the market and for Canadian producers.</ParaText><ParaText id="996324">This measure gave stable access to the United States, the largest economy in the world, our closest neighbour and our largest market and trading partner. It also put $5 billion back into the hands of Canadian softwood lumber producers. That was a huge injection of capital for producers who, in many cases, likely doubted they would ever see that money again.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996325">Earlier, I mentioned the low unemployment rates and how employment in Canada had grown by 360,000 jobs in the past year alone. On our side of the House, we understand that this overall growth is not divided equally among all communities across the country. We know that some manufacturing jobs are threatened and that this is an important issue in the forestry industry as well. We know that we cannot be complacent, especially if we want to be competitive in the global economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="996326">Like much of the manufacturing industry, the forestry industry must restructure and adapt to the new economic realities that are affecting many single-industry communities. Consequently, on January 10, 2008, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> announced a $1 billion national community development trust to help vulnerable communities that are dependent on a single employer or industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="996327">We expect the provinces and territories to use this funding for a wide range of initiatives ranging from job training and development to community transition plans and infrastructure initiatives to promote local economic diversification.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996328">It is not the government's policy to choose winners—nor should any government have such a policy. Our role is simple. Our role is to lay the economic foundations necessary to ensure that the economy can function properly. This can be difficult to achieve, however. If we are successful, businesses will be in a better position to develop and prosper.</ParaText><ParaText id="996329">This government wanted to provide businesses and manufacturers with the conditions that would allow them to compete with the rest of the world and this is working. Manufacturers are adapting and innovating. They are confident and the government will be here to back them up. We will continue to work with them by creating a climate in which businesses can succeed and there will be jobs for Canadians.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Boshcoff" id="2381695"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78979" Type="2">Mr. Ken Boshcoff (Thunder Bay—Rainy River, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="996330">Mr. Speaker, this debate comes at a very interesting time, because as our Standing Committee on Natural Resources conducts its hearings, we have been hearing officially and with a great deal of reference and confirmation that many of the issues raised since the forestry competitiveness plan of November 2005 have resurfaced. In fact, they have boiled over into problems that no one really expected would become so aggravated and problematic.</ParaText><ParaText id="996331">When the standing committee decided to hold these hearings, it was not without a measure of coincidence that a so-called $1 billion plan, a competitive trust, was announced for the forest industry. It sounded like it would be quite salvageable and would do something for the industry. Then we found out, first of all, that the plan was supposed to come out in July. Thanks to pressure from the standing committee, that money became available, and I think that today is the first day it should be flowing to the provinces and territories. </ParaText><ParaText id="996332">But then, upon closer examination, we found out that, first, the $1 billion will be spread over three years, so it is not $1 billion a year. Second, it is not just for the forest industry. It is for any industry that the provinces and territories choose. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996333">As well, the formula of distribution means that provinces which may not need it as much as Ontario does will find themselves with a plan that has no federal component whatsoever, with the money simply being transferred to the provinces and territories. The provinces and territories may like that, but for us federally, it represents a lost opportunity for us to be able to spend that money to ensure that the forestry industry would be stabilized and workers, who may not have to lose their jobs, could still be working.</ParaText><ParaText id="996334">Indeed, if the $1.5 billion plan that had been proposed under the government of member for <Affiliation DbId="78571" Type="2">LaSalle—Émard</Affiliation> had been adopted in November or December of 2005, thousands of jobs would have been saved and many plants, mills and operations would still be in business.</ParaText><ParaText id="996335">When we look at the lack of conditions in regard to this so-called $1 billion, we realize that the provinces and territories can do whatever they want, so there are no terms and conditions. Indeed, the Standing Committee on Natural Resources was quite shocked when the deputy minister for natural resources appeared before us and we found out that there was no knowledge of the mechanics of the distribution of this money. There was only the general outline.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996336">So clearly we have exposed another scam. That is a problem for the forest industry. It means that the work done by organizations across the country in their recommendations in terms of addressing transportation issues with railways and the competitive cost advantages such as capital cost allowances, which they say should be longer, is being ignored. The <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> ignores that. We will discover throughout our hearings the kind of evidence that will make this pragmatic and hopefully acceptable in order for the government to come to its senses on this.</ParaText><ParaText id="996337">We know there has been a two year gap. In fact, often the money for the pine beetle is trotted out as something that is being done. Of course, we have found out that not one beetle has been stopped and not one tree has been saved by all this money. We have to wonder what kind of pork-barrelling is going on with that kind of money instead of hard research that would lead to scientific results and some solutions.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp><ParaText id="996338">We also found, to a disturbing amount, that no communities, no aboriginal communities, no municipalities were consulted at all with regard to this so-called billion dollar fund, nor were the provinces in terms of their own departments of natural resources or those departments of industry which are charged with helping the forest industry. Therefore, it is quite remarkable that such a thing could go on.</ParaText><ParaText id="996339">In hearing from the mayors of towns such as Kenora, Thunder Bay and Dryden, they have let us know exactly how hard the impacts of these were and the fact that not one item of information has been received by any municipality individually, regionally or provincially such as the Association of Municipalities of Ontario or the Federation of Canadian Municipalities in terms of the distribution of this. </ParaText><ParaText id="996340">Even far more shocking, believe it or not, not one member of any labour organization from coast to coast to coast was asked how their membership could apply or could benefit from any of this funding. It is startling that something could be dreamt up in the Prime Minister's Office and no one else knew about it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996341">Now it is out there and it is being written as we speak. Therefore, in distributing a trust fund to a province or a territory it means that anything that we could have had in terms of a positive impact to make sense of this money, to distribute it to communities that have been hard hit and needing it, has been lost. That in itself is very disturbing.</ParaText><ParaText id="996342">We even find that many of the issues that the federal government could have used with this funding in terms of a federal stake, if we were going to allocate those kinds of dollars, and we know for certain that companies have been asking for various things in terms of retooling, environmental questions that had been proposed and the solutions in place in November 2005, are conspicuously absent. </ParaText><ParaText id="996343">Indeed, organizations such as the Forest Products Association of Canada, which has been working with the minister's office and with various sections, sees the research and the determination that it has had. I am not saying it has been ignored, but basically it is an organization that is proposing solutions. </ParaText><ParaText id="996344">It has now become incumbent upon the Standing Committee on Natural Resources to address these questions and bring them forward to Parliament in a report, but there is not anything that has not been said by various organizations, whether it is transportation, labour, forest communities, single industry towns, or forest associations that we have not known in terms of a solution. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996345">Many of those were included in the forest competitive plan of Prime Minister Martin. We know that in pushing for those types of things in a very calm and logical way, and identifying solutions as opposed to trying to blame someone else, that we really had a handle on it.</ParaText><ParaText id="996346">It would have eliminated an enormous amount of grief not only for our communities but suppliers, labour people themselves, the families involved and regions such as mine and the region of the hon. member from <Affiliation DbId="78989" Type="2">Kenora</Affiliation> where there is a regional level impact of a territory larger than the country of Germany or France. The impact has been phenomenal. </ParaText><ParaText id="996347">In conclusion, in supporting this motion before us, I believe in the strongest terms that we have been trying to get forestry as a front burner agenda. I give credit to the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78989" Type="2">Kenora</Affiliation> for forming a forestry caucus and taking leadership in the past number of years. </ParaText><ParaText id="996348">Indeed, it is within the Liberal Party of Canada that many of these solutions have come forward. I am glad to see them being adopted. Members can look forward in the next few weeks to a report that should propose federal solutions, federal involvement, and a federal front of mind for the forestry industry in Canada.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Godin" id="2381699"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78825" Type="2">Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="996349">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Motion M-414, presented by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78419" Type="2">Montmorency—Charlevoix—Haute-Côte-Nord</Affiliation>, to address the crisis in the manufacturing and forestry sectors. I have a hard time understanding how the government member could have said earlier that Canadian industry was doing well. He definitely did not visit the right regions, or else he is turning a blind eye to what is really going on.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996350">We need only take a look at the situation in northeastern New Brunswick, for example. The UPM plant in Miramichi closed its doors resulting in the loss of 600 jobs. The Weyerhaeuser mill, also in Miramichi, closed putting 140 people out of work. And again in Miramichi, 400 people working at the kraft paper mill lost their jobs. In 2005-06, 100 workers at the Nelson plant in Miramichi lost their jobs. In 2005, 270 workers at the Smurfit-Stone plant in Bathurst were laid off. Furthermore, AbitibiBowater, a company established in the 1930's, has just closed its doors putting about 360 people out of work. As for New Richmond,I am not sure how many jobs were lost, but I believe it was at least 300 to 350.</ParaText><ParaText id="996351">We could also look at the situation in northern Ontario. I have brothers who left Quebec 45 years ago to work in northern Ontario. They worked all their lives for Domtar and Abitibi Paper and they would never have believed that these plants would close their doors as they did last year.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996352">A whole industry is shutting down and the government says that it is doing just fine. Yes, it is doing fine: service jobs that pay minimum wage are being created. It is not that these types of jobs are not needed. However, these regions are hurting from the loss of jobs such as those at the Smurfit-Stone, AbitibiBowater and UPM plants. We have to ask why this happened. How did we lose these jobs? We are told that the American dollar has something to do with it. If the American dollar is a factor in these plant closures, then why are the companies saying that they are closing them forever and that they will only sell to companies that are not their competitors?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996353">The truth is that with NAFTA and free trade, foreign companies have stepped in and been allowed to buy our Canadian companies. These foreign companies end up deciding that their production is big enough and that they no longer need the plants in Canada. Once these companies have secured the market they close the plants. That is what is happening.</ParaText><ParaText id="996354">Smurfit-Stone bought the companies in Bathurst and New Richmond, but after a number of years it told the workers they were no longer needed. It said goodbye and left. After acquiring the markets, it closed the plants to eliminate the competition.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996355">The government invested money at the time, but there should have been agreements to ensure that these foreign countries could not close the plants in the heartless way they did. From one day to the next, they decided to close the doors, say goodbye and leave.</ParaText><ParaText id="996356">The Finnish company, UPM, kept sending wood to Finland, when people at home had lost their jobs. That is what happened. The same thing has happened to the paper plants throughout northern Ontario. Companies come here thinking that they can do what they want under free trade. They take our forest supply, have secondary and tertiary processing done abroad, send the wood to the United States and have absolutely no regard for jobs in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="996357">The government has turned a deaf ear to all this.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp><ParaText id="996358">Now it is bragging about investing $1 billion for the forestry industry, in order to try to fix this disaster. Even that money did not come easily, because the government wanted it to be included in the budget. That was blackmail. The government wanted the money to be dependent on the passage of the budget. If it had not passed, there would have been no money.</ParaText><ParaText id="996359">Last fall, when the government wanted to give a tax cut to large corporations, it did not say it would wait to see whether or not the budget was passed. The majority government, with the Liberals, made a mini-budget. They did this with the help of the Liberals. We do not have a minority government now; we have a majority Conservative and Liberal government. No one ever thought they would live to see such a coalition in Canada. The Liberals always said that they were the official opposition and that they would never vote with the government. Now, that is what they do. They remain seated, they do not vote; they leave, they do not vote. I think they should get a pay cut when they do not bother to vote. The unions call this a walkout. If an employee leaves their job, they are not paid. The Liberals are leaving the House, they are not voting, they are not working, but they still get paid for their work day. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996360">The forestry crisis did not start yesterday. Rather, it started under the Liberals, who stalled, stalled and stalled some more. This continued with the Conservatives, who now boast about receiving $5 billion, which is what the member said earlier. In fact, the American government owed us $5 billion dollars, and a $4 billion agreement was signed. The industry was robbed of $1 billion. Even worse than the theft of $1 billion, softwood lumber plants could not operate for five or more years. This left our companies in a very weak position. Today people have lost their jobs. This is nothing to boast about.</ParaText><ParaText id="996361">Industries, such as the forestry industry, began in 1930. Industries that are almost 100 years old are closing their doors. This hurts communities, towns and cities. This hurts an entire community. These industries were the heart of the economy in northwestern New Brunswick, for part of the Gaspésie and northern Ontario. There is also a large concentration of forestry work in British Columbia. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996362">What are they going to do with a billion dollars? That sure sounds like a lot of money. The government has invested a billion dollars. It was forced to do so during the budget vote. I think that the government was ashamed of how it went about doing things. It wanted to tie that to passage of the budget, yet it gave $14 billion to big companies last year. So what has that billion dollars done so far? Absolutely nothing.</ParaText><ParaText id="996363">Our people have no choice but to leave their homes to go work out west. I hear the Conservatives telling people in the Atlantic provinces to go work out west, to go work out there because there are so many jobs that they have to bring in people from other countries. Working out west hurts our families and our people. These people are forced to go out west, but government regulations offer nothing in the way of support, such as employment insurance. If a person goes out west for three months and then has to come back home, that person cannot take advantage of a temporary layoff to go see family. These workers live in camps. Then when they come home, hoping to collect employment insurance for a brief period of time, they are not entitled. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996364">Last week, when we were back in our ridings, I met a man who went to work out west. I plan to take this matter up with the authorities. He worked either 660 or 630 hours out there. He returned to New Brunswick, and when he called the employer to ask for his total number of hours, the employer said that he had worked 10 and a half hours. The employee brought me all of his employer-issued pay stubs, which showed that he had worked 630 hours. He contacted Revenue Canada, and was told that he needed his T-4 to complete his tax return. He then called the company, and was told that he had worked only 10 and a half hours. He told them that no, he had worked 630 hours, and that he had all the pay stubs to prove that he had worked for them.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp><ParaText id="996365">The company representatives responded by saying that they had heard enough from him, and just like that, they hung up on him, telling him to sort out his problems himself. And there was another worker who left for the same reasons. </ParaText><ParaText id="996366">In addition, regarding the forestry crisis, it is important to solve the problems at home, in our ridings. We must help our fellow citizens survive. They need more than $1 billion. We must help improve their quality of life—</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

								<Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That, in the opinion of the House, the government should introduce a series of measures to assist businesses, communities and workers hard hit by the forestry crisis, including: (<I>a</I>) an economic diversification program aimed specifically at communities that depend heavily on the forest industry; (<I>b</I>) tax measures that encourage the development of processing activities in the region; (<I>c</I>) a government loan and loan guarantee program for business modernization; (<I>d</I>) a refundable tax credit for the research and development of new products; (<I>e</I>) the establishment of absolute reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions, allowing businesses to sell emission credits on an exchange; (<I>f</I>) a program to support the production of energy and ethanol from forest waste; (<I>g</I>) improvements to the employment insurance plan; and (<I>h</I>) an income support program for older workers.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996371">In my speech, I will cover each of these points. With regard to the employment insurance plan, I will talk about a specific case that occurred in Charlevoix last year and serves as an excellent example. I will also show that a worker of 57 or 58 who has been laid off and is receiving employment insurance does not necessarily have an easy time finding a new job.</ParaText><ParaText id="996372">The forestry crisis is hitting Quebec especially hard, because of the loss of 88,000 jobs in sawmills and pulp and paper plants. More than 230 cities, towns and villages depend primarily on the forestry industry. I will also come back to each of these points. A further 160 cities, towns and villages depend exclusively on the forestry industry. Nearly half of the forest communities in Canada depend on the forestry industry, which has been a key factor in settlement patterns in Quebec. </ParaText><ParaText id="996373">A region such as the North Shore—the large riding of Manicouagan, which extends from Rivière Betsiamites to Blanc-Sablon, including Anticosti Island, Fermont and Schefferville—owes its development largely to the forestry industry. Forestry is a Quebec industry, because we have the forest resources. Unfortunately, as the saying goes, the more forestry workers that have jobs in the forestry industry, the more the forest recedes. What the forestry industry needs is a comprehensive plan. But one gets the impression that the Conservative government cannot see the forest for the trees; it cannot see all the problems in the forestry industry.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996374">The crisis in the manufacturing and forestry industries in Quebec is very serious. Since the Conservatives came to power, the manufacturing industry has lost 78,000 jobs, the majority of all jobs lost in Canada. Since 2005, the forestry industry—including related services such as transportation and forestry equipment—has lost 21,000 jobs, half of all the jobs lost in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="996375">When we talk about the forestry and manufacturing industries, but mainly the forestry industry, we think about the people who work in the sawmills. But beyond the sawmills there is a whole system: people work in the forest; transportation companies take timber from the forest to the sawmill for secondary or tertiary processing. Today, with modernization, paper mills use chippers to turn wood residues into pulp. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp><ParaText id="996376">Since the Conservatives came to power, more than 25% of forestry jobs in Quebec have disappeared. Between 2004 and 2007, the forestry industry in some regions of Quebec has experienced devastation and catastrophe.</ParaText><ParaText id="996377">It is important to highlight these revealing figures, which date from the summer of 2007. The situation has deteriorated since then because, within the forestry industry, many sawmills have closed or cut their hours of operation. </ParaText><ParaText id="996378">In the Upper Laurentians region, for example, 58% of forestry jobs have been lost. In Abitibi-Témiscamingue, 38% have disappeared. In Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, in the riding of my Conservative colleague for <Affiliation DbId="113961" Type="2">Roberval—Lac-Saint-Jean</Affiliation>, 34% of forestry workers have lost their jobs. On the North Shore, where forestry gave rise to and fostered the development of the regions, 32% of jobs have been lost. In Mauricie, 29% have disappeared. These figures are from the summer of 2007. We are now coming up to the summer of 2008 and the problem has grown.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996379">In addition, 160 cities, towns and villages—but mainly villages—rely exclusively on the forestry industry. Take for example the municipality of Rivière-Saint-Jean in my riding. The only industry we had in Rivière-Saint-Jean—I said “we had” because it is no longer in operation—was a softwood lumber mill. People from Minganie, Longue-Pointe-de-Mingan, Rivière-Saint-Jean, Rivière-au-Tonnerre and Sheldrake worked at the only industry in the region. Due to the softwood lumber dispute, the company was not making a profit and had to close its doors. From one day to the next, many workers—more than 100—found themselves on unemployment insurance. Today, the majority of these workers who went on employment insurance are now welfare recipients because EI benefits run out after 35 to 38 weeks, or 40 in some cases.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996380">There was no end in sight to the problems in the forestry industry, no light at the end of the tunnel and, unfortunately, the private owner of the Rivière-Saint-Jean sawmill announced that he was not resuming operations and that his equipment was for sale. This is a hard blow for workers and their families because it demolishes their plans. These people have to pay their mortgages, their monthly power bills, their phone bills, their municipal property taxes and school board taxes. They also have to buy groceries at least once a week to feed their family.</ParaText><ParaText id="996381">That is the situation in Rivière-Saint-Jean and also in Rivière-Pentecôte. What I described for Rivière-Saint-Jean also applies to Rivière-Pentecôte. The sawmill that was located in Rivière-Pentecôte was the lifeblood of that community. There was a time when people who came to that municipality to settle there and work in the forestry, in the sawmill, really put down roots there. Gradually, from generation to generation, these people built homes and settled in Rivière-Pentecôte. The owner of the sawmill in Rivière-Saint-Jean also owned the sawmill in Rivière-Pentecôte. He tried his best to keep the industry going in Rivière-Pentecôte, but he had to close both sawmills. </ParaText><ParaText id="996382">Mr. Speaker, am I already out of time?</ParaText>

He is experiencing stress-related problems. He cannot sit around and play computer games. He is unemployed. He is nervous; he has received a number of fines and he has even had a small accident.

Canada's economic fundamentals are strong. Overall, the national economy is well positioned for long term growth and prosperity. However, the global economy is facing increasing economic uncertainty and there will be challenging times in the years ahead. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996394">This uncertainty means that some of our communities have become and will become vulnerable because of their dependence upon a single employer, or a particular sector might find itself under pressure because of exchange rate fluctuations or declining demand, notably in the United States.</ParaText><ParaText id="996395">As one of Canada's largest employers, with close to 900,000 direct and indirect jobs across the country, the forest industry provides employment in over 300 small and rural communities from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText><ParaText id="996396"> We all know that these are difficult times for the forestry industry, workers and communities right across Canada. The industry has faced significant pressure from a higher Canadian dollar, declining housing starts south of the border and increased competition from low cost producers in Asia and South America.</ParaText><ParaText id="996397"> Regions hit by layoffs, communities plagued by chronic high unemployment and one industry towns facing downturns are precisely the difficult circumstances that the trust has been designed to address.</ParaText><ParaText id="996398">As the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> noted, the trust will support job training and skills development to create new opportunities for workers who wish to move to a sector that is currently facing labour shortages.</ParaText><ParaText id="996399">In terms of economic diversification, the trust could be used to fund community transition plans that encourage economic development and job creation. It might include infrastructure initiatives that stimulate economic diversification.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996400">Other economic development and diversification initiatives that the community development trust could cover include: public utility projects, industrial park development, science and technology development, access to broadband technology, and community and transportation services.</ParaText><ParaText id="996401">Under the terms of the three year, $1 billion trust, the federal government will provide a base amount of $10 million to each province and $3 million to each territory, with the balance of the funding allocated on a per capita basis.</ParaText><ParaText id="996402">The funding will be administered by the provinces and territories, as they are uniquely placed to identify the projects that best respond to community needs. The trust provides provinces and territories with the flexibility to invest in those projects that best help vulnerable communities and individuals. </ParaText><ParaText id="996403">At the same time, the provinces and territories must ensure that projects under consideration respect Canada's obligations under the North American Free Trade Agreement, the World Trade Organization and the Canada-U.S. Softwood Lumber Agreement.</ParaText><ParaText id="996404">As we all know, New Brunswick was the first province to sign onto the trust. Premier Graham noted that the recent downturn in the forest sector had hit the province hard. He welcomed the $30 million that the community development trust will provide to New Brunswick as the province looks for ways to diversify the economy and move away from the concept of one industry towns.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp><ParaText id="996405">The government of New Brunswick has identified several measures to help move the province toward its diversification goal. It plans on supporting economic adjustment in hard-pressed communities such as Dalhousie, Bathurst and Miramichi. It will fund research and development related to the innovative uses of engineered wood, biofuels and energy efficiency. In addition, the province will be examining opportunities for supplying natural gas to northern communities in order to lower energy costs. Finally, New Brunswick has indicated it will be looking at accelerating opportunities in the mining industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="996406">On January 17, Saskatchewan became the second province to partner in the trust. Premier Wall noted that although the province's economy is strong, there are sectors and regions that can benefit from strategic investment from the federal government. Funding priorities under the trust identified by Saskatchewan include: biofuels and sustainable energy development; infrastructure; and support for communities impacted by layoffs in the forestry sector.</ParaText><ParaText id="996407">On March 11, British Columbia became the third province to sign on to the trust. Its share, $129 million, will support forestry related provincial initiatives to provide skills training and upgrading for laid-off workers. The funding will also be used to provide transition assistance to older workers and create new job opportunities in forestry dependent communities.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996408">Just last week, on March 27, Ontario became the latest province to sign on. The community development trust will provide Ontario with $358 million to support programs that improve productivity and competitiveness, technology development, and training for workers and communities facing challenges in industries such as forestry, agriculture and manufacturing.</ParaText><ParaText id="996409">Today, just a few hours ago, the <Affiliation DbId="78754" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries and Oceans</Affiliation> and the premier of Newfoundland and Labrador announced that they have signed an agreement to further this community development trust for Newfoundland and Labrador.</ParaText><ParaText id="996410">We welcome the participation of all provinces and territories in the community development trust; for it is by working together that the federal, provincial and territorial governments can best help turn the economic challenges we face today into economic opportunities tomorrow. We look forward to other provinces signing agreements too.</ParaText><ParaText id="996411">The trust builds on a number of measures that this government has undertaken for the forestry sector since it was elected just over two years ago. </ParaText><ParaText id="996412">Less than nine months into our mandate we resolved the costly and prolonged softwood lumber dispute. The agreement that we negotiated ended years of costly litigation and repaid over $5 billion Canadian in duty deposits, a significant infusion of capital for the industry that benefits communities and workers.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996413">In addition, as part of budget 2006, we introduced a $400 million forestry assistance package to assist worker adjustment, to address the pine beetle infestation in western Canada, and to encourage the long term competitiveness of the forestry industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="996414">We delivered on these commitments too. The targeted initiative for older workers was originally a $70 million program. In budget 2008 we provided an additional $90 million for this program, for a total of $160 million and extended it to 2012. Cost shared with provinces and territories, this program is designed to address the needs of older workers who have lost their jobs in communities where the local economy faces ongoing unemployment or where industries such as forestry, and in the case of Newfoundland and Labrador, the fishery and agriculture are affected by downsizing and closures.</ParaText><ParaText id="996415">At roughly the same time we announced funding of $1.275 million to address long term competitiveness in the forestry industry. The initiatives, promoting innovation and investment, expanding market opportunities, developing a national forest pest strategy and forming a human resource forest sector council, help create the environment necessary for our forestry industry to compete internationally.</ParaText><ParaText id="996416">Through budget 2008 we have provided $10 million over two years so that Natural Resources Canada can promote Canada's forestry sector in international markets as a model of environmental innovation and sustainability.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996417">In conclusion, this government has supported and will continue to support the Canadian forestry industry. The actions we have taken and are continuing to take make this abundantly clear. It is clear to Canadians from coast to coast. It is clear to people working in the forestry industry from coast to coast. I believe it should be clear to the members opposite.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

This motion is very relevant. There is currently a major forestry crisis in Quebec and Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="996420">Today, March 31, is a rather symbolic date. Unfortunately, today is the day that the current budget ends. And so far, the Conservative government will have spent $10 billion to pay down the debt, while it knowingly decided to let the forestry industry sort out its own problems.</ParaText><ParaText id="996421">At midnight tonight, $10 billion will be put towards the debt. The government could have paid $3 billion, and used the other $7 billion to stimulate the economy, as recommended by economic stakeholders from Canada and from international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund.</ParaText><ParaText id="996422">For a year, the forestry sector has been experiencing a terrible crisis. We should remember that a year ago we were starting to see companies experience difficulties and go under because of the value of the dollar, and jobs were being lost. The other companies, the ones that were stronger and had good management, held on. This year, we are seeing the second, or even third, wave of closures.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996423">In my riding, Maibec had to close its doors for three months, even though it was a very stable, well managed company. Thus, it is not a question of the quality of management or staff. There was an opportunity to help that company diversify its economy. </ParaText><ParaText id="996424">The same thing happened at Bois Daaquam, in Saint-Just-de-Bretenières. The employees agreed to adjust their salary based on lumber prices. That is a considerable sacrifice. Significant action was taken by workers, manufacturers, employers and communities. The federal government, however, decided to allocate $10 billion to the debt, turning a blind eye to the reality facing our forestry industries. It is therefore important—very important—to put the necessary measures on the table. That is what is proposed by the motion presented by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78419" Type="2">Montmorency—Charlevoix—Haute-Côte-Nord</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="996425">It is not a matter of giving people a handout, but rather, creating a real assistance policy for the forestry industry. We have the means to do so. We had the means and we still have them today.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996426">Before this day ends, we could decide to allocate considerable funding to boost the forestry and manufacturing industries. I would remind the House that, a few weeks ago, we voted on the creation of a trust for regional economic diversification in the amount of $1 billion. That took only five minutes.</ParaText><ParaText id="996427">The Conservatives decided to adopt a laissez-faire policy, leaving entire communities in Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia and across Canada to fend for themselves. We must be clear: the federal government's action is deliberate.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996428">It decided not to help those communities and not to help the forestry industry. It is going to put that $10 billion surplus toward the debt at midnight tonight. In the meantime, it is telling the entire forestry industry to cope on its own with plant closures and job losses. Instead of being there to help people in the industry, the government acts like a private company, pocketing the surplus and paying off the debt as soon as possible.</ParaText><ParaText id="996429">They have forgotten that they were elected to Parliament to represent the people. The Conservatives are behaving just as though they were multinational company shareholders, trying to get the best return on their investment regardless of how that will affect people. </ParaText><ParaText id="996430">The fact that we are having this debate today is very significant. It would have been very doable to take part of the $10 billion surplus that they are going to put toward the debt and create an economic diversification program aimed specifically at communities that depend heavily on the forest industry. The billion dollars allocated to the manufacturing and forestry industries is not nearly enough. The Government of Quebec, the Government of Ontario and many other stakeholders have all said it is not good enough. The government should allocate much more money and implement tax measures to encourage the development of processing activities in the region. Instead, the government has decided to reduce funding for the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec next year. The agency will have less money, not more, but not to worry, because that is how the Conservatives do things around here.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="00">(1200)</Timestamp><ParaText id="996431">They will try to invest as little as possible in the economy and let the market work everything out. Even though regions and businesses have to close their doors, nobody will be able to help them because the Conservatives made a conscious choice to abandon those regions. That did not happen by accident. I am sure that voters in those regions will not forget that choice. When the time comes for people to vote in the next election, I will tell them to remember how the Conservative government had to choose either to allocate part of the year's $10 billion surplus to helping the forest industry or to pay down the debt. It decided to spend all of the money on the debt. As a result, regions that rely on forestry were left to their own devices. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996432">The Conservative members, particularly those from Quebec, who voted in favour of the last budget and who said nothing about this issue, were elected to represent Ottawa in the regions rather than the opposite. Had they decided to represent their regions, they would have said that part of the $10 billion surplus should have been used to stimulate the forestry industry. Instead, this money will be used to pay down the debt while entire communities are suffering from the forestry crisis. There would have been money, for example, for a refundable tax credit for the research and development of new products, a program to support the production of energy and ethanol from forest waste, and improvements to the employment insurance plan. This plan generated a $54 billion surplus that was used to cover Canada's deficit and is now going to be used to pay down the debt. These workers contributed for 10 to 15 years. Today, the government has made no effort to help these people even though we have a $10 billion surplus. This is the customary approach of the rich who close their eyes to avoid helping members of society in need. That always ends up biting us in the backside. That will happen to the Conservative government if it does not change its strategy, its attitude. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996433">I am very surprised that members from regions in Quebec and Canada where forestry is an important part of the economy did not all stand up in this House and demand that we reinvest part of the surplus and use it to help the forestry industry rather than paying down the debt.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996434">The government could have created an income support program for older workers. The members from the regions in this House, who visited plants during the election campaign, saw people aged 45, 48, 50, 52, 55, 56 and 58 who had worked very hard for 20 to 30 years in the plants. Today, we are seeing catastrophic plant closures and job losses. A host of people aged 56, 57, 58 and 60 are without jobs. All the current government is telling them is to try to find a job out west, to try to find a job in the computer field. You have spent your whole life measuring wood and suddenly you have to take a course to become a computer technician. When some of the members here lose their jobs, they will see how easy it is for someone between 55 and 60 to find another job. If Canada still had a deficit, the government could say that choices have to be made. But the federal government has had a surplus for several years.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="996435">I will conclude on that point. As of March 31, 2008, Canada has a $10 billion surplus that, at midnight tonight, will be used to pay down the government's debt. Meanwhile, there are families that cannot make ends meet and communities that cannot get their economy going again, all because of the Conservative government.</ParaText><ParaText id="996436">Every member of this House who voted for the budget and does not want to increase the funding in the trust for regional economic diversification is supporting the Conservatives' decision to abandon our forest communities. This is unacceptable, and that is why we encourage them to look to the example of the motion introduced by the member, who clearly showed that a concrete action plan could have been put in place and that the money was available. Instead, we are faced with the Conservatives' indifference and inaction. That is what this motion criticizes.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

He found it in the form of post-secondary education cuts to the tune of $309 million. He found it in the form of reduced hospital care for Ontarians by reducing that budget by over $600 million. He cut housing and social assistance by over $700 million. </ParaText><ParaText id="996464">As the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> is fond of pointing out in the House, I am also a fan of corporate tax cuts.

When Mr. McGuinty came to power, he was faced with a $5.6 billion deficit left to him by the previous Conservative government of which Canada's finance minister had been an important member. Canada's <Affiliation DbId="105835" Type="4">environment minister</Affiliation> was also an important member. On top of that, Mr. McGuinty was facing a dangerous underfunding of social programs due to cuts by the previous Tory administration.</ParaText><ParaText id="996466"> Many of these funding cuts have been cited as contributing factors to tragic events like the Walkerton water crisis. Had that Conservative government, in which the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> was a central player, not cut 40% of the environment budget and laid off 900 of that ministry's 2,400 workers, perhaps something like Walkerton could have been avoided.

When the economy hits a wall due to circumstances that are short-term and structural, it is the responsibility of the governments to intervene.</ParaText><ParaText id="996638">Two weeks ago, an organization that is known for its restrictive policies, the International Monetary Fund, encouraged countries to increase spending. We agree.</ParaText><ParaText id="996639">The government has a duty to intervene, which the Conservatives are not doing. Their industrial policy is nothing but magical thinking.  For example, they have not announced a program to help companies modernize, nor have they announced an industrial research support program. Even worse, they cut Technology Partnerships Canada, the main industrial research program. For the aeronautics industry, the new program is more generous than before this government came into power. As for the other leading-edge sectors, such as pharmaceuticals, expanding environmental technologies, new materials or production technologies, they have been left to their own devices.</ParaText><ParaText id="996640">When an industrial sector is in danger of collapsing because of an increase in imports, Ottawa systematically refuses to establish safeguards to give the industry time to adapt. And when the government makes purchases, it does so without any thought of the economic impact. Every time the Conservatives are criticized for their inaction, they invariably point out that they have lowered taxes. But, in 2006 the manufacturing sector in Quebec made zero profit, and a business that makes no profit pays no taxes. So much for a business support measure.</ParaText><ParaText id="996641">In the February 2007 report on the manufacturing industry, the members of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology were unanimous when they said we need to act. All of the members, including the Conservative members, recognized that the manufacturing sector is in crisis, that all sectors of the industry have been affected, that the government's inaction is not a response and that industry needs to be much better supported through tax measures, budget measures, trade actions and structural investments.</ParaText><ParaText id="996642">It is more than a year later, and the government has yet to hear the cry for help. Of the 22 unanimous recommendations made by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, the government has implemented only one—a tax reduction for businesses who invest in the form of an accelerated capital cost allowance. This is another tax reduction.</ParaText><ParaText id="996643">We believe that in order to achieve prosperity, for example, which is at the core of this motion, we must focus on research and development, which require support from all levels of government.</ParaText><ParaText id="996644">The Quebec government did so in the past, under Bernard Landry and what he called the technological conversion or shift. While Quebec was going through a very serious economic crisis, Landry's team established a new economic policy focused on building Quebec. Partnership with the private sector is the guiding principle that will allow the government to promote the development of new technologies.</ParaText><ParaText id="996645">Quebec's current technological edge compared to other western economies suggests that interventionism, in partnership with the private sector, creates wealth and knowledge. All that is working. Thus, it is crucial that the risks be shared by the government and knowledge-based businesses in order to develop a modern, diversified economy. The countries that are most successful in this area know this. </ParaText><ParaText id="996646">The federal government, however, continues to adopt a laissez-faire attitude that is counterproductive for Quebec. Until Quebec is equipped with every economic lever, the Bloc Québécois will defend in this House Quebec's decision to provide an environment that is competitive and advantageous for its businesses. </ParaText><ParaText id="996647">The federal government, however, guided by its right-wing ideology, does not want to become involved in economic development. The laissez-faire attitude is the Conservatives' solution to all economic problems, and we see this again with the recent <Affiliation DbId="111555" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation>. However, the knowledge-based economy needs support from the government to develop, evolve, break into new markets and deal with competition from countries that do support their industry.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp><ParaText id="996648">Many governments have understood that. The Conservatives rely on the free market when the true reality of the market is that our competitors are benefiting from government assistance. Doing nothing might work for the cities of Edmonton and Calgary, but for Montreal it puts the brakes on development. Just because the rest of Canada is becoming wealthier from oil production does not mean that Quebec should pay the price.</ParaText><ParaText id="996649">The federal government is not a reliable partner for Quebec when it comes to funding research and development. The federal government's share of research and development funding has dropped in the past 30 years. In 1971, the federal government covered 45% of research and development spending in Canada. In 2003, it covered just 18.7%. Without Quebec, Canada would be devoting just 1.4% of its GDP to research and development, which is slightly more than the Czech Republic. Canada ranks 13th in OECD countries and fifth out of the seven G-7 countries. As a sovereign country, Quebec would be above average and rank fifth among the 30 OECD member countries. Only Sweden, Finland, Japan and Iceland make a greater effort.</ParaText><ParaText id="996650">Ottawa is not a reliable partner for Quebec. High-tech industries are experiencing great uncertainty and Quebec's economy is suffering the consequences far more than Canada's economy. To prosper, we must build on our strengths. The aerospace industry is one of our strengths. The Conservative government does not really have an aerospace policy and it has no intention of developing one. The striking example of this dogmatic laissez-faire attitude is the lack of respect toward Quebec in federal contracts awarded to an American company, Boeing, for military transport aircraft. What is more, the Conservatives have made it clear they would do the same thing in the future.</ParaText><ParaText id="996651">Depending on the year, Quebec's aerospace industry represents 55% or 60% of Canada's aerospace industry. It would only be normal for Quebec to get its fair share of the spinoffs from the federal aerospace contracts. In our opinion, Quebec's fair share is somewhere between 55% and 60%. The total amount of spinoffs from the military aerospace contracts is $9.2 billion. Unfortunately, because Ottawa lets American companies decide the fate of the aerospace industry, Quebec will not be getting its fair share.</ParaText><ParaText id="996652">Nevertheless, Quebec is the aerospace leader in Canada with $11 billion in deliveries, the majority of which, or 89%, are exports. I would like to point out again that Quebec is the leader in this industry in Canada. Calling on the federal government to recognize this Quebec economic reality is not asking for charity. </ParaText><ParaText id="996653">We feel that this is an attempt to weaken the foundation of the Quebec economy at a very critical time. Overly dependent on pumping their revenue from the ground, the Conservatives can see no other way of creating wealth. For the Conservatives, finding oil in Quebec is the way to make it wealthy. However, in Quebec, we believe that wealth is the product of creativity and competence. Quebec's economy is different from that of Canada and the government should recognize this fact.</ParaText><ParaText id="996654">We believe that contributing to Quebec's wealth requires that the federal government change its bad procurement policies, that it stop abandoning the aerospace industry and that it put in place a true aerospace policy. If the federal government does not understand the interests of the Quebec economy, then it should hand over the money to the Government of Quebec. It would thus be saying, loud and clear, that Quebec is a nation and its actions would support this statement.</ParaText><ParaText id="996655">Another means of increasing prosperity is to invest in education. We believe it is very urgent that transfer payments for post-secondary education be increased. Some believe that there is no longer a fiscal imbalance because federal transfers have increased a great deal. However, the reality is that, in comparison to federal revenue, transfers are lower than they were in 1995. For every dollar of federal revenue, 7.3¢ were transferred in 1995 compared to only 6.2¢ in 2007. This is especially true for education transfers, which need $3.5 billion to return to 1995 levels, or $817 million for Quebec.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp><ParaText id="996656">All Quebeckers agree that there is a need for increased transfers for post-secondary education. Everyone in Quebec—employers and unions, people on both the left and the right—is aware that education must be a national priority. The National Assembly is unanimous about the need to increase federal transfers. The only elected members who disagree or are indifferent are the federal members of the Canadian parties from Quebec. There are 200 elected members from Quebec: 125 in the National Assembly and 75 in the House of Commons. The 125 members of the National Assembly plus the 48 Bloc members make 173 elected members calling for an increase in education transfers. Only 27 members are opposed or indifferent. </ParaText><ParaText id="996657">We need to find $817 million for post-secondary education for Quebec. This is crucial for Quebec. We have many universities, ENAP, the École de technologie supérieure, university hospitals and CEGEPs. We know that the future lies in post-secondary education. We know that the future of our companies and the success of our economy depend on qualified personnel. </ParaText><ParaText id="996658">These transfers must be injected into the economy every year. For us, investment in education is a long-term investment.</ParaText><ParaText id="996659">Another key to prosperity is to bank on the environment. Everyone—the National Assembly, employers, unions, environmentalists and ordinary citizens—wants the Kyoto protocol to be implemented. For years, we have been saying that Quebec needs to reduce its dependence on oil. All societies will have to come to this point sooner or later, because oil is a non-renewable resource. One day there will be no more oil. So why not take the lead and give ourselves a huge strategic advantage for the future? Because, unfortunately, we are dealing with a Conservative government that is a servant of the oil industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="996660">The plan the <Affiliation DbId="105835" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> introduced a few weeks ago goes completely against Quebec's economic interests. Not only does it not recognize Quebec's past efforts, but it saddles us with a burden that should be borne by the oil and gas industry. The Harper government's plan means that Quebec is paying for others' pollution. It is the antithesis of the Kyoto protocol. Allow me to explain. The goal of the Kyoto protocol is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The goal of the Harper government is to let the oil companies increase emissions, but with greater intensity, which means that if the oil companies increase their emissions—</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Scheer" id="2381850"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="114225" Type="93">The Acting Speaker (Mr. Andrew Scheer)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="996661">Order, please.

For all the social programs they are up, as are per capita transfers in everything except health care spending. Our case is actually a solid one. It is one which says that Ontario could afford both to invest in social programs and to make the business tax cuts now. Proof positive is that $2.1 billion in business tax revenues, unexpected in the Ontario budget, would have paid for business tax cuts now, which could have created jobs starting today. That is the right track.</ParaText><ParaText id="996720">What the NDP is talking about is the absolute wrong track. The NDP took us to the brink of have not status in Ontario in 1995.

Bryon Wilfert (Richmond Hill, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="996731">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in today's debate. I must indicate that it is actually a rather sad commentary that we need to have this debate.</ParaText><ParaText id="996732">The debate obviously is centring on supporting and investing in the province of Ontario, the economic engine of Canada, on the need to have good federal-provincial-territorial cooperation, and on the fact that almost a year ago, on March 19, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> said that we really needed to end this unproductive bickering between the provinces and the federal government. Certainly at that time I would have agreed with him. </ParaText><ParaText id="996733">I am rather disappointed that over the last seven weeks we seem to have gotten into very unproductive verbal warfare with the province of Ontario. It clearly is not helpful for the province. It is not helpful for the country. It certainly sends out the wrong message when it comes to investing in this country, particularly in Ontario, which has been hard hit in a number of sectors. I will certainly go over that.</ParaText><ParaText id="996734">Clearly if we are going to respect not only jurisdictions but the fact that we need to work together, particularly when we are seeing bumps in the road with regard to the economy, this kind of strategy, if we can call it that, certainly does not augur well in terms of dealing with plants that are shut down and with workers who are now thrown out and need retraining. To invest in this province is critical. The messaging we have heard from the federal government has not been at all helpful.</ParaText><ParaText id="996735">For example, before we even get into the economy, I note that the government produced Bill <Document DbId="3095148" Type="3">C-22</Document> on the issue of representation for a future Parliament. Again, based on the numbers and the increase in population, one would have assumed that Ontario would receive 20 additional seats. Under the legislation, we in Ontario receive 10 seats. We of course support more seats for British Columbia and Alberta, but not at the expense of the province of Ontario.</ParaText><ParaText id="996736">Where were the Ontario members on that side of the House when this issue came up? They were silent. That silence has been deafening. It is this side of the House and the Liberal Party that have stood up, along with the premier of Ontario, to say that this cannot go forward, that this is obviously not in the interests of the people of Ontario. Again, the members on that side, particularly the members from Ontario, have been very quiet when it comes to this particular piece of legislation. That is not in the interests of Ontario. That is not in the interests of the country at all. </ParaText><ParaText id="996737">The question becomes why. There seems to be a pattern developing here. Again, when we look at the issue of the economy, we look at the area of infrastructure. We know that the Federation of Canadian Municipalities released a report late last year which said that there was a $123 billion infrastructure deficit in Canada and that this infrastructure deficit needed to be addressed.</ParaText><ParaText id="996738">We know that the Conservative Party has always been silent on infrastructure. It certainly was when former prime minister Mulroney was in power. In 1983 when the FCM proposed the original infrastructure program, it lay dormant under that government. It was not until the government of Jean Chrétien came in that we in fact embraced a national infrastructure program whereby all three orders of government were able to contribute.</ParaText><ParaText id="996739">Unfortunately, however, infrastructure is not simply about roads, bridges and sewer plants. It deals with issues of productivity and issues of innovation. In order to make our cities and our communities more competitive, we need to address the infrastructure deficit. Unfortunately, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4"> finance minister</Affiliation> said that the government was “not in the pothole business”. In fact, as a former president of the FCM, I had not heard that language in over 10 years. I thought it was <I>Back to the Future</I>.</ParaText><ParaText id="996740">When it comes to infrastructure issues, we need to be investing, not recycling. The government proudly announced its $33 billion program, of which $17 billion was recycled money. Mayors and councillors know when somebody is trying to hoodwink them. The reality is that we cannot simply recycle. We need to make genuine investments in these areas in order assist our cities and communities so that we can be competitive, not only at home but obviously on the international stage. We cannot do that if governments only think that the role of the federal government is certainly not to be in “the pothole business”.</ParaText><ParaText id="996741">I can tell members that there are many mayors and councillors across this country who took issue with that and very clearly believe that at the end of the day, if we do not invest, it is going to get worse. A deficit of $123 billion is obviously one that we need to address and to address very carefully.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp><ParaText id="996742">For the province of Ontario to move goods and services, whether it be at the border or between communities, we need that kind of support and leadership from the federal government. It is the leadership that the Liberal Party has shown over the years. We did it in 1994 with the national infrastructure program, which was renewed by successive Liberal governments, again demonstrating that we understand the issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="996743">We also have a national Liberal caucus that deals with cities and communities. It understands these issues. Again, there is silence on the other side when it comes to those kinds of investments for our cities. In fact, if everything were as rosy as some of the members on the other side suggest, then one wonders why the big city mayors caucus of the FCM, and others, continually say that those members do not get it. The government does not get it. Until it does, we are going to have this continual problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="996744">In terms of an investment issue, on infrastructure alone we know the government does not get it. We know the Conservatives do not get it on the environment. Clearly they do not get it when it comes to transit and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. They do not get it in terms of investing in subways and buses and understanding that there is a crying need out there. </ParaText><ParaText id="996745">Again, we should be partners. It is all about partnership. Confederation is about partnership. It is not about “my way or the highway”. It is about working together collaboratively with our partners, whether they be the provinces and territories or the cities and communities across Canada. Again, it is disappointing that we are not seeing that kind of leadership from the other side of the aisle. This is something that we on this side have articulated. We repeatedly have demonstrated partnership when it comes to dealing with the $123 billion deficit on infrastructure.</ParaText><ParaText id="996746">Another thing, of course, is that we have heard the House leader refer to our premier as “the small man of Confederation”. If a government is trying to build collaborative relationships between the federal government and the provinces, then why on earth would those kinds of cheap comments be made about the premier of any province? Certainly in the province of Ontario that was not viewed very positively. In fact, it certainly demonstrated the small-mindedness on that side of the House, and again it shows that the Conservatives do not get it.</ParaText><ParaText id="996747">It all comes down to the fact that the Conservatives do not understand how this country works and what it means to be collaborative. Of course provinces and territories are not always going to agree with the federal government, and vice versa, but it is not done by finger pointing and name-calling. The two governments need to work together.</ParaText><ParaText id="996748">I understand I am going to have to wrap up until after question period because of what is going to happen next, but I thank members for their attention. </ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Galipeau" id="2381886"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="114224" Type="92">The Acting Speaker (Mr. Royal Galipeau)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="996749">The hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78627" Type="2">Richmond Hill</Affiliation> will have 12 and a half minutes left when we resume debate.</ParaText><ParaText id="996750">We will now have statements by members.

Through these visits, officials have sought to have Mr. Khadr’s detention conditions improved and have made requests for medical treatment and educational support.  Officials have also facilitated telephone calls with his family in Canada and access by his Canadian defence lawyers, and have requested repeatedly that Mr. Khadr be given an independent medical and psychological assessment. </ParaText><ParaText id="997057">In response to (e), Canadian officials have been present as observers at all proceedings against Mr. Khadr in Guantanamo Bay, as well as to the hearing at the Court of Military Commission Review in Washington.  </ParaText><ParaText id="997058">In response to (f), there are no charges outstanding against Omar Khadr in Canada that could be a basis for an extradition request.  </ParaText><ParaText id="997059">In response to (g), the government has received unequivocal assurances from U.S. authorities that Mr. Khadr will not be subject to the death penalty.

</ParaText><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Wilfert" id="2382212"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78627" Type="2">Hon. Bryon Wilfert (Richmond Hill, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="997091">Mr. Speaker, I want to continue on the theme of lack of accountability and a transparency with regard to the government, particularly on this issue. </ParaText><ParaText id="997092">We talked about the need to be cooperative in Confederation and the need to work collaboratively. There will be times when people will not agree on issues but I find it surprising that a finance minister from the province of Ontario would stand up repeatedly and basically say that people should not invest in the province of Ontario, the economic engine of Canada, when we have problems in the auto, manufacturing and forestry sectors.</ParaText><ParaText id="997093">There is no question that the minister may be fighting old battles. Maybe he wants to be leader of the Conservative Party in the province of Ontario but the job is currently occupied. I would suggest that going after the province and suggesting how it should run its budget and how it should address the priorities, and governing is all about priorities, is really not the concern of the federal government. </ParaText><ParaText id="997094">The federal government needs to get its own house in order. As we know, the government has spent like a drunken sailor over the last two years to the point, according to the ministry of finance, that it is at 0.7% of going back into a deficit, something which this side of the House and this party got this country out of when we inherited a $42.5 billion deficit in 1993. We became the only G-7 country to pay down the national debt and the only G-7 country not to have a deficit.</ParaText><ParaText id="997095">When we look at the expenses of the government we see that spending has gone up 14.8%, which was highlighted by no less than the Canadian Taxpayers Federation. Government spending has gone up a record high. The reality is that we talked about and took action on corporate taxes as a government. We dropped them significantly from about 28% down to 19% and then the current government subsequently dropped them another half percent.</ParaText><ParaText id="997096">The reality is that it is about investment as well. Under the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, when he was the minister in the province of Ontario under the Harris government, they left a $5.6 billion deficit. Yes, it cut taxes but, unfortunately, it closed about 29 hospitals and fired 8,000 nurses and infrastructure problems became the norm.</ParaText><ParaText id="997097">We know about the 25% cut to the ministry of the environment. What led to Walkerton? Those kinds of things left Ontario in a sad state and, as we know, when an independent audit came in under the new McGuinty government, it discovered that the books were not as reported and it had a $5.6 billion deficit.</ParaText><ParaText id="997098">Why are the hon. members from Ontario not standing up for Ontario on that side of the House? Why are they not standing and saying that we need to invest in the auto and manufacturing sectors and that we need to be proactive in ensuring that people in Ontario who are losing their jobs are assisted in areas of retraining? We had a member of the government go to Queen's Park when the budget was announced denouncing the government, again not working in collaboration with them but denouncing them. It was sort of a big brother approach which, I am sure, is quite interesting given the fact that the Conservatives came into power suggesting that they would have a new era of cooperation with the provinces and territories.</ParaText><ParaText id="997099">The Conservatives have done nothing to help the manufacturing and forestry sectors. We are talking about people who are losing their jobs and who need retraining. They have even denounced the issue of retraining in the province of Ontario. We need to be investing. When they attack the Ontario government, regardless of political stripe, they are not doing any favours for the people who live in that province, not stepping up to the plate and asking how we can work collaboratively.</ParaText><ParaText id="997100">Members will remember that when the Harris-Eves government was in power there were six out of eight deficit budgets totalling $28.4 billion. Those people claimed to be the fiscal managers and yet the same group that is now in charge is leading us down the same road, again, 0.7% away from a deficit. When it comes to fiscal management we do not need to take any lessons from that side of the House. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="25">(1525)</Timestamp><ParaText id="997101">We are the ones, with the help of Canadians, who put the country back on the right track. We see the kind of situation today when the government is heartless and unwilling to help those most in need, which is a major concern to people in my constituency. </ParaText><ParaText id="997102">Not long after the Premier of Ontario came into office he said:</ParaText><ParaText id="997103"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">After eight years of Tory government, the bottom line is: our schools are worse off, our health care is worse off, our environment is worse off and we face a Tory deficit of $5.6 billion.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="997104"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">It's a devastating record, given that these have been years of often spectacular economic growth. Clearly, it was time for a change, and we are working hard to deliver that change. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="997105">That is clearly an indictment. We believe on this side of the House about a balanced approach in terms of dealing with personal taxes, corporate taxes but also to invest. I spoke earlier about the Federation of Canadian Municipalities identifying the $123 billion deficit with regard to infrastructure across Canada. The response of the government has been a pittance. It recycles money instead of saying that we need to ensure that Canada takes the lead when it comes to innovation. When it comes to investment opportunities, this is the place to invest and, obviously, not just in Ontario but across the country. </ParaText><ParaText id="997106">However, when we see this kind of negative approach by the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and by government members, it is not surprising that people look elsewhere in terms of investment opportunities.</ParaText><ParaText id="997107">What is the strategy? Why would a minister of finance from the province of Ontario attack his own province, regardless of political stripe? Either it is old battles or the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> does not understand his own province, which would be quite an indictment not to understand its importance. He comes from an area of Ontario where issues of transit are absolutely critical, where moving people, goods and services are absolutely imperative and yet he has a very callous approach. I talked earlier about the pothole comment, not understanding that all orders of government, including municipal, need to work effectively together and yet we do not see that support at all. </ParaText><ParaText id="997108">We see a rail link from Peterborough to Toronto for 900 individuals, which is very nice, except when it comes to investing in the greater Toronto area and the extension of the Yonge Street subway up to Richmond Hill, which was one of the things the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> with the premier and others announced in June of last year, we see no money and no action on that. There is a need to move people in a growing area like York region but we have seen no action. Where are the Ontario members when it comes to those kinds of issues? They are silent.</ParaText><ParaText id="997109">On the issue of the environment, the government has dragged its feet on the coal plants and has delayed assisting and reducing those for over a year. We hear nothing but the blame game from the Conservatives who have been the government for two years. They need to take action in dealing with environmental issues and greenhouse gas issues. If they do not believe in the science and the fact that the environment and climate change is a reality, I guess this is what we get. We see that they did not believe that because some of the same players, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="105835" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation>, were in charge when we saw the cutbacks of 25% to the provincial ministry of the environment at the time they were part of the Harris government.</ParaText><ParaText id="997110">In the area of manufacturing, we have lost 100,000 jobs since January 2006, jobs that are very hard to recoup, but the government has made no approach to respond to that. We have 20,000 jobs lost since February 2008 alone. These are devastating numbers. These are a real concern to us on this side of the House. We have enunciated an action plan to deal with those kinds of issues on infrastructure and on job creation, but nothing from the other side. </ParaText><ParaText id="997111">It is a very great concern given the fact of the high dollar. We see a drop of 3.4% or $48.6 billion as of December last year in lost trade opportunities. These are concerns to us on this side of the House.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="30">(1530)</Timestamp><ParaText id="997112">How are we going to address that? The government has put forth a series of budgets where it has spent and spent but has not addressed the key issues that Canadians are looking for and has had no impact in terms of addressing some of these critical issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="997113">We on this side of the House do not believe in deficit financing. We are the party that dealt with the $42.5 billion deficit and eliminated it. We do not believe that the approach of the government is a sound one fiscally because it is moving increasingly toward a deficit.</ParaText><ParaText id="997114">The government took away, for example, the $3 billion contingency fund, which was a fund that was absolutely critical. When we had the SARS situation and the mad cow situation we had a cushion. The $3 billion was there to protect not only the people of Ontario but people right across the country. That was very prudent on behalf of the government of the day. That elimination is of great concern to those of us on this side of the House and it shows the lack of understanding of what is needed to deal with these kinds of situations that occur.</ParaText><ParaText id="997115">We are very much of the mind that these things must be addressed and they obviously have not been addressed in the budget. </ParaText><ParaText id="997116">What is the government's strategy now in terms of dealing with the layoffs in the auto sector? What is its strategy in dealing with the forestry industry? We know it left $1 billion on the table with the Americans on the forestry agreement. </ParaText><ParaText id="997117">The government used to talk about health care but it has not done anything about it in terms of wait times. Some of those ministers were in the Harris government when 29 hospitals in Ontario were closed and 8,000 nurses were fired. Those are not things that we would consider to be progressive. They would not be considered to be thinking ahead in terms of an older population and what we need to be doing. It is not addressing those issues for the people of Ontario. If in fact the government were to take this same approach in Quebec I am sure there would be an absolute revolution. </ParaText><ParaText id="997118">At least the members from Quebec on that side of the House have been much more articulate when it comes to some of these issues. Where are the Ontario members? Why are they not standing up and saying that these issues need to be addressed?</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="35">(1535)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Thibault (Rimouski-Neigette—Témiscouata—Les Basques)" id="2382243"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78894" Type="2">Ms. Louise Thibault (Rimouski-Neigette—Témiscouata—Les Basques, Ind.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="997119">Mr. Speaker, the member spoke very eloquently about the Liberal strategy and extolled the virtues of the Liberals' so-called balanced approach. Obviously—the flip side of the coin—he blamed the Conservative government. I certainly cannot blame him, because I agree with him about this government's lack of vision and lack of real action, for example, with regard to Ontario. The member talked about the auto industry; if he were from Quebec, he would also be talking about the forestry industry. He also talked about the fact that the government is not stepping up to the plate when it comes to environmental issues. </ParaText><ParaText id="997120">My question is very simple.

I know that my friends from the New Democratic Party do not mind an election at any time because they are not likely to be in government in any event, but they are very good at being critical.

Where were Liberal Ontario MPs a year and a bit ago when we brought in budget 2007 with tremendous fiscal balance not just to Ontario but provinces and territories right across the country, something I would dare say again that Liberal members said did not exist? Here we were giving Ontario tremendous capacity to deal with the kinds of questions that he raises in his very questions today.</ParaText><ParaText id="997127">Also, there were additional moneys for infrastructure.

Liberals did not wait for 10 years as the previous Conservative government did and let it lay dormant for 10 years.</ParaText><ParaText id="997130">In 1994, after being elected, Liberals brought in the national infrastructure program, in which all cities, towns, villages, provinces and territories worked collaboratively together. That was infrastructure. We understood that.

If we look at the days when there was a national deficit in this country, never did we hear a word in the chamber with regard to fiscal imbalance. Why? It is because when we do not have any money, nobody comes to ask for any.</ParaText><ParaText id="997132">Under the Liberal government when there began to be surpluses and it started paying down the debt, there was suddenly a fiscal imbalance. The question of fiscal imbalance is rather strange given the fact that the provinces and territories have the same fiscal capacity as the federal government, if not more, if they want to deal with those issues. </ParaText><ParaText id="997133">However, again, this is a government that eliminated the cushion of $3 billion, so that if there is a crisis tomorrow, we will be on the hook because of the incompetence of the government when it comes to dealing with fiscal management.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="40">(1540)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Marston" id="2382264"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78549" Type="2">Mr. Wayne Marston (Hamilton East—Stoney Creek, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="997134">Mr. Speaker, to the member for <Affiliation DbId="78627" Type="2">Richmond Hill</Affiliation>, it strikes me that the remarks we heard in the run up to the Ontario budget, the rhetoric from the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>, struck people as almost a provincial campaign. </ParaText><ParaText id="997135">I am wondering if the member might not agree that if the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> wants to run for the job of premier of Ontario, he should resign his seat to the benefit of the House and seek that job outside of this place where it is appropriate.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Wilfert" id="2382272"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78627" Type="2">Hon.

That is a fact. Ontario has lost 100,000 jobs since January 2006 and another 20,000 in the current year.

There are issues around the rest of the country, but specifically in Quebec over the last few days. Perhaps it is difficult for some of the members opposite to listen to their leader, but in fact their leader not just suggested this but recommended it, and he did not just recommend it but said that it would be in their party platform in the next election, and it is that in fact corporate taxes need to be reduced more aggressively than the approach we have taken.</ParaText><ParaText id="997188">When the member stands in this place today and says the only thing necessary is not to cut taxes, I suggest that he take issue with his leader.

I say it is unusual because there is no doubt about this government's confidence in the vitality of Ontario's economy. In fact, when we speak of Ontario's economy, its sheer size and weight make it actually the greatest and most significant contributor to the Canadian economy. Its economic success is synonymous with Canada's economic success.</ParaText><ParaText id="997196">Our government demonstrates that confidence in Ontario by our actions and our commitments. I am pleased to take a moment here today to highlight some of the measures our government has taken to help ensure the economic vitality of Ontario.</ParaText><ParaText id="997197">These include the historic changes we undertook in budget 2007 to restore fiscal balance in the Canadian federation and measures that responded positively to Ontario's longstanding demands, demands that I must say the previous Liberal government was adamantly against and actually fought strongly against.</ParaText><ParaText id="997198">It is odd, and in fact I think it is quite hypocritical, that the member for <Affiliation DbId="78387" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation> would have the audacity to lecture this Conservative government and this <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> on relations with the province of Ontario. Apparently the member and his Liberal Party colleagues have collective memory problems.</ParaText><ParaText id="997199"> For example, has he completely forgotten that only a few years ago he and the federal Liberal government engaged in an attack on the Liberal premier of Ontario, Dalton McGuinty, going as far as to suggest that Premier McGuinty was a threat to national unity because of his and his government's campaign to have the fiscal balance addressed?</ParaText><ParaText id="997200">Let us go back in time to one speech in particular, a speech the member for <Affiliation DbId="78387" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation> gave at the Toronto Board of Trade in April 2005. In that speech, the member, then a member of the Liberal cabinet and the federal minister for the GTA at the time, launched an all-out assault on the McGuinty government and his own provincial cousins, accusing them of using an “analytically deficient” campaign which threatened to put “the essence of Canada at risk” and was “dangerous for Canada”. He added “that it would only serve to give comfort to Quebec's separatists”.</ParaText><ParaText id="997201">Based on this past experience and the remarks of the member, one can seriously question the appropriateness of his lecturing our government on how to maintain cordial relations with the McGuinty government in Ontario. I would add that the reaction to the member's over the top remarks was unequivocal. </ParaText><ParaText id="997202">A <I>Toronto Star</I> editorial, for instance, lambasted the member for insulting all Ontarians and alleging that the premier, through his work to seek fairer treatment, in fact was intensifying the self-inflicted damage the federal Liberals had done in Quebec with the sponsorship scandal. Responding for Ontario's Liberal government, Dwight Duncan, Ontario's current finance minister, was so outraged that he publicly demanded that the member apologize.</ParaText><ParaText id="997203">Of course, one should not be surprised that the member would take such a position that insulted so many Ontarians, because in government, just as in opposition, the Liberal Party has consistently and vigorously denied that the fiscal imbalance has ever existed, ignoring the valid concerns of provinces like Ontario.</ParaText><ParaText id="997204">No, after nearly a decade of federal Liberal inaction and apparent delusion, it was our Conservative government that took decisive and concrete action to recognize and acknowledge that there was a fiscal imbalance. We demonstrated that through a comprehensive $39 billion plan unveiled in budget 2007, which put federal support for provinces and territories on a long term, predictable and principle based footing for the future.</ParaText><ParaText id="997205">We returned equalization to a principled, formula based program based on the recommendations of the O'Brien expert panel. </ParaText><ParaText id="997206">We made changes that addressed Ontario's deep concerns, including moving to equal per capita support through the Canada social transfer and, in the future, equal per capita cash in other major transfers for infrastructure, job training and health care.</ParaText><ParaText id="997207">Another important change that responded to Ontario's concerns was the inclusion of a provision to ensure that payments to provinces, those becoming wealthier than those provinces not receiving equalization, should be capped, a concept often referred to as the fiscal capacity cap.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp><ParaText id="997208">As a result of restoring fiscal balance, Ontario will receive $13.9 billion in fiscal 2008-09. That is an increase of $1.4 billion from last year and almost $2.7 billion since 2005-06. These transfers include $8.6 billion through the Canada health transfer and $4.1 billion through the Canada social transfer.</ParaText><ParaText id="997209">Ontario's government, understandably, was quite content with this government's actions to address their long-standing grievances regarding fairness in intergovernmental relations. Indeed, many members of the Liberal provincial government were quite open and generous with their praise. </ParaText><ParaText id="997210">The then Ontario finance minister heralded the measures, noting “I think we've made some significant progress, particularly on the issue of fairness in the wonderful world of fiscal federalism”.</ParaText><ParaText id="997211">The then Ontario intergovernmental affairs minister also praised it as “real progress”, adding that she was heartened to see that “the federal government has committed to delivering transfers on a per capita basis in the future, with immediate fairness in the Canada social transfer and many other federal transfers”.</ParaText><ParaText id="997212">Premier McGuinty, who called the action “real progress for Ontarians”, also expressed his appreciation for the respect our Conservative federal government had shown toward the province's concerns. I quote verbatim from a televised interview on CBC Newsworld. He said, “We've made a lot of progress, I would argue, on behalf of all Canadians to try to get beyond an endless series of one-offs and restore some basis of principle to transfers from the federal government to all the provinces and territories. The Prime Minister said that he was now, for the first time in a long time, and I support him fully in this regard, he was going to introduce a principles based approach to dealing with federal transport. No more one-offs and I support that”.</ParaText><ParaText id="997213">Contrast that spirit of cooperation between our Conservative government and the provincial Liberal government with the rather dismissive response that came from the previous Liberal federal government, most notably the member for <Affiliation DbId="78387" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation>. </ParaText><ParaText id="997214">What is even more egregious is that the Liberal Party of Canada not only voted against budget 2007 and its measures to address Ontario's concerns, but it shockingly fought it every step of the way, with not one Liberal member of Parliament joining our Conservative government to stand up for Ontario. Make no mistake, Ontarians noticed.</ParaText><ParaText id="997215">Permit me to quote from an Ottawa <I>Sun</I> editorial from that time, which said:</ParaText><ParaText id="997216"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">—while the Conservative government...is defending Ontario, where do Ontario Liberal MPs stand?....What are Liberal MPs doing now that [the Liberal leader is] ignoring, again, the rights of Ontario taxpayers?

I would like to recognize my colleague for all of the exceptional work and dedication he has put into doing his job as finance critic.

For much of our history, as I said earlier, Ontario has been Canada's true economic engine.

It was a big shock to all of us to find out, after all the sacrifices that had been made over that period of time and the assumptions that we had a balanced budget, that we had a $5.6 billion deficit after enduring many of the cuts we had to go through. As usual, a responsible Liberal government was elected and had to go in and cope with the deficit.</ParaText><ParaText id="997244">The same minister has repeatedly criticized the Ontario Liberal government for the province's investment climate.

I would have much preferred that by this time, an election would have been called, considering the disastrous budget presented by the Conservatives. The public could then have passed judgment on this government, which, instead of building prosperity with employers, employees and leaders, decided simply to play the non-intervention rule. They do nothing. They let the free market reign, and if that causes certain communities to fall apart, particularly in the forestry sector and in single industry towns, that is not a problem; it is how the market works.</ParaText><ParaText id="997296">That is the Conservatives' rule and, ultimately, the entire right-wing American model, which states that the government has no responsibility when it comes to the economy. It must simply leave the market alone and collect the surplus. They tell themselves that, in any case, this allows businesses to employ workers who cost less and, therefore, to find people who will work for lower pay.</ParaText><ParaText id="997297">And that is the choice that the Conservative government has made. Obviously, if the Liberals had stood in the House to vote against the budget, we would be in an election and citizens would be able to judge the government. </ParaText><ParaText id="997298">Today, the Liberal motion gives us an opportunity to explore the situation and to tell the public just how badly the Conservative government has shirked its responsibilities. It decided that it did not want to build prosperity and that it would leave things to the economic stakeholders. Consumerism has been encouraged as the solution to everything. But when the GST is reduced by 1%, this money is put in peoples' pockets and they are all encouraged to buy products made in China, we are not lending any credibility to our economy. Wages have gone down. Now people work in warehouses instead of factories, and they are paid $8 an hour instead of $15. The net result is an increase in the gap between the rich and the poor. This is what the Conservatives have achieved.</ParaText><ParaText id="997299">However, a few weeks ago on November 13, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78399" Type="2">Trois-Rivières</Affiliation>, on behalf of the Bloc Québécois, presented the following substantial motion:</ParaText><ParaText id="997300"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">—immediately establish a series of measures to help the manufacturing and forestry sectors hard hit by the rising dollar and increased competition from new players in the field of low-cost mass production, specifically including a program to support businesses that wish to update their production facilities, a series of investments and tax measures to support research and development in the industry, the re-establishment of an economic diversification program for forestry regions similar to the one that the Conservatives abolished, a review of the trade laws to better protect our companies against unfair competition, and better financial support of workers affected by the crisis in the manufacturing sector.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="997301">This was a substantial motion. The government could have chosen to take action and use the surpluses of the current fiscal year—today, March 31, is effectively the last day of the fiscal year—for that purpose. Nonetheless, the federal government did not want to use a considerable amount of the $10 billion surplus accumulated over the past year. These surpluses are not the result of the government's action, but come from the surplus in taxes paid by Quebec and Canadian taxpayers to the federal government. At the beginning of the year, the government knowingly set objectives too low, which is how it ended up with a $10 billion surplus.</ParaText><ParaText id="997302">But now, entire communities are telling us—whether in the Standing Committee on Finance or the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology or in various other sectors—that they are at the end of their rope. People from the manufacturing sector, entrepreneurs, manufacturers and exporters, labour unions, and the mayors of the communities involved have come to the Standing Committee on Finance to tell us, together and collectively, that the federal government has to go back to the drawing board.</ParaText><ParaText id="997303">We passed a motion to that effect in the Standing Committee on Finance. We forwarded it to the Conservative government. Last week, the Bloc Québécois suggested that an immediate payment of $7 billion out of the $10 billion surplus be made to the trust fund in order to stimulate our economy and allow a number of regions in Quebec, Ontario and other provinces to boost their economies.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp><ParaText id="997304">The current strategy of allowing market forces to prevail has a very negative impact on settlement patterns and the development of rural communities. For this reason, the current government's practice is unacceptable. The Liberal motion at least allows us to focus on these aspects once again. </ParaText><ParaText id="997305">For example, the manufacturing sector is vital to Quebec. It represents 536,000 jobs with total wages of $22 billion, accounting for 17% of employment in 2005, almost 21% of earned income—almost three times as significant as in Alberta—and 90% of Quebec's international exports. Manufacturing deliveries represent 59% of Quebec's gross domestic product. That makes it a very important component of our economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="997306">We have seen that, in this regard, the federal government has decided to not intervene and to play the ostrich by putting its head in the sand—or rather in the oil sands—and stating that Canada's economy is generally doing well. In fact, we are selling a lot of energy abroad. However, we are no longer creating jobs in the manufacturing sector. Things are not so bad; we can continue on our merry way.</ParaText><ParaText id="997307">However, we are coming to realize that the systematic deconstruction of the manufacturing sectors will not be reversible if the Conservative government continues in this direction. That is why elections should have been called. I would have liked to have seen the Conservative candidates meet the voters, the factory workers, and explain to them that they preferred to allocate $10 billion of the surplus to the debt rather than using at least half, or $7 billion, to stimulate the economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="997308">In my riding, the forestry sector is the lifeblood of some communities. There are some very solid, strong companies that made it through the first wave of closures and believed they could survive. Today, entire communities are grappling with closures for three, four or five months of the year. People are beginning to wonder if, in the end, they will have enough employment insurance benefits, if they will have a cheque that will be enough to make ends meet and support their family.</ParaText><ParaText id="997309">People aged 56, 58 or 60, who cannot easily retrain for another job and who are doing their best in that respect, are watching the federal government use $10 billion from the surplus to reduce the debt. Yet, a program to help older workers, until they reach the age of 65 and become eligible for their retirement pension, would have cost $75 million, that is $75 million for one year, compared to $10 billion taken from the surplus to reduce the debt. </ParaText><ParaText id="997310">How can this situation be explained, other than by saying that it reflects a blind implementation of the American right wing theory? In other words, if someone is rich, it is because he deserves to be rich, it is because he developed his potential. On the other hand, if someone is not wealthy, it is because he did not work hard enough and does not do things properly. The growing gap between the rich and the poor will serve our society, and this is how things should be. </ParaText><ParaText id="997311">If the Conservatives continue this practice—and surely they must know this—they will never get the majority government that they want, because right now they are scaring Quebeckers and Canadians, who do not at all want this kind of right wing government, a government that has decided the state no longer has a role to play. The state no longer even has the responsibility to help generate prosperity. That responsibility is left to the market. However, as we can see, it is not working. The interests of the market and of multinational corporations are not the same as those of communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="997312">When we decide to go ahead in the energy sector without assessing the environmental impact, we are not helping our society, quite the contrary. And when we decide to ignore a whole sector of the economy—such as the manufacturing and forestry sectors, which are falling apart—and when, as a government, we are not doing anything about it, we are not assuming our responsibility to create conditions that will promote prosperity. That is what people will tell the Conservatives if, some day, an election is called based on these elements.</ParaText><ParaText id="997313">The Bloc Québécois has been warning for the past 18 months that an economic downturn was on the horizon. Let us use the tools available to us. Let us take the surplus available and make sure that the money is spent in the right places. The International Monetary Fund is telling all developed economies the same thing: ensure that money is invested in infrastructure programs; ensure that the money invested can be used for structuring activities. But just stop putting all the money toward paying down the debt.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp><ParaText id="997314">We could have the best debt-to-GDP ratio if the GDP starts to decline as it might well do before long. If the Conservative government continues along the same course, what is happening in the United States right now will happen in Canada, and we will end up with a better ratio because of paying down the debt, the reason, however, being that the gross domestic product is lower. It would be totally absurd to get to that. </ParaText><ParaText id="997315">Such positions are not taken just to ensure that our manufacturing and forestry industries function, or to receive praise, as we have, from Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, or because the Forest Products Association of Canada said that the Canadian government should go back to the drawing board, but because, at the end of the day, jobs are at stake, and families rely on these jobs.</ParaText><ParaText id="997316">I had the opportunity last week to see the major problems already being created in the United States by the financial situation there. Families are no longer able to hold on to their houses. Loans were made based on a financial system that was left largely unregulated. The President of the United States would have us believe that control can be regained by giving a mandate to the Fed, the central bank of the U.S.A. That does not work. </ParaText><ParaText id="997317">Yes, our economy is stable overall and there is strong demand domestically. However, that will not be enough to counter the fact that, because of what is going on south of the border, we will be exporting less to the United States. This is apparent in all sectors where people sell products to the United States: construction, furniture manufacturing and forest product processing. In all other sectors, there are serious problems because Americans are buying less.</ParaText><ParaText id="997318">What should be done about this? There should be more investment in the manufacturing sector, in the forestry sector and in businesses to help them boost their productivity. The goal is not to subsidize companies' activities, but to give them a tax structure that allows them to develop products while remaining competitive. That will not happen by itself. That has not happened anywhere in the world. All successful employers have received a little help from the state to start up and move forward.</ParaText><ParaText id="997319">Here, the current Conservative government has a tendency to throw the baby out with the bathwater. That is what happened with Technology Partnerships Canada, a program that the Liberals may have abused when it came to certain companies. Overall, however, it was a program that helped businesses create jobs. In my riding, Premier Tech, a company that provides 300 jobs in the region, employs a lot of people—technicians and researchers. Early on, the program financed new product development twice. Those were not subsidies; they were partnerships. Today, money is flowing back to the federal government thanks to that program.</ParaText><ParaText id="997320">Everyone thought the Conservative government should go forward with initiatives like that so that the system could keep working, but the government got stuck in its ideological approach, calling for minimal intervention and expecting the market to sort everything out. With that kind of ideology, when things start going downhill, they go downhill fast. We are now seeing the results of that in the United States. Unfortunately, that is the kind of turmoil we are now facing.</ParaText><ParaText id="997321">The people who came to speak to the Standing Committee on Finance were not just representing unions or the unemployed. They were industrialists from the manufacturing and forestry sectors. They were people who told us that if we did not do something, our jobs would end up being exported. Ultimately, if Canada's energy market were to decline, and we saw some ups and downs a few weeks ago, it would be an economic disaster.</ParaText><ParaText id="997322">Of course, then the Conservative government could have more of a reaction, because of its close ties to the oil industry. It had no reaction for the sectors currently affected, which are primarily in Quebec and Ontario. Furthermore, it is rather strange that a <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> would speak not just one, two or three times, but five to ten times to systematically destabilize Ontario's provincial government, when it would have been much better to work together. </ParaText><ParaText id="997323">The same thing happened with the Government of Quebec.

But imagine the things that could have been done if the federal government had used $7 billion from the surplus to kickstart the economy instead of using $10 billion to pay down the debt. And if it was not interested in doing this through federal programs, all it had to do was transfer the money to the provinces so that they could improve their programs and help their manufacturing and forestry industries.</ParaText><ParaText id="997325">There is no society that will not have manufactured goods. It is not a possibility. By the same token, we will continue to use forest products. However, we must develop new products and prove that we are open to being green by making quality products that respect the environment. Canadians want a sustainable approach from the government, but they have yet to see that from the Conservative government.</ParaText><ParaText id="997326">It is sad that we still find ourselves with a minority government. Logically, the Liberal Party should have voted against the government so that the public could make a decision about these matters. If that had been the case, we would be in the middle or at the end of an election campaign right now, and we would know what the public wanted.</ParaText><ParaText id="997327">The public wants the government to work on building prosperity, and not to simply look at how the economy is running without getting involved, without taking responsibility, without laying the necessary foundations to bring this about. It is essential that the Government of Canada understand that it needs to get away from the framework defined by the American right. We can see where this taking Americans. We need to learn from this and find a different approach.</ParaText><ParaText id="997328">That is what the opposition parties regularly say in this House. That is the point of the Liberal motion today, which says that we must recognize our ability to be prosperous, but we must also work together to achieve these results, which is not currently the case.</ParaText><ParaText id="997329">I also personally believe that this is a perfect example of the fact that year after year, Quebec always has to knock on the federal government's door to recover part of the taxes it pays.

Therefore, it is a strategy of let us cut taxes. But it does say one other thing and that is that the Conservatives seem to deny that the government has a role to play in the lives of people when things go wrong.</ParaText><ParaText id="997333">The member has given some examples. Certainly in Ontario with 100,000 jobs lost in the manufacturing sector in 2007 and a further 20,000 last February, and a 3.4% drop in its sales levels, we have companies which are not making taxable income. Tax cuts are not going to help these companies. </ParaText><ParaText id="997334">We should be investing in labour, retraining, education, EI benefits, a number of the aspects I know the member agrees with. So when companies are faced with situations which are unexpected such as the high U.S. dollar, crude oil at record levels and job losses which are hurting Canadian families, the Government of Canada and the Parliament of Canada has a role to play.</ParaText><ParaText id="997335">I wonder if the member would like to comment on how a linear solution like cutting taxes just does not help the people of Canada.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Crête" id="2382734"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78700" Type="2">Mr. Paul Crête</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="997336">Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.</ParaText><ParaText id="997337">It is not by happenstance or a lack of knowledge about how the economy works. Personally, I think this is the result of deliberate action on the part of the government, of its decision to develop the right-wing American model. This means lowering taxes, having dwindling financial means, no longer having the means to fund social security and other public programs, which means they have to be eliminated, and growing the gap between the haves and the have-nots.</ParaText><ParaText id="997338">I would like to share an example from my riding concerning the latest one-percentage point cut to the GST. Does anyone really believe that, in a village of 1,000 people, that decrease would give the community another important economic tool? Could a much better balance not have been struck by giving our manufacturers a better tax arrangement, by giving them the means to engage in research and development, for example, through refundable tax credits? That is how jobs can be saved. In a small village of 2,000 or 3,000 people, a business that is given a boost of that nature could offer a competitive product, remain on the market and continue to create jobs.</ParaText><ParaText id="997339">No. The government decided that, at the end of the year, even with a very good national debt to GDP ratio, it would pay down the debt with the $10 billion surplus. This was of no help at all to the local economies of our communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="997340">In the medium term, we absolutely must put an end to this practice. The government must understand that it is not the right thing to do. If the government continues to head for disaster, all opposition parties must derail it and fight it in this House, go to the polls and ask the citizens of Quebec and Canada what kind of government they want. Do they want a government that will help them to build prosperity or a government that considers itself to be a spectator and takes no responsibility for organizing society in order to create this wealth?

Joseph Volpe (Eglinton—Lawrence, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="997349">Mr. Speaker, every now and then in the House members of Parliament get an opportunity to discuss issues that are important in the whole context of nation building. Sometimes those issues are prompted by initiatives of government, as they should be. After all, we all aspire to be elected so that we can fulfill an ambition to build this country, to make it greater and to leave a legacy for others to relish in and build from.</ParaText><ParaText id="997350">Those are the good things that we often cheapen by pure partisanship but they are there nonetheless. They are the bulwarks upon which we build a great society, a society that is the envy still of the entire world. Then there are other occasions when we are engaged in defending some of those ties that bind this country together precisely because the government attempts, either deliberately or perhaps subconsciously or indifferently, to weaken them.</ParaText><ParaText id="997351">Today we have a debate that is designed to re-strengthen some of the ties that the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> has, regrettably, engaged in ripping apart. I say “ripping apart” because it is exactly what some of the statements and comments by the minister have done with respect to Canada's most populous and most important industrial province. That is what the government has accomplished. It has taken the heart and soul of the province and the entrepreneurialship of its people and said, “No, this is not the way we should be running Canada's most important province”.</ParaText><ParaText id="997352">As another member said earlier, if the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> wants to run the province of Ontario he is welcome to abandon his seat and seek election in the province. Why am I excited about this, some members opposite would ask. It is very easy. </ParaText><ParaText id="997353">Today we have an example of the province of Ontario doing what it can in order to reverse some decisions being made by one of the bulwarks of the manufacturing sector in Canada, by making an investment of $17 million with one of the partners in the automobile sector that has been operating in this country for well over 100 years. Its head office might be in Detroit but it has been operating in Canada for 104 years. </ParaText><ParaText id="997354">What did it do? It made a strategic decision globally, as many companies do, in the interests of all of its shareholders, of all of the people who work for it and all of its consumers. It said that it would close engine plants in Windsor and Essex, plants that employ some 800-plus people in high technology, highly educated people with high paying types of jobs, jobs that have an impact in the creation of a minimum of at least another two and, more likely than not, another four as a result of its activity. More important, it maintains the educational infrastructure that makes innovation and technology possible in Canada, that makes the educational infrastructure the driving force behind the expansion of an economic engine that is Ontario.</ParaText><ParaText id="997355">What did the province do? It said that because the Government of Canada was reluctant in Ontario to promote the interests of the province and its industries, it would make a contribution of only $17 million because it said that it would come in with 10% of the requirement possible if Ford would only change a mandate.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp><ParaText id="997356">Ford closed 16 plants around the world. This was the first time that an automobile company, an assembler, a generator of research and development, changed its mandate in order to accommodate what the provincial government wanted it to do. The company did not do it all. The company said that many states in the United States were looking for this technology, looking for this activity and looking to build an infrastructure for manufacturing and education, and those states would do it.</ParaText><ParaText id="997357">Some members opposite think that the only thing that will drive these companies is lower taxes. Sometimes that works, especially when those companies are trying to build up the physical infrastructure, the educational infrastructure and the human resources training infrastructure required in order to bring that kind of activity into their midst.</ParaText><ParaText id="997358">My colleague from Quebec lamented the fact that there were some decisions by the automobile sector and the manufacturing sector that abandoned Quebec. I think in terms of Hyundai that a few years ago pulled out of Quebec because it complained about the kinds of infrastructure, education and training that was available to it. Where did Hyundai go? It made a $1.4 billion investment in Tennessee. Why? Tennessee is spending gazillions of dollars in order to build the kind of infrastructure that we already have here in Ontario.</ParaText><ParaText id="997359">The <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> said that the only thing that should be done in Ontario would be to cut taxes. All he needed to do was find the rounding error in order to come up with the same amount of money for those plants in Windsor and in Essex that would get people back to work and would generate the kind of educational research and training that could result from that kind of activity to ensure that the manufacturing sector in southwestern Ontario would remain healthy. We do not make investments only when times are good. We make investments like this for a generation down the road.</ParaText><ParaText id="997360">The automobile sector is important for southern Ontario and for Ontario in general. There are 350,000 direct and indirect jobs created by that sector, which means 350,000 families are dependent on that sector for vitality, for their future. Only eight cities in all of Canada are bigger than that number. If I include the members in those families who are dependent upon those 350,000 jobs, that gives me a population greater than every single province in Atlantic Canada and almost greater than Manitoba and Saskatchewan.</ParaText><ParaText id="997361">That is the kind of population base that the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and his government are ignoring and depreciating by simply saying that the only thing that will work is tax cuts. If tax cuts were part of the investment, I would say it is part of the solution, but that is not what is involved here. One needs to make the kinds of investment in infrastructure that will make things work for tomorrow. Generational decisions will be made in the next little while by those big drivers in the manufacturing sector.</ParaText><ParaText id="997362">It is not just the automobile sector or the auto parts sector. It is the physical infrastructure. We need to ensure that we can get goods from point A to point B without great difficulty. It means as well that CBSA needs to ensure that the border crossings work properly. </ParaText><ParaText id="997363">It is no longer credible for the government to say that we created all these problems. The Conservatives have been in government for two years and what have they done? What has the government done in two years to enhance the economic vitality of Ontario which has been the mainstay of Canadian wealth and health? </ParaText><ParaText id="997364">Over the course of the last two years, the minister has said that Ontario is in bad shape. He said that it used to be responsible for 41.2% of the economic welfare of Canada and now it has dropped down to 38.4%. He said that with great pride. He is in government. What did he do while all of this erosion was taking place?</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp><ParaText id="997365">I am looking at CAW, Ford, General Motors and Chrysler. They are beginning to sit down at the table to resolve the problems associated with an appreciating dollar and much more expensive human resources costs for the manufacturing sector. They can get along. Why can the federal government not get along with its provincial counterpart? Why can it not build a partnership that is required to build for tomorrow, to generate an investment in our province that will translate into benefits around the country? We know that to be the case. </ParaText><ParaText id="997366">Seventeen thousand Ontarians left Ontario to seek work elsewhere in Canada and they took their families with them. Ten thousand of those were people who had a university degree or better. Do we know what that means when we lose that kind of a resource? </ParaText><ParaText id="997367">It is useless to hear the <Affiliation DbId="105827" Type="4">Minister of Human Resources and Social Development</Affiliation> crow about all of the investments the government has made. It has not made any. It cannot. It forgot to tell everyone that all of the labour market development agreements have already been signed with the provinces and what have the provinces been doing with that money. What have they been doing in the last two years? Has the minister asked? He has not told the House. Has he given us an indication of what those 10,000 people with university credentials who have left Ontario means? </ParaText><ParaText id="997368">It means a loss of $1.6 million of investment that the province of Ontario has already made in educating those people. It means that we have lost a critical mass of creative thinkers and experienced people. It means that we have transferred wealth generators from Ontario into other parts of the country. That may all be well and good provided it was a strategic decision on the part of the Government of Canada to ensure that there was a development of that kind of wealth creator and wealth generator in one province and then to ship them to some place else in order to bring greater wealth and benefit to Canadians at large. </ParaText><ParaText id="997369">Those were decisions that were made by individuals in part and maybe entirely because the government has not done what it could have done by way of investing in the proverbial creator of wealth that is Ontario.</ParaText><ParaText id="997370">I know what will happen as the members opposite get into this question. They will want to know what we did when we were there. I guess, rather than give a litany of all of those items, I will do them all. I am going to refer members to my website where they will see all our record in terms of human resources. I will also talk about immigration in a moment and what we did in terms of investment in the industrial sector. The question here is whether the government has a strategy that goes beyond parroting a very simple phrase, tax cuts.</ParaText><ParaText id="997371">I saw the numbers that the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> gave us, $60 billion in the last two years. If he takes a look at what he got for the cuts that he says exists, I would like to see them. He cannot generate them. He cannot say what those tax cuts resulted in other than a declining economy in Ontario, other than a declining economy in Quebec, other than a transfer of population from Atlantic Canada over to Alberta primarily, secondarily to British Columbia and now, thank heavens, even Saskatchewan. He cannot give us those facts. He refuses to give us those because in part those facts do not exist.</ParaText><ParaText id="997372">What is his demographic policy? He has the <Affiliation DbId="105834" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship and Immigration</Affiliation> giving him some tidbits to throw into the budget document so that we can talk about demographic movement. What are we talking about? It is about reducing a waiting list. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp><ParaText id="997373">In an environment that sees fewer and fewer people landing in Canada, the minister is talking about reducing a waiting list, as if that were the demographic, the strategic policy for bringing wealth creators into the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="997374"> I have news for him. He should read the document. The 350,000 people who came here between 2001 and 2006 had a university degree or better. It would take our country $50 billion and 22 years to generate the same kind of talent. We did it all in the space of five years. Of all of those men and women who came to this country between 2001 and 2006, between the ages of 25 and 64, the most productive years of their lives, 51% already had a university degree or better. </ParaText><ParaText id="997375">The shame of all that is 23% of native born Canadians have the same qualifications. It is scandalous because it speaks to the government's inability and unwillingness to invest in the creation of a true human resources potential for unlocking the wealth of this nation.</ParaText><ParaText id="997376">I heard one of the members opposite say that we did not recognize their credentials. How do we recognize their credentials by eliminating the backlog? Does that improve their chances of getting jobs? We have a pool of 350,000 people who have a university degree or better and this is what the Conservatives have come up with. </ParaText><ParaText id="997377">Of those 350,000, 25%, or roughly 70,000 men and women, have an engineering degree. Countries like China, India, Brazil, South Africa, Russia are trying to generate wealth by getting more and more of their people to study engineering, the applied math and the applied sciences. We have them, 70,000. </ParaText><ParaText id="997378">Now the minister says that under the budget document they want to ensure that they do not get any more of them. The Conservatives want to go ahead and eliminate the backlog. As the member opposite said, there are too many people here who are not working and that we should invest in ensuring they get the kind of jobs that we would want.</ParaText><ParaText id="997379">We made a decision in that regard, already $88 million to go into enhanced language training. What that means is we are making an investment in the kind of language that is used on the job, the language of mathematicians, of engineers, of scientists, of medical practitioners. We should make an investment in bringing on side all those sectors and professional organizations that are encouraged then to utilize the talent they have to wait tens of years to develop.</ParaText><ParaText id="997380">We do not see any of that in the budget. We see instead the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> ridiculing a province because it is actually making efforts to integrate that wealth generated, that demographic talent into the economic engine and the economic activity of the province. I do not know whether that is good government. I know for sure it is not good nation building.</ParaText><ParaText id="997381">Rather than be partisan, I encourage the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> to come up with the kind of strategy that utilizes the talent that is there and to build on that, to expand that talent. Most important, I ask him to do what I can tell him is difficult, but it is still realizable, and that is to build a partnership with willing jurisdictions. </ParaText><ParaText id="997382">The province of Ontario is a willing jurisdiction. It has been the mainstay of Confederation since its inception. It is not productive to engage in partisanship with a jurisdiction that is willing to be a nation builder.

Complemented by a Conservative government that is committed to creating a business climate where Canadians can succeed and prosper, we are confident that the challenges of today will prove merely to be the path of the opportunities of tomorrow.</ParaText><ParaText id="997414">To achieve such, our Conservative government is committed to working cooperatively with all provinces and territories. This is in stark contrast to the federal Liberal opposition, whose time in government was largely marred by unparalleled acrimonious relations with the provinces. From that record of unprecedented cuts to federal transfer payments to the near loss of the 1995 Quebec referendum, to the lowering of Canadian flags and the appalling and repeated denial of a fiscal imbalance, this Conservative government has absolutely nothing to learn from the official opposition when it comes to federal-provincial relations.</ParaText><ParaText id="997415">Our record of strong support is in deeds, not in words or empty rhetoric. I would like to take a moment to look at these deeds for the benefit of the opposition.</ParaText><ParaText id="997416">First, this Conservative government has brought total transfers to all provinces and territories to historic highs following the unprecedented transfer reductions introduced by the former Liberal government.</ParaText><ParaText id="997417">Second, budget 2007 restored fiscal balance and did so in a manner that is fair to all provinces and territories--what the Liberal leader still arrogantly dismisses as a myth. The budget strengthened federal support to the provinces by over $39 billion for shared priorities, including equalization, post-secondary education, social programs, support for children, labour market training, infrastructure, and the environment.</ParaText><ParaText id="997418">Provinces have also benefited from the 2007 budget's new equalization system, which returns the system to a fair and principled basis and helps ensure that all provinces have the resources to provide reasonably comparable programs and services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation.</ParaText><ParaText id="997419">Third, to complement these increases to equalization, we also moved to ensure that the Canada social transfer and the Canada health transfer treat all Canadians fairly by moving to equal per capita cash support, eliminating the past situation under the previous government whereby Ontario got a proportionately less than per capita transfer, something known as back door equalization.</ParaText><ParaText id="997420">Ontario's Liberal premier called on the former Liberal government to remedy this situation. It did not. Its solution? Deny it existed and send out the member for <Affiliation DbId="78387" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation>, the very sponsor of today's motion, to claim its provincial Liberal cousins were aiding and abetting Quebec separatists for even daring to raise the issue in 2005. It was scandalous.</ParaText><ParaText id="997421">In sharp contrast, this Conservative government acted in the best interests of fairness, and we resolved Ontario's concerns.</ParaText><ParaText id="997422">Our new equalization system responds to other concerns raised by Ontario by guaranteeing that equalization transfers are capped at the level of the lowest non-receiving province, which is Ontario. This means, in effect, that Ontario taxpayers will not be subsidizing provinces with a higher fiscal capacity than theirs. All provinces and territories are benefiting from this significantly increased, more equitable and more principles-based transfer support.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp><ParaText id="997423">As a result of restoring fiscal balance in Ontario, Ontario will receive $13.9 billion in 2008-09, an increase of $1.4 billion from just last year, and more than $2.7 billion since 2005-06, the last year of the Liberal administration.</ParaText><ParaText id="997424">That does not mean our work is done.</ParaText><ParaText id="997425"> We believe that to secure Canada's and Ontario's economic future we must become one of the most competitive business tax regimes in the world. This Conservative government has made enormous strides in this regard. </ParaText><ParaText id="997426">Anticipating current economic volatility, we took aggressive action in the fall of 2007 to stimulate and bolster the economy with more than $60 billion in tax cuts. We cut corporate income taxes. We cut personal income taxes. And we cut the GST, just as we promised.</ParaText><ParaText id="997427">Combined with prior measures, the total actions taken by this government to date are approaching $200 billion in tax cuts over this and the next five years. These actions will bring Canada's federal taxes to their lowest level in nearly half a century. In the coming year alone, we will have provided $21 billion in tax relief, roughly 1.4% of Canada's total economy. </ParaText><ParaText id="997428">Observers have been widespread in their praise for our Conservative government's pre-emptive action, such as BMO economic Doug Porter, who stated of the fall economic statement that:</ParaText><ParaText id="997429"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">It was brilliantly timed.

This will make Canada's corporate income tax rate the lowest among the world's major developed economies and give Canada a substantial tax advantage over the United States.</ParaText><ParaText id="997436">Along with a reduction in the corporate income tax, we have also eliminated the corporate surtax for all corporations. We have eliminated the federal capital tax two years ahead of schedule. We have provided an incentive to encourage provinces to eliminate their capital taxes, which Ontario did in its most recent budget. We have reduced the small business tax rate to 11% ahead of schedule. We have increased the small business tax limit from $300,000 to $400,000. This is job-creating stuff.</ParaText><ParaText id="997437">This competitive tax regime will be a powerful brand for Canada globally, but we cannot do it alone. We need the provinces to follow suit, especially Ontario, the province most out of line compared with other provinces in areas that matter most.</ParaText><ParaText id="997438">For example, in 2012, Ontario's marginal effective tax rate will be 30.7%, one of the highest in the country and well above Quebec's marginal effective tax rate of 18.8% in 2012. That is substantial. The federal tax system accounts for only one-third of Ontario's marginal effective tax rate, with Ontario's taxes responsible for two-thirds. </ParaText><ParaText id="997439">For those who would question the words of a Conservative politician on this matter, I ask them to consider the words of the Province of Ontario's very own task force on competitiveness, which in 2007 reported the following:</ParaText><ParaText id="997440"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Combining a relatively high provincial corporate income tax, a capital tax, and a sales tax on capital goods, Ontario has the highest tax rate on new business investment among the provinces...Ontario's tax regime is one of the least conducive to business investment in the developed world.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="997441"> I want to repeat that.

Canada's economic fundamentals are solid. We are the only G-7 country not running a deficit. We have reduced the federal debt by $37 billion. We have had over a decade of sustained economic growth. Inflation remains low and unemployment is near its lowest level in 30 years.</ParaText><ParaText id="997457">However, there are clearly some sectors that are not benefiting from today's prosperity largely due to variables beyond our control, indeed beyond our own borders.</ParaText><ParaText id="997458">A volatile global economy, a weakening U.S. export market, the strength of the Canadian dollar against a weak U.S. dollar, high energy prices along with fierce competition from emerging economies like Brazil, China and India, have left several sectors located in Ontario struggling.</ParaText><ParaText id="997459">Canada's manufacturing heartland in Ontario has been negatively impacted with significant job losses. While we have seen job gains in other well-paying sectors to offset them, manufacturing job losses are nevertheless a concern.</ParaText><ParaText id="997460">Before continuing, I will note that the instability in the manufacturing sector is not a recent phenomenon but one that has been lingering well before our government came to power. As the United Steelworkers national director Ken Neumann recently observed, “The crisis didn't just start when the Conservatives took office...The Liberals had 12 years to deal with this stuff and they did nothing”.</ParaText><ParaText id="997461">Unlike the former Liberal government that ignored the plight of Ontario manufacturers, we have taken aggressive action to help create a more competitive and productive business environment, measures in the best interest of job creation, growth and investment.</ParaText><ParaText id="997462">For instance, we have provided tax relief in every way the government collects taxes that will total almost $200 billion. Yes, that is correct, $200 billion over this and the next five years, ensuring Canada's corporate taxes will become among the lowest in the major industrialized economies.</ParaText><ParaText id="997463">We are proud to note our actions have been roundly applauded by a wide range of organizations such as the Canadian Bankers Association who declared that this Conservative government “continues to take steps to establish a solid financial foundation that will allow Canada to generate further economic growth and remain competitive in a global economy”.</ParaText><ParaText id="997464">What is more, since 2006, over $9 billion of that tax relief will help the manufacturing sector meet current economic challenges and ensure their long term success, such as: reducing the corporate income tax rate in 2008, followed by ongoing reductions that will bring the tax rate down to 15% by 2012 from more than 22%; introducing a temporary accelerated capital cost allowance for investment in manufacturing and processing machinery and equipment that will provide $1.75 billion of assistance to the manufacturing sector; increasing the capital cost allowance rate to 10% for buildings used in manufacturing and processing and to 55% for computers; eliminating the corporate surtax for all corporations; eliminating the federal capital tax; reducing the small business income tax rate to 11%; providing greater accessibility to the enhanced scientific research and experimental development tax incentive program, while also improving administration of the program.</ParaText><ParaText id="997465">We are also providing more direct support to help the manufacturing sector and affected workers adjust to ongoing challenges: for the automotive sector a $250 million automotive innovation fund to support large scale research and development projects to develop innovative, greener and more fuel efficient vehicles, thereby helping our automotive industry to maintain its leadership position.</ParaText><ParaText id="997466">In addition to the automotive innovation fund, we have provided substantial funding for an access road to the new Windsor-Detroit border crossing to promote E85 fuel commercialization along with an enhanced EDC export guarantee program to increase guaranteed coverage to 90%.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp><ParaText id="997467">I note such measures, all contained in budget 2008, have been very well received by the sector. General Motors of Canada praised them remarking, “Directionally it's very, very positive...they've really shown they're listening and they're moving forward”.</ParaText><ParaText id="997468">Leading industry analyst Dennis DesRosiers highly commended them, stating that together with previous budgets they revealed that the feds actually dedicated a significant amount of resources and political capital to the automotive sector and that, for the most part, this government was taking a proactive and positive approach to helping this industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="997469">We have also undertaken similarly targeted measures to assess the forestry sector. For instance, we are investing $127.5 million in the forestry industry's long term competitive initiative to support innovation and assist the forestry sector to shift toward higher value products to tap into new markets.</ParaText><ParaText id="997470">We have established a $25 million forest communities program that will assist 11 forest-based communities to make informed decisions on the forest land base.</ParaText><ParaText id="997471">We are also providing $10 million over two years to Natural Resources Canada to promote the forestry sector in international markets.</ParaText><ParaText id="997472">As Avrim Lazar of the Forest Products Association of Canada recently attested to during a recent appearance at the finance committee, when it comes to the forestry sector this Conservative government “--has done many positive things in the past and we're looking forward to many positive things in the future”.</ParaText><ParaText id="997473">While the previously mentioned examples of targeted support will help sectors generally, we also recognize that workers and communities affected by a changing global economic landscape also need assistance.</ParaText><ParaText id="997474">That is why we are simultaneously putting in place measures like the targeted initiative for older workers, a program that supports provinces in helping unemployed older workers who live in vulnerable communities stay in the workplace, a program we extended in 2012 in budget 2008 with $90 million in funding.</ParaText><ParaText id="997475">Similarly, we have also introduced a $1 billion community development trust to provide provincial government support to assist communities and workers affected by global economic instability. Ontario will receive $358 million under this trust.</ParaText><ParaText id="997476">I will point out that Ontario has already committed all of that federal funding for programs to support workers and communities in agriculture, forestry, and manufacturing, including the automotive sector, for initiatives such as new, up-to-date skills training for unemployed Ontario workers, including those communities in northwestern Ontario that have been hard hit by layoffs in the forestry sector.</ParaText><ParaText id="997477">Ontario's Liberal Premier Dalton McGuinty has expressed his appreciation to our Conservative government for working cooperatively with his government to help Ontario adjust to new global economic challenges, stating the trust was “--good for the people of Ontario.

Economists and business leaders have been at the forefront of this charge. </ParaText><ParaText id="997484">As I conclude, I am actually rather surprised that the sponsor of today's motion and his Liberal colleagues, alleged proponents of lower corporate taxation, are now suggesting that the calls for lower corporate taxation in Ontario by the federal <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> are somehow wrong.</ParaText><ParaText id="997485">Consider the Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="78821" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation> who has stated, “There is no better tax reform in terms of its ability to attract investment and improve productivity, prosperity and the standard of living than corporate tax reform”.</ParaText><ParaText id="997486">Consider the leader of the Liberal Party who has proclaimed, “A low corporate tax rate is not a right wing policy or a left wing policy.

My question back to the hon. member is, does he disagree with his own leader?</ParaText><ParaText id="997493">The challenge we have is that when the Liberals are in government, they are doing one thing and when they are in opposition, they are talking exactly the opposite way. It creates a lot of confusion among the voters. The Liberals talk about how important tax cuts are on one hand and in the next moment when we cut taxes, they say that maybe it is not the right way to handle it.</ParaText><ParaText id="997494">Canadians would like to know exactly where the Liberals stand.

Shawn Murphy (Charlottetown, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="997500">Mr. Speaker, as I said in my last question, I am sure that people watching this debate on TV are thinking that this is a very bizarre situation we are dealing with in the House of Commons today. </ParaText><ParaText id="997501">The federal government, led by the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, has made a full frontal attack on the province of Ontario and the workers, families and people who live in that province. The premier has been called the small man of Confederation. The <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> has stated publicly that the province of Ontario should be the last province in which a person would look to invest.</ParaText><ParaText id="997502">I pointed out previously in my question the history of the Conservative Party in dealing with debt. There are younger members who do not recall the situation that we went through back in 1993. The annual deficit was $43 billion, and that was annual, not accumulated. Interest rates were in the 11% to 12% range. Unemployment was over 10%. The debt to GDP ratio was 73%. The World Bank had an active file on this country. In other words, we were probably minutes from bankruptcy. </ParaText><ParaText id="997503">The right monetary and fiscal policy was implemented and thankfully, things were turned around. I am not going to go over the statistics on that particular issue, but another thing happened too, when the present <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> became the minister of finance for the province of Ontario. His government left an annual deficit of $5.6 billion.</ParaText><ParaText id="997504">We are all left asking ourselves, what policies, programs and initiatives led to the Conservative Government of Canada having an annual deficit of $43 billion? What policies, programs and initiatives led to the province of Ontario having an annual deficit of $5.6 billion? Does anyone in this assembly or in Canada know the answer to those particular questions?</ParaText><ParaText id="997505">It was an unfortunate time for the people living in Canada back in 1993. I recall it vividly. It was an unfortunate time for the people living in Ontario at the end of the Michael Harris Conservative government era. Thankfully, that has been corrected also, so we do have a new era in this province, but we have this crazy attack by the federal government on the province of Ontario. </ParaText><ParaText id="997506">Everyone I talk to just shakes his or her head and asks what is going on in Ottawa. Why is the government doing that? What is it attempting to accomplish by attacking one of the provinces? People are asking, would it not be interesting if the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="105838" Type="96">government House leader</Affiliation> went to the province of Quebec and attempted a similar attack in that province?

Would it not be interesting if those parties went to the province of British Columbia and had a similar attack?</ParaText><ParaText id="997507">It is going on right here in Ottawa against the province of Ontario. I and a lot of people in this House, and a lot of people right across the country of Canada, are just shaking our heads, some in amusement, some in shock, and a lot in disappointment. It is certainly not the work of this House. We are just puzzled. I listened to the debate all day and I am trying to get some semblance of why this is going on. What is the purpose of it? What is behind it? What are we trying to accomplish by this attack on the people who live in the province of Ontario?</ParaText><ParaText id="997508">I listened to every word and all we are getting is a bunch of statistics that really do not go to why this is going on. I am still shaking my head as to why the government is attempting to do this.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp><ParaText id="997509"> A situation that I find equally bizarre is that not one Conservative member of Parliament elected by the people of Ontario will get up in this House and disassociate in any way with the remarks coming from the <Affiliation DbId="105838" Type="96">government House leader</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>. They are just given a bunch of statistics and prepared documents to read. The people watching this on TV, especially the people of Ontario, are saying, “Maybe the member is standing up for Canada, but we in this riding elected that member to go to Ottawa to represent us, to represent our interests, our businesses, our families, our workers. We did not send the member to Ottawa to read speeches prepared by the office of the Prime Minister”.</ParaText><ParaText id="997510"> If there are any Conservative members of Parliament from Ontario in this House, they should take the last few minutes of the debate to clarify their position. They should tell the people they represent that they do not associate in any way, shape or manner with those comments from the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, who I pointed out is a member of Parliament from the province of Ontario.

As I said, I do not live in Ontario, but I am shaking my head as to the nature of the attack that has been going on over the last four or five weeks.

I would like to remind members of the House and people who may be watching us tonight on television what is at issue here.</ParaText><ParaText id="997529">Between July 2001 and March 2006, Statistics Canada underestimated the consumer price index by one-tenth of one percentage point in each of those five years. This means that recipients of the old age security, Canada pension plan and the guaranteed income supplement were shortchanged on their cost of living adjustments for a period of five years. </ParaText><ParaText id="997530">When the error was discovered, the correctly calculated CPI was implemented but it was not implemented retroactively. Rather, it was implemented effective mid-2006. Seniors were never reimbursed for the intervening five years and therein lies the rub.</ParaText><ParaText id="997531">When I raised this question on a previous occasion, the parliamentary secretary to the minister acknowledged the mistake but said that the government was obliged to act based on published CPI data, even if those published data were wrong.

Should they not get a retroactive payment? It was not their fault. It was not the fault of the government department concerned. It was Statistics Canada's fault but it does not have that amount of money to pay out.</ParaText><ParaText id="997534">The government has acknowledged the error and corrected the current rates but so far it has dodged the issue. In fact, the government has continued to dodge the issue in question period, in correspondence and in response to petitions that I have tabled in the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="997535">The former minister of human resources and social development dodged the issue.

This is a tool that measures inflation and calculates pension benefits for seniors. Earlier this year, Statistics Canada corrected this error and the consumer price index continues to serve as Canada's best and most accurate tool to measure inflation.</ParaText><ParaText id="997541"> Like all western countries, Canada does not retroactively adjust the consumer price index. Retroactive adjustments to the consumer price index would result in administrative chaos. It would affect private and public pension plans, labour force agreements and many other agreements that use the CPI.</ParaText><ParaText id="997542">We know that the members of the NDP do not have to worry about the long term effects of their words because they will never form the government. However, we must worry about these effects.</ParaText>

Seniors know that actions speak louder than words. This is why this government acted quickly to support seniors issues. It is why within months of being elected this government introduced Bill <Document DbId="2521443" Type="3">C-36</Document> to strengthen the CPP and OAS programs for all seniors.</ParaText><ParaText id="997545">We have simplified the application process and changed the rules so that seniors do not have to apply year after year for the benefits that they deserve. These are changes which the previous Liberal government never made during its 13 years in power.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="997546">We have brought in two separate 3.5% increases to the GIS. These increases will raise the total GIS benefit by more than $2.7 billion over the next five years and will benefit more than 1.6 million guaranteed income supplement recipients, including more than 50,000 seniors who were not eligible for the program under the previous Liberal government. </ParaText><ParaText id="997547">This is a record of action of which this government is very proud.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

According to a briefing note prepared for the Secretary of State for Seniors that I received through an access to information request, the impact of the revision that I am asking about would be “billions of dollars in the public and private sectors”.

It so happens that tomorrow is the start of the next shrimp season. Depending on the ice, this can be changed, but the official date is tomorrow, April 1.<Sup></Sup></ParaText><ParaText id="997556">When I asked the <Affiliation DbId="78754" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries and Oceans</Affiliation> my question in February, I reminded him of the utter lack of an action plan for the fisheries. Allow me to explain. The answer I got was quite vague. It seemed as through the minister was saying that he was dancing the tango with Quebec minister Laurent Lessard, that everything was going well and that there would be good news in the weeks to come. It is now March 31. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="997557">As I mentioned, the fishing season begins tomorrow. Unfortunately, we are still at square one, waiting for a concrete action plan that should be in place to help fishers during a season which, each year, is marked by rather difficult conditions. We know that negotiations have taken place between processors and fishers. One might say that, this year, these negotiations seem a little more positive. In any case, it is definitely not because of the cooperation shown by the minister of Fisheries and Oceans, or his department. </ParaText><ParaText id="997558">In the end, we find ourselves in a situation where it would take very little to provide greater assistance to those hundreds of people who are wondering whether they will be able to work at the processing plant, or go shrimp fishing. An action plan for the whole fisheries sector would have a much broader scope, but let us deal strictly with the shrimp fishery. It is totally abnormal, illogical and irresponsible to wait until just a few hours, or even a few days, before the beginning of a fishing season to tell people about the action that will be taken. Why did the government not do it earlier? </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="997559">I had the opportunity to raise this question in February, and I also had the opportunity to raise other ones on the same issue as soon as the last shrimp fishing season ended last year, in 2007. That is why it was important to get back to it. A forum on fisheries was held in Quebec, in November 2006, and we are still without an action plan. Such is the current situation: I have no action plan from the federal Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. April 2008 is just around the corner, and there is still no action plan from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans regarding a sector that comes under its responsibility, namely fisheries. </ParaText><ParaText id="997560">Quebec has been completely abandoned by this minister, or this department, regarding very simple issues such as that of shrimp fishing. We could of course raise other issues because, unfortunately, in the fisheries sector it is just one crisis after the other, and it is extremely difficult to accept the fact that nothing is being done in this case.</ParaText><ParaText id="997561">In November 2006, the minister came before all the stakeholders in the fisheries sector and said—which was disappointing at the time—that he was there first and foremost to listen, while these people were waiting for very concrete measures regarding the 2007 season. Today, we are getting ready for the 2008 season, and there is still no action plan.</ParaText><ParaText id="997562">That is why I would say that in—</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

In response to the member, let me focus on the ocean to plate approach we are taking as they pertain to the main themes of Quebec's action plan. </ParaText><ParaText id="997570">Let me mention three things, which all start with “c”.</ParaText><ParaText id="997571"> The first is competitiveness. In the harvesting sector our government has strengthened and implemented a policy to protect the independence of inshore fishing fleets in Atlantic Canada by phasing out controlling trust agreements. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="997572">The department is committed to working with industry to change licensing policies in order to allow fish harvesters to hold more than one licence or to combine enterprises. Fisheries and Oceans Canada is also working to give traditional lending institutions more confidence in providing access to capital for fish harvesters. </ParaText><ParaText id="997573">The minister has also launched a commercial licence fee review to assess the cost on harvesters. In the short term, department officials are reviewing licence fee relief requests for shrimpers in Quebec.</ParaText><ParaText id="997574">In terms of regional shares, measures are in place for cod and halibut and we are currently working on seals and other species. The department is actively working with its provincial colleagues to develop a sustainable aquaculture industry in Quebec as well as the rest of Atlantic Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="997575">The second is commercialization. Building on the ocean to plate approach, we recognize the importance of market awareness as it relates to the Canadian fishing industry. The department has taken on a facilitative role in working with our federal partners such as Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Foreign Affairs, International Trade Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to ensure the industry remains competitive abroad.</ParaText><ParaText id="997576">DFO is participating in the federal-provincial-territorial marketing working group, which is chaired by Quebec. DFO has also supported and participated in ocean to plate sessions on lobster, snow crab and cold water shrimp. These meetings involved participants from all along the seafood value chain and identified key market challenges and opportunities.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="997577">Critical to market access is the eco-labelling or certification under international standards. DFO is responding to this on a number of fronts, including fisheries sustainability check lists, contributing to marine stewardship council, certification process and a number of ways.</ParaText><ParaText id="997578">Finally, is consensus building and recognition. We are strongly in support of this priority and Quebec's action plan and will continue to support it.

As we all know, we do not always get answers. My question had to do with ethics and with what is now known as the Cadman affair.</ParaText><ParaText id="997585">The situation is most alarming and very serious. Let us review what happened. In 2005, there were a number of crucial votes. Canada had not had a minority government in years. Bills were put to the vote. We all remember the late Chuck Cadman, who was the member for his Vancouver area riding. Despite the fact that he was seriously ill, he decided to come to the House to vote and carry out his duties as a member of Parliament.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="997586">However, we later found out that what happened was far less noble, particularly on the part of a government that claims to be transparent and pure as the driven snow. In the last federal election, the Conservatives said that they had never done anything wrong and never would. However, some of the things the government tried to do were certainly disturbing. The people of Canada found it disturbing. I think I will have a hard time getting clear answers, because there is a tape that proves what the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said to a reporter not so very long ago.</ParaText><ParaText id="997587">Clearly, as I said earlier, there is more going on than the Cadman affair.

And that's not all. There was also the “in and out” scheme with Elections Canada.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="997588">It is clear and plain that we have here a government which refuses to be transparent; it tries to control everything and hide things from the people of Canada. In addition, the allegations made in the Cadman affair about discussions the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> apparently had concerning a “financial consideration” are alarming.
