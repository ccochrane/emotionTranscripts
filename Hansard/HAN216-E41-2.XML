An Act to amend the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act (Sambro Island Lighthouse)</SubjectOfBusinessTitle><SubjectOfBusinessContent><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Leslie" id="8705522"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170380" Type="2">Ms. Megan Leslie (Halifax, NDP) </Affiliation>
						</PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4121283"> moved that Bill <Document DbId="6495738" Type="4">C-588, An Act to amend the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act (Sambro Island Lighthouse)</Document>, be read the second time and referred to a committee. </ParaText><ProceduralText TocType="TPC" id="1">Bill C-588. Second reading</ProceduralText><ParaText id="4121284"> She said: Mr. Speaker, this past year, one day before Remembrance Day, November 10, 2014, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170509" Type="2">Sackville—Eastern Shore</Affiliation> and I held a press conference about a lighthouse and its link to Remembrance Day. With us was veteran Earl Corn. Mr. Corn is a retired sailor of 38 years, and he talked about how the light from the Sambro Island Lighthouse was so important to Canada's men and women serving in the military. As Mr. Corn stated, “This was the last thing we saw [leaving port], and the first thing we saw arriving home.... It's probably one of the most important pieces of real estate we have”.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121285">Also at our press conference was George Zwaagstra, who immigrated to Canada in the 1950s. Mr. Zwaagstra told us a heartwarming story of immigrating to Canada by boat, crammed together with others who were seeking a new life in Canada, and how they spent a couple of weeks in rough seas. He told us about one passenger who suffered a horrible case of seasickness, and how after days and days of no relief this man begged his friends to help him. He said he did not think he could go on being on the ship. That is when someone saw a light on the horizon, a small pinprick of light. It would probably not be very interesting to us, but news of that light spread across the ship in an instant. Mr. Zwaagstra and others went below and found the poor man with seasickness who felt he could not go on, and they hauled him to the deck above to see that light. That light was the first that they saw of Canada, and that light was from the Sambro Island lighthouse.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121286">People have called the Sambro Island lighthouse Canada's Statue of Liberty. It was the first light that newcomers arriving by boat could see. They saw that light before they even saw land. As we heard from Mr. Corn, that light was not only the first light that new immigrants saw, but it was the last light that Canadians saw when they went off to war. For those who paid the ultimate sacrifice and did not return, sometimes it was the last memory that they had of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121287">Those stories demonstrate how important this lighthouse is. That light is a part of our history, yet it continues to shine today. The Sambro Island lighthouse is an iconic structure. In fact, at a recent funding announcement to repair the lighthouse, the <Affiliation DbId="194629" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> called this lighthouse one of the most iconic structures, not only in Nova Scotia but across the country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121288">This iconic lighthouse, Canada's Statue of Liberty, is at risk. A number of years ago, the government embarked on a community consultation to draft a new piece of legislation that would be called the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act. This was a very good consultation process. I have talked to people in Nova Scotia who were part of this process, and they were proud to be a part of it. After a period of robust consultation, the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act was written and it passed through Parliament. Those in the Nova Scotia lighthouse preservation community felt a real sense of accomplishment, that they were a part of something good that would preserve and protect our lighthouses.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121289">Then, in 2010, in the old bait and switch, the federal government made an announcement. Conservatives announced that since lighthouses were not really used as navigational aids anymore, lighthouses across the country would be declared surplus. They were delisted. Essentially, government would not take care of them anymore.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121290">In the lighthouse protection community, there was an incredible feeling of betrayal. There was all of this work to save our lighthouses, and then the government announced in 2010 that 976 lighthouses across Canada were surplus. In the words of Barry MacDonald, then president of the Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society:</ParaText><ParaText id="4121291"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">I'm very, very disappointed. Although the aid to navigation that's on that location is not declared surplus, what they're coming at here is the fact that they can maintain a steel tower on that site with a solar light a whole lot cheaper than they can maintain a heritage structure.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4121292">The 976 lighthouses across Canada were declared surplus, and Sambro Island lighthouse was on that list. Once a lighthouse is delisted, the community does have an option to take over that lighthouse. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121293">However, under the new Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act, the public was given two years to petition and to nominate historic lighthouses. In order to qualify for this designation, the group or an individual had to submit a business plan for its upkeep. We have seen this happen in different communities across Canada where communities have applied to take over their local lighthouse.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121294">Shortly after the announcement in 2010, I met with members of the Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society to talk about options. We discussed this option: Could we rally the community to come together to take over this lighthouse?</ParaText><ParaText id="4121295">A community group began the heritage designation process. However, it does not have the resources required to maintain this structure, not to mention the fact that trust has been lost. Why would they engage with a process when they had spent years in a process that only led to their community lighthouse being put at risk? Trust was lost.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121296">Also, in the case of the Sambro Island lighthouse, which stands roughly 24 metres tall, the lighthouse is located on a granite island at the entrance to Halifax Harbour. It is not as easily accessed as if it were on land or located on the end of a pier.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121297">Second, the financial cost associated with maintaining the structure is very high. For example, in 2008, when the Coast Guard repainted the lighthouse, it had to use a helicopter to ferry in supplies, including a large web of scaffolding. The total cost came in at about $80,000 for a simple repainting.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121298">It is not possible for the community to take over this lighthouse. The Sambro Island lighthouse is not on a pier or a wharf. It is not on the shores of Sambro or on Crystal Crescent Beach. It is on an island: essentially a piece of rock in the ocean.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121299"> Sue Paul, secretary for the Sambro Island Lighthouse Heritage Society put it well:</ParaText><ParaText id="4121300"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> This is on an island. It's not easy to get to. It's also an 80-foot tower. It's not something that you can just put painting scaffolding on to do a quick fix-up.... It requires more work than our community can give it safely. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4121301">The community is not able to take care of this lighthouse. It is dangerous. It is not easy to get to. Every summer, there is a community celebration called Sou' Wester Days. Boat tours are organized to the island, and I cannot tell members how many of those tours have been cancelled due to rain, fog, wind, big swells. It is not like it is a hop, skip, and jump.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121302">When I met with the Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society members in 2010, another thing was apparent. They were tired. They had put all of these resources into a consultation process and no one had any energy left. Eventually the two-year time for the community to register its intent to take over that lighthouse passed by.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121303">In 2013, the local community in Sambro started to organize. It started as a meeting of friends, including Sue Paul, Stephanie Smith, and Brendan McGuire, who would later go on to represent this area as MLA. They came together and talked about one goal: to save the Sambro lighthouse. In October 2013, they established the not-for-profit organization called Sambro Island Lighthouse Heritage Society, and relied heavily upon Barry MacDonald for his expertise on lighthouses and working with government.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121304">Barry mentored this group, and the group grew in size and determination. They put together a petition and asked people to sign if they supported saving the Sambro Island lighthouse. With 5,000 signatures from across Canada, they asked MPs to present those petitions in Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121305">Working with this group of citizens, we came up with a solution. If Parks Canada took over responsibility for this park, actually took it away from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans or the Coast Guard, we could preserve this lighthouse and piece of our history.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121306">That is what we did. Working with community and the wonderful legislative drafters at the House of Commons, I was able to put together Bill <Document DbId="6495738" Type="4">C-588, an act to amend the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act (Sambro Island lighthouse)</Document>. With the passing of the act, we could save the Sambro Island lighthouse and this piece of our history.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121307">Why should Parks Canada take over the lighthouse? Let me tell members some of the historical facts about the lighthouse.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4121308">It was built during the Seven Years' War, in 1758, by the first act passed in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly. That was the first bill passed in our legislature in Nova Scotia. It was about this lighthouse. It is the oldest operational lighthouse in the Americas, and the federal government has already recognized the historic significance of this structure.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121309">In 1937, Sambro lighthouse was designated as a national historic site and a plaque was placed in the village of Sambro. The construction of this lighthouse was also commemorated as a national historic event in 1937. </ParaText><ParaText id="4121310">In 1996, the lighthouse received federal heritage review board classified status, which is the highest-ranking status for Canadian government heritage buildings. The heritage character of the Sambro Island lighthouse was described in the Parks Canada website of federal heritage designations as the following:</ParaText><ParaText id="4121311"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">One of the most historically important lighthouses in Canada due to its age and its association with Halifax Harbour's marine traffic for over 235 years, this stone and concrete tower is considered the oldest operating lighthouse in North America.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121312">Recently I attended a funding announcement with the <Affiliation DbId="194629" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="170590" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margaret's</Affiliation>, who announced $1.5 million to go toward the repair of this lighthouse. This is our chance to fix the lighthouse and restore it to its former glory, and then preserve and protect it for generations to come. Why spend $1.5 million to prevent this lighthouse from tumbling into the sea now, only to have it tumble into the sea 40 years from now? We need to act to protect this lighthouse.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121313">In my last few minutes, I would like to thank some people. I do recognize that if one starts a list of thanks, one is bound to forget someone, but I will take that risk because there are people who deserve recognition in this House.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121314">I thank Sue Paul and Stephanie Smith who spearheaded the community, bringing us all together as the Sambro Island Lighthouse Heritage Society. They credit their nanny, Minnie Gilkie Smith, because without her admiration for and stories of the lighthouse, which she passed down to them and the rest of their family, they may not have felt so deeply rooted to that island and lighthouse.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121315">I thank Barry MacDonald for his support and mentoring of this group. I know he recently retired from the Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society, and that is a well-deserved retirement, but I also know that lighthouses are in his heart and we are bound to see him at a meeting or two.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121316">This lighthouse transcends party lines, and I would like to thank a few politicians across those party lines. Brendan Maguire, the Liberal MLA for Halifax Atlantic, has been steadfast in his commitment to this lighthouse. The member for <Affiliation DbId="170113" Type="2">Halifax West</Affiliation> has also worked on this issue and brought attention to it in the House, as has my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170509" Type="2">Sackville—Eastern Shore</Affiliation>. Members of the community of Sambro have named the member for <Affiliation DbId="170590" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margaret's</Affiliation> as a champion for lighthouses, and I agree with them. I thank Senators Munson and Cordy for also being lighthouse supporters, as well as local councillor Steve Adams.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121317">I thank the schoolchildren and the school of Sambro who supported this cause by selling bracelets and having awareness projects at school. The entire school drew pictures of the lighthouse and made a video of the children singing the lighthouse song. They sent the video to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>—I am sure he has it marked in his favourites list—and they have asked him to save their lighthouse.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121318">I thank <I>The Chebucto News</I>, which always made space in its publication for another story on the Sambro Island lighthouse. I thank the community members of Sambro for throwing themselves wholeheartedly into this project and gathering so many names for the petition, including Mishoo's store in Sambro, and Now We're Cookin' in Herring Cove. They had plenty of signatures for the petitions. I thank each and every person who took the time to gather names for this petition.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121319">I also want to thank lighthouse advocates Chris Mills and Rip Irwin. Rip was a founding member of the Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society, which started after a trip to Sambro Island lighthouse.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121320">As members can see, this is not just a lighthouse; this is part of our hearts, part of our community locally, but also part of the fabric of our history as Canadians. It is incredibly important to us. I agree with the <Affiliation DbId="194629" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> that this is an iconic structure for Canada. It is time to protect this lighthouse, and it is time for this lighthouse to shine on.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

					<Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Ms. Leslie" id="8705593"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170380" Type="2">Ms. Megan Leslie</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4121323">Mr. Speaker, I am going to give credit where credit is due. It was just a couple of weeks ago that there was an announcement in Sambro, as I mentioned, that the government is giving $1.5 million to the restoration of the lighthouse. That was seen as such an incredible win for the community. Everybody has been walking on air since that announcement.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121324">That announcement for the restoration is important. The stairs are falling apart, there are broken windows. Structurally, it is not safe. People are not even supposed to go up to it any more. Therefore, the restoration is vital if we are going to protect this lighthouse. But then what?</ParaText><ParaText id="4121325">I really believe that the step that would protect this lighthouse properly would be to transfer it from the Coast Guard or the Department of Fisheries and Oceans to Parks Canada. Parks Canada has a mandate to preserve and protect these structures. It is a national historic site. It has been celebrated with a stamp, a coin and acts in legislature. It really needs protection, not just the designation of a heritage site. I see bringing it under the inventory of Parks Canada as the next step.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

They are finding innovative ways through agencies such as ACOA, the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121327">One of the biggest complaints is that when these assets are transferred through Environment Canada to commemorations, they come with a commemoration. They come with the distinction of being what it is, but they never come with the money to help them jumpstart in a particular way.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121328">Would her bill provide for any type of operating funds or capital money to be available for these groups?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Therefore, he is pretty close to this issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121330">My bill would not include funding, and that is for a procedural reason. This is a private member's bill. I am not in government yet, so if money is attached to private members' bills, they require royal recommendation from government to do that and I was not expecting to get it. </ParaText><ParaText id="4121331">For a step in a private member's bill, I see a straight transfer to Parks Canada so that it is in the Parks Canada inventory. As the member heard earlier, there is a commitment of funds, $1.5 million, to restore the lighthouse, bring it back to its previous glory, and that is a fantastic step.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I am sure that what she said resonates with many people in coastal communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121333">I would like to talk about the cultural aspect of lighthouses. Communities have depended heavily on lighthouses as a link that kept them safe. Many families have lived in very remote regions to operate lighthouses and in Halifax too. Maritime communities, including fishers and sailors, have depended heavily on lighthouses.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121334">Many cultural communities have an interest in the work we are doing today to save not only the lighthouse in my colleague's riding, but those in all of Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="4121335">Can my colleague comment on the cultural aspect of lighthouses?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Those stories are as important as that structure, but those stories are tied to that structure.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Armstrong" id="8705606"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="209235" Type="18">Mr. Scott Armstrong (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Employment and Social Development and Minister of Labour, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4121338">Mr. Speaker, let us imagine people travelling across the ocean, from the old world to the new world, 200 years ago, and living through storms and the violence that can be the Atlantic Ocean, both in summer and in winter but particularly in winter.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121339">After four or five days on a boat, not really knowing exactly where they were, at the other end of the night, they would see a light, a beacon of hope that symbolizes not only land but a future for them and their family who are travelling to immigrate to a new world. That would be the story of many of my ancestors, the MacDonalds and the Armstrongs and the Tuckers and the Haymans, coming across from Europe to the new world.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121340">Fast forward 100 years or so to just after the turn of the century, when literally thousands and thousands of soldiers left Canada to travel to fight against the Germans in World War I. For many of them, the last thing they would have seen, looking back at their homeland, not ever knowing if they were going to return safely, would have been that light.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121341">Fast forward again another 50 years, when we had many settlers come from Europe post-World War II, people like my mother-in-law, who came over as a Dutch settler at the age of four, travelling with her family, a family with hope in their hearts, looking for a new, better life, escaping the ravages that were realized during World War II. Travelling across that ocean, literally millions of immigrants coming to Canada over the years, for many the first thing they would have seen of North America, the first thing they would have seen of this new life, would have been that light.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121342">That is what we are really here to talk about today, and I congratulate the member across for her diligence in working towards this particular piece of legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121343">We have a rich lighthouse heritage. Canadians passionately want to see this heritage protected for the benefit and enjoyment of not only past generations like the ones I have spoken about but for future generations of Canadians. Lighthouses speak to who we are and where we have been. We are one of the world's great maritime nations and lighthouses are a part of that historic nature of our country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121344"> This is why this House adopted the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act in 2008. My colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170590" Type="2">South Shore—St. Margaret's</Affiliation> has been a strong advocate for this legislation and continues to be, for lighthouses across the country. Although he is retiring this year, one of his legacies will be the Lighthouse Protection Act. I congratulate him for that.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121345">This is why Canadians nominated nearly 350 lighthouses to be considered for designation and protection as heritage lighthouses. Our government is determined to designate and protect as many of our lighthouses as possible under the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act. To date already, 74 heritage lighthouses have been designated under the act. A good number of these, 42 are still required as aids to navigation on our coasts and inland waterways and will remain under the custodianship of the Government of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121346">They include some of Canada's most significant symbols of our maritime heritage. Some examples are the Cape Spear lighthouse on the Atlantic Coast near St. John's, built in 1835; as well as the Fisgard Lighthouse on the Pacific coast near Victoria, built in 1860. There is also the Triple Island lighthouse on the North Pacific in British Columbia, recognized nationally for the logistical challenges involved with its construction, and the Cape Race lighthouse on the southern Avalon Peninsula in Newfoundland and Labrador.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121347">However, in many places in Canada, historic lighthouses are no longer needed to deliver Canada's extensive marine aid and navigation program. In these cases, our government has in place mechanisms to facilitate the acquisition of treasured historic lighthouses by community groups, other levels of government and, in rare cases, individuals. These different people, organizations and levels of government can breathe new life into these symbols of our nation by giving them a new use.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4121348">Identifying new owners for historic lighthouses that are no longer needed by the federal government is not just sound fiscal policy. We all know that the best protection for any heritage building is its continued use, and this is no less true for lighthouses than it is for houses, banks, schools, churches or other built markers of our shared heritage, our shared national identity.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121349">Through the implementation of the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act, viable, responsible new owners have been invited to submit proposals to acquire historic lighthouses that are no longer needed by the federal government, and to commit to protect their heritage character on behalf of all Canadians. The response from Canadians to this challenge has been nothing short of extraordinary. To date, community groups and other levels of government have submitted proposals to acquire more than 150 of Canada's historic lighthouses and to protect their heritage character. The majority of these proposals are considered viable, sustainable plans following review by Fisheries and Oceans Canada, which is a testament to the commitment of Canadians to conserve their heritage.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121350">Currently, of the 150 proposals we have received, there are 32 heritage lighthouses that have been designated, which will ensure the protection and conservation of the heritage character of these historic lighthouses on behalf of Canadians and for the benefit and enjoyment of generations of Canadians yet to come. Some of these 32 heritage lighthouses that will be managed by new owners are symbols of our small but proud and indomitable maritime communities that line our coasts and inland waterways.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121351">Yes, lighthouses such as the ones I have mentioned have economic value as well, as anchors for local and regional tourism, but the spirit that drives their conservation is more than economic. Canadians want to protect these properties because they speak to who we are. They are tangible, evocative markers of our maritime heritage.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121352">Other designated heritage lighthouses that will be managed by new owners are symbols of larger maritime communities. The Brighton Beach Range Front lighthouse, acquired by the City of Charlottetown, is but one example. </ParaText><ParaText id="4121353">These are some of the great examples of Canada's lighthouse heritage. The Government of Canada and Canadians are grateful to the new owners of these and other heritage lighthouses.

For generations, this sentinel of the sea has helped illuminate the safe passage of countless mariners off the treacherous waters of Chebucto Head. The Sambro Island lighthouse has been in operation for over 250 years.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121356">Over the years, members of the Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society, the Sambro Island Lighthouse Heritage Society and the local community have worked diligently to preserve, protect and promote this storied structure and educate people about its historical significance. In recognition of its importance, the Sambro Island lighthouse was declared a classified federal heritage building. In more recent years, it has also been commemorated by Canada Post and the Royal Canadian Mint.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121357">Our government wholeheartedly agrees that the Sambro Island lighthouse merits designation as a heritage lighthouse under the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act, but we want to do more than just designate the lighthouse. We need to do more. The Sambro Island lighthouse deserves a bright, secure future so that Canadians can enjoy and appreciate our very own heritage for generations to come.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121358">To do this, the Government of Canada must continue in its quest to find a viable, responsible new owner for the lighthouse who can articulate and implement a solid plan that will set this proud symbol of our shared maritime heritage on a course for another two and a half centuries of marking one of Canada's greatest harbours. Hopefully, it will stand strong for much longer than that.</ParaText>

We understand the need for federal stewardship on this issue and urge the government to work collaboratively with local leaders to develop an effective strategy to ensure the survival of the Sambro Island lighthouse.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121364">The Liberal Halifax-area member of Parliament has represented his constituents in the House of Commons regarding the preservation of the Sambro Lighthouse since 2013, and the Liberal Party of Canada has long advocated for recognition of the historical, cultural, and economic significance of Canada's lighthouses; we voted in support of the Heritage Lighthouse Protect Act.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121365">We support the bill but are concerned that it does not fully accomplish what the sponsoring member claims it does. Designating the Sambro Lighthouse a "designated heritage lighthouse" creates no obligation stemming from the bill for the federal government to operate the site in the future. She explained that earlier. </ParaText>

As the member mentioned, I believe, it was one of the first pieces of legislation. Construction was completed in 1759.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121372"> The light is located at the southern entrance to Halifax harbour.

The society is currently developing a business plan for the lighthouse with the hope of encouraging more tourism to the site and to help in maintaining the lighthouse as an historic site.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121379"> A petition was tabled in 2013 with more than 5,000 signatures in support of preserving the lighthouse. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4121380">There are also a great number of lighthouses that I would like to mention in my riding of Sydney—Victoria as well. I will talk about a couple in particular, because lighthouses are important. We have been very fortunate that some community groups recognize the cultural and historic importance of these lighthouses and have put a great deal of work into sharing their knowledge, and I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society. It is a great group.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121381">I believe that the province of Nova Scotia has more lighthouses than any other province because of length of shoreline and its rugged coast.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121382"> The St. Paul Island Historical Society worked for close to a decade to have a lighthouse relocated next to the St. Paul Island Museum. For 30 years or so, the lighthouse was at the Canadian Coast Guard jetty in Dartmouth. The lighthouse was dismantled in order to transport it by flatbed truck. The total cost of restoring, transporting, and erecting the lighthouse was $120,000. The federal government invested $108,000 in the project through Enterprise Cape Breton Corporation. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121383">Dingwall, which is a northern community in my riding, has a long maritime tradition and close ties to St. Paul Island. A lighthouse has operated on the island since 1839. The original southwest light was established in 1839, burned in 1916, and was replaced by a cast iron cylindrical lighthouse in 1917. The 1917 light was then replaced with an automatic system in 1962. This is what has happened to many lighthouses over the years.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121384">There has also been a community connection with St. Paul Island. Boats transported people and supplies to the island. Many people have relatives who worked on the island, so there is a close emotional and historic bond with the island. There were as many as 50 people living on the island at one time. There were life-saving stations, radio operators, and so on, and the museum is dedicated to that history.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121385">Canada's ocean shoreline is at least 250,000 kilometres in length. It is the longest shoreline in the world. Just minutes off the world-famous Cabot Trail, we can find Canada's first and only federally designated heritage lighthouse on any of Canada's three oceans. Built in 1915 and relocated in Dingwall, the St. Paul Southwest Lighthouse is also the first cast iron lighthouse constructed in Canada.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121386">An old map of St. Paul Island shows 40 shipwrecks, ranging from square-rigged ships to steam-powered vessels. This is described as only a partial list of wrecks in these dangerous waters off northern Cape Breton. Other sources say that as many as 350 ships went to the bottom of the sea there.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121387">The first lighthouse in Canada, and the second in North America, was constructed in Louisbourg in 1730. Its purpose was to protect ships by lighting their way into the harbour of the great French fortress of Louisbourg, perched on the far southeastern rocky coast of Cape Breton Island. In the years after Louisbourg was captured by the British, the fortress was levelled and the land was left desolate. There was no longer a need for a light, so it fell into ruin.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121388"> No other lighthouse existed or was necessary along the vast expanse of Nova Scotia's almost empty coastline until 1758, when the Sambro light was built at the far outer reaches of Halifax Harbour. A government lottery raised the necessary money for it. Thereafter, as pockets of settlements began to develop along the shoreline, the need for navigational aids became increasingly important. The development of hydrographic charts, printed sailing directions, and navigational markers and buoys facilitated daylight and fair-weather marine activities. Lighthouses, lightships, and fog alarms provided a measure of the security needed for nighttime and very bad weather.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121389">Lightkeeping was a hazardous and demanding career. In the 1930s, it was critical in Nova Scotia for a large, well-developed network to be in place. As I mentioned earlier, in the decades after World War II, changing patterns in coastal and international trade, the advent of radar and sophisticated navigational technology, and the ravages of wind, water, and time all combined to put an end to the Nova Scotia lighthouse world.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121390">Canada is built on many heritage buildings, and lighthouses are very important. We agree with this bill. It is indeed an important bill because of the historical importance, the cultural importance, and the impact that lighthouses have on the tourism industry in coastal communities.</ParaText>

The Government of Canada has an obligation and a duty to do that, but unfortunately, it is not stepping up. Heritage assets are being allowed to disintegrate little by little to the point where the very foundation of this great country's heritage is in jeopardy.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121394">I would like to emphasize that my support extends beyond this bill for the Sambro Island lighthouse. Many lighthouses in Canada have been declared surplus by the departments that own them. Most of the time, that is Fisheries and Oceans Canada. We must have the means to protect these pearls of Canada's heritage.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121395">Ads placed around the world to encourage people to visit Canada feature lighthouses. When we sing O Canada and watch the videos that go with it, we see images of lighthouses. These buildings are part of Canada's history, and we absolutely have to protect them. The bill before us is one step among many. It is one step toward protection.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121396">I would like to talk about the Sambro Island lighthouse, but I will also draw parallels with other lighthouses in Canada, particularly in my riding, which is a maritime riding with a lot of lighthouses. The people in my riding are very worried about the state of these lighthouses. We know that the Sambro Island lighthouse in particular is located just off the coast of Halifax. It is a major part of our heritage and history since it was likely one of the most important lighthouses in Canada. It was built during the Seven Years' War and established by the very first act passed by the Nova Scotia House of Assembly in 1758. Construction took place from 1758 to 1760.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121397">Let us remember that lighthouses were the gateway to many areas of Canada, not just Halifax. The Sambro Island lighthouse was the first lighthouse that people saw when they immigrated to our maritime provinces. As our Liberal Party colleague pointed out, people had to pass right by it to get to Pier 21 in Halifax.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121398">I would like to point out that in my riding of Gaspésie—Îles-de-la-Madeleine, the first lighthouse that was seen when Canada was made up of only Ontario and Quebec was the Cap-des-Rosiers lighthouse, which is located just outside Gaspé. It is the tallest lighthouse in Canada, and it was the first lighthouse that immigrants saw when they came to Canada before Confederation. Of course, after Confederation, our neighbours in the Maritimes also had lighthouses, but while Canada was made up of only Ontario and Quebec, the gateway was Gaspé and the point of entry was the Cap-des-Rosiers lighthouse. These lighthouses are part of our heritage. They are part of our history and our wealth.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121399">There are also a number of lighthouses in the Magdalen Islands. Without those lighthouses, the shipwrecks that plagued the Magdalen Islands for hundreds of years would have continued. There are hundreds of shipwrecks off the coast of the Magdalen Islands. These ships sank because years ago, people did not have the proper equipment and there were no lighthouses. Lighthouses were mainly built in the 1800s.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121400">Lighthouses are slowly being dismantled, particularly in the Magdalen Islands. Climate change has resulted in an increasing number of major storms. Those storms cause erosion, which is jeopardizing all of the lighthouses in the Magdalen Islands. It is a major concern. We have already had to move some lighthouses in order to save them.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121401">The government brought in legislation to preserve lighthouses. I would like to point out, however, that the legislation that the Conservatives passed in 2010, quite frankly, does nothing to preserve the lighthouses in the Magdalen Islands and the Gaspé, and it will not preserve the Sambro Island lighthouse. The act provides for a divestiture program for lighthouses. Once again, the government has plans to divest itself of lighthouses, wharves and other kinds of infrastructure, but it is unwilling to invest any money in repairs prior to their divestiture. Those who take over these lighthouses will be left with some nasty surprises.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="45">(1145)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4121402">We find it very hard to get behind a government that refuses to recognize that it failed in its responsibility. The government has a duty to maintain its facilities, assets and property, and this includes lighthouses.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121403">For instance, there has been no maintenance done on the Cap-des-Rosiers lighthouse in the past 20 years. This causes serious problems, such as water leaks and damage to the structure. Because of the many winter storms, these water leaks exacerbate the situation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121404">The government needs to update its facilities and infrastructure long before even considering their divestiture. Very few organizations have the resources to take over responsibility for these kinds of infrastructure, since the annual maintenance is very costly. That is why we hope that the government will be prepared to maintain its assets and property.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121405">In the Gaspé, some poorly maintained lighthouses have had to be taken over by municipalities and private organizations. In her speech on the bill, my colleague pointed out that some community groups in Halifax would be willing to take over at least the management of the lighthouse, but they would be unable to pay for long-term maintenance. Only governments are in a position to do so.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121406"> I hope the government will grasp the multiplier effect of investing in lighthouses. When tourists are drawn to our beautiful regions by the lighthouses they see in ads, they expect those lighthouses to be not only there and in good shape, but also accessible. When lighthouses are in the sorry state that they are in now, they get shuttered and no one is allowed to enter them. People are only allowed to look at them. Truth be told, even that may no longer be possible since lighthouses are located in coastal regions where they are exposed to erosion and their potential demise in a storm.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121407">Let us not forget that through the divestiture process, the federal government offers to transfer the asset to the province first. If the province refuses, then it is offered to the municipality. Finally, if neither party is prepared to take it, it will be offered to individuals. That is how our lighthouses could become privatized. That is what happened in the Magdalen Islands, where a lighthouse became the property of a single individual. Today, that lighthouse is no longer accessible and can no longer be part of an historic trail or route for tourists.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121408">Even though some organizations have plans to take advantage of lighthouses as tourist attractions, the lighthouses that were handed over to individuals are not necessarily accessible to the public. The privatization of our heritage and historical infrastructure is very concerning.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121409">Five to six lighthouses in the Magdalen Islands and a number of lighthouses in the Gaspé have been declared surplus. However, they have been recognized as being heritage lighthouses. I would like to remind members that the Cap-des-Rosiers lighthouse was designated a national historic site in 1974. In 1994, it was recognized as a heritage lighthouse.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121410">However, the enactment of the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act in 2010 shows that the government wants to get rid of these lighthouses. That means it does not keep its promises. The government absolutely has to take its responsibilities seriously and invest in our infrastructure. There is no denying the multiplier effect of investments, which must be made in order to keep regional economies going. Lighthouses are an integral part of that.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4121411">This is not just about the economy; it is also about culture. The lives of mariners and fishers have been saved because of these lighthouses. Families living in coastal communities are still there because the lighthouses protected their ancestors. We must respect our ancestors and our coastal communities. We must invest in our lighthouses.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I want to echo the words of my colleagues who have spoken on this issue before me in the House. Canadians have spoken clearly. Our lighthouse heritage matters and needs to be protected.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121414">Like Bill <Document DbId="6495738" Type="4">C-588</Document>, the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act originated as a private member's bill, and its principles resonated so clearly with parliamentarians that it was enacted unopposed. I would say, just to clarify the record, that it had a couple of opportunities to move first from the Senate and then to the House of Commons before it actually was approved, and I do not believe that anyone has recognized late Senator Mike Forrestall's support of that bill. It really was his idea and dream. Unfortunately, he did not live long enough to see it fulfilled, but he was certainly the keystone for that private member's legislation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121415"> When the act finally came into force, Canadians responded by nominating nearly 350 lighthouses for designation through a petition process established by the act, and our government is proud of the progress that has been made over the five years since the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act came into force. Today there are 74 designated heritage lighthouses that are protected for the future. As impressive as these results are, it is gratifying to know that many more lighthouses will be considered for designation in the months and years ahead as Fisheries and Oceans Canada concludes agreements to transfer historic lighthouses to responsible new owners who have demonstrated their ability and desire to implement a sustainable, long-term plan for the conservation of their local lighthouses.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121416">Sambro Island lighthouse is one of those lighthouses that occupies a special place in Canada's maritime heritage. It was established in 1758 and is the oldest operating lighthouse in the Americas. It is located on Sambro Island, at the entrance to Halifax Harbour, and is surrounded by a dangerous maze of rocks and shoals. This lighthouse has guided countless people to safety while also being a silent witness to numerous shipwrecks and sea battles. For generations this lighthouse has served its purpose well by guiding mariners into and out of one of the largest, most impressive natural harbours in the world.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121417">Its construction was designated by the Government of Canada as an event of national historical significance way back in 1937, so its special heritage value has long been recognized. More recently, the Sambro Island lighthouse was designated a classified federal heritage building in 1996, and through that designation it enjoys the highest level of heritage protection accorded to federal buildings. It should be reassuring for all to know that the heritage character of this important lighthouse already enjoys strong protection under the custodianship of Fisheries and Oceans Canada. Since 2008 we have invested nearly $40,000 in the lighthouse, which includes repairing concrete, painting the tower base, and sealing a concrete walkway.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121418">As reassuring as this is, it is important to note that the heritage character of the Sambro Island lighthouse is currently protected. Our government also wants to see it designated and protected under the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act and join the growing family of heritage lighthouses being created by the Government of Canada in partnership with community groups and other levels of government all across Canada. Sambro Island lighthouse merits designation under this act.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121419">It is also important to note that Sambro Island lighthouse is not under any imminent threat of neglect or demolition. As a classified federal heritage building, the Sambro Island lighthouse is currently afforded the same level of protection as would be offered under the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act. Nevertheless, our government is determined to find a viable, responsible owner for the Sambro Island lighthouse, a new owner who has a vision for a sustainable new use for Sambro Island, with its iconic lighthouse and related light station buildings, and the wherewithal, of course, to make that vision a reality.

It contains many clauses that cannot be amended. Why? They came out of a five-year review of the Yukon Environmental Assessment Act and were agreed to. Many changes to the Environmental Assessment Act were worked out through a process of collaboration, understanding and collaboration between the government and the people of Yukon.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121447">After that process, four very controversial items were added to this bill and then arbitrarily put to the people of Yukon. </ParaText><ParaText id="4121448">The first would provide the <Affiliation DbId="191408" Type="4">Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development</Affiliation> the authority to provide binding policy direction to the Yukon Environmental and Socio-economic Assessment Board, to which Yukoners are opposed. They had no chance to work with anyone to mitigate that.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121449">The second would legislate time limits for assessments in the face of the fact that the assessment process was working just fine in Yukon, and that people had learned how to deal with very complex issues in an orderly fashion.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121450">The third would allow the <Affiliation DbId="191408" Type="4">Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development</Affiliation> to delegate any or all responsibilities to the Yukon government without consultation with and approval from the first nations who were party to the whole deal that was set up in the first place. </ParaText><ParaText id="4121451">The fourth would create broad exemptions with respect to the Yukon environmental assessment process for renewals, amendments and permits authorizations, which were in the hands of the boards already.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121452">We can see that the devolution process in the northern territories, which in Yukon started 10 years ago, has been curtailed by this legislation. It has been rolled back in a very significant and deliberate fashion by the government. That is not appropriate.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121453">The other amendments proposed to the act dealt with things that people could see and agree to. They were designed to help move the act forward in a proper fashion so the environmental assessment process could be well-respected and understood.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121454">We have had the same problem in the Northwest Territories. The government agreed to a devolution process and then forced changes to our environmental assessment process. That has now gone to court and there have been injunctions put in place by the court over the actions taken by the government in the Northwest Territories.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121455">We are likely to see the same thing in Yukon, where the first nations will once again have to take the government to court to deal with issues that should have been dealt with in a proper fashion.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121456">Therefore, we have identified four issues and are asking that they be removed from the act through these amendments. It is a request that goes back to the people of Yukon, who have asked for this.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121457">We took the committee to Yukon and had a one-day hearing, which went from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. The room was filled with hundreds of people who attended the committee hearing from 8:30 a.m. until it finished in the evening. They were not pleased with the bill.</ParaText>

The Government of Yukon, which will face its own electors over this very shortly, will find out how those people feel about the bill. This will also be the case for the Conservative government very soon.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121459">After the election, which is likely to be in October unless the government decides to try to delay it even more, the new NDP government will be ready to put forward amendments to deal with these contentious issues for the people of the north.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121460">There is no reason at all for this to have happened in the fashion it did. The government has created uncertainty in the environmental assessment process for the companies, people and the first nations of Yukon. It has messed it up.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121461">Let me quote Ms. Allison Rippin Armstrong, vice president Lands and Environment, Kaminak Gold Corporation, which has just invested substantial sums of money in the Yukon. She said:</ParaText><ParaText id="4121462"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Kaminak is concerned that the process through which YESAA is being amended is creating increased distrust between governments and uncertainty in the assessment and regulatory process for current and future projects in Yukon.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4121463">These are the people who are investing in the Yukon.</ParaText>

On the one hand, we have industry saying that it will not work for them, that it does not need it and do not even understand why it is being done. On the other hand, first nations are saying that things are being done against all their agreements and that are really throwing the process, which they worked so hard to set up, off the back of the cart. They want to know why the government has done it and what the purpose is of this kind of action by the government. They want to know if it is simply because the party of one over in the Langevin Block has decided that this is the way it will go, that no one can interfere with that kind of decision making, that no one from the grassroots up can make a difference.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121467">The government is making rules for territories that actually need devolution. They need to control their own affairs. The government has actually thrown that particular process off the back of the cart. It is heading off in a different direction. People in the territories, my territory, Yukon, who have been influenced by these bills, now face the prospect of suing the government, of going forward with litigation in order to get rid of some of these contentious clauses, which nobody really wants, which do not make any sense and which are not part of any reduction of colonialism or changing the way these territories can govern themselves.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121468">We have put forward a number of amendments which deal with the four contentious issues. We would hope that the government, in the end, would come to its senses and would actually listen to the people of Yukon, industry and those who are involved in the actual work of Yukon, rather than sitting over on Langevin Block, and come to an understanding that these need to be removed to make this bill work. Then we could go ahead and all support it.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

From promoting prosperity and development through Bill <Document DbId="6821441" Type="3">C-47</Document>, the Northern Jobs and Growth Act, to devolving powers to the Government of the Northwest Territories through Bill <Document DbId="6349930" Type="3">C-15</Document>, the Northwest Territories Devolution Act, to the vision and implementation of the Canadian High Arctic research station, no other government in Canadian history has done more than ours to increase health, prosperity and economic development in the north.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121479">The initiative before the House today, the Yukon and Nunavut regulatory improvement act, or Bill <Document DbId="6641164" Type="3">S-6</Document>, would represent yet another key deliverable of our government's northern strategy and would be the final legislative step in our government's action plan to improve northern regulatory regimes.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121480">In total, our government has created or amended eight different pieces of legislation in order to ensure that northern regulatory regimes across the north are nimble and responsive to the increased economic activity taking place across the north. This is no small feat. These legislative changes will allow Canada's north to compete for investment in an increasingly global marketplace which, in turn, will lead to jobs, growth and long-term prosperity for northerners. Bill <Document DbId="6641164" Type="3">S-6</Document> would continue in this vein.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121481">The introduction of beginning-to-end time limits for environmental assessments included in the bill would align the Yukon regime with the time limits in similar acts within the north, as well as south of 60, and would provide predictability and consistency to first nations, municipalities and industry alike.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121482">This is an incredibly important aspect of Bill <Document DbId="6641164" Type="3">S-6</Document> and one that would act to drive economic development across the territory. Unfortunately, the NDP wants to remove these time limits. I take particular exception to Motions Nos. 5, 6 and 7, which would cause the portions of the bill related to time limits to be deleted. This would prevent regulatory predictability and actually hinder growth and prosperity in the Yukon.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121483">Some have argued that the time limits would affect the thoroughness of the assessment process. However, as the Yukon Environmental and Socio-economic Assessment Board's own statistics show, the proposed time limits are either consistent with or more favourable than the board's current practice. In addition, Bill <Document DbId="6641164" Type="3">S-6</Document> would include provisions to allow for extensions, recognizing that there may be situations when more time is warranted to carry out a function or power.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121484">A different provision in the act, specifically, the proposed amendment to section 49.1 of YESAA, would ensure that, going forward, reassessments would only be required in the event that the project has been significantly changed.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121485">This is another integral piece of Bill <Document DbId="6641164" Type="3">S-6</Document> that the opposition would eliminate. That is why I oppose Motion No. 4. The passage of the motion and the elimination of the clause would prevent the elimination of unnecessary delays and red tape in the approval process.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121486">In the past, projects that have already been approved and permitted could be subject to a new environmental assessment simply because of a renewal or a minor change in the project. The amendment would help to streamline the process and reduce unnecessary red tape where it is not warranted. </ParaText><ParaText id="4121487">The amendment would also make it clear that if there is more than one decision body, which could be a federal, territorial or first nations government or agency that regulates and permits the proposed activity, they must consult with one another before determining whether a new assessment is required. Further still, the legislation would specify that in the event of a disagreement, if only one decision body determines that a significant change has occurred, it must be subject to a reassessment. This would also be consistent with the UFA, the Umbrella Final Agreement, which states in section 12.4.1.1 that projects and significant changes to existing projects are subject to the development assessment process.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121488">Another proposed change would be the ability for the <Affiliation DbId="170392" Type="2">Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development </Affiliation>to provide policy direction to the Yukon Environmental and Socio-economic Assessment Board.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121489">This is another amendment that the opposition would like to remove from the bill. Motion No. 10 would remove the ability of the minister to issue policy direction.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4121490">It is important to remember that the ability to provide policy direction is not a heavy-handed attempt by the government to interfere in the assessment process nor does it undermine the neutrality of the board. Quite the contrary, it is intended to ensure a common understanding between the government and the board, helping to reduce uncertainty in environmental assessment decision-making and helping to ensure the proper implementation of the board's powers in fulfilling its role in the assessment process.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121491">Moreover, this power exists in the Northwest Territories where it has only been used four times, and in each case it was used to clearly communicate expectations on how to address first nations' rights or agreements. For example, it was used in order to ensure that notification was provided to both the Manitoba and Saskatchewan Deline regarding licences and permits in a given region.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121492">By supporting this motion, the opposition would actually remove a tool that the minister could use to ensure that aboriginal rights are protected. Perhaps not surprisingly, during our committee study when we were in the Yukon, the NDP member for <Affiliation DbId="170613" Type="2">Algoma—Manitoulin—Kapuskasing</Affiliation> said it was paternalistic for the minister to try to protect aboriginal rights through policy direction. The NDP obviously does not want the minister to exercise the duty he has been given to protect aboriginal rights in Canada, calling that paternalistic. It is completely bizarre.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121493">I want to assure members that this power in no way detracts from the board's independence. YESAB will remain an impartial and independent arm's-length entity responsible for making recommendations to decision bodies.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121494">The legislative amendment also makes it clear that policy directions cannot be used to influence a specific project or change the environmental assessment process itself. </ParaText><ParaText id="4121495">It is for these reasons that I oppose the passage of Motion No. 10, and encourage other members to do the same.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121496">Another amendment of concern is the minister's ability to delegate certain powers in the act to a territorial minister. Some have suggested that this amendment is an attempt by this government to shirk its responsibilities to the Yukon first nations and is inconsistent with the tripartite nature of the land claim agreement.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121497"> I want to be very clear that these concerns are completely unfounded. First of all, any delegation must be consistent with the UFA. Second, the Umbrella Final Agreement permits delegation. Specifically, the definition of “government” includes both the federal and territorial governments, depending on which government or governments have responsibility from time to time for the matter in question. Section 2.11.8 of the agreement states that “Government may determine, from time to time, how and by whom any power or authority of Government or a Minister set out in a Settlement Agreement...shall be exercised”.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121498">Not least of all, this measure is in keeping with our government's objective of devolving responsibility to the territories and moving decision-making closer to home. That is, away from Ottawa bureaucracy and right into the hands of Yukoners themselves.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121499">This legislation is clearly both needed and wanted north of 60. It satisfies calls to modernize northern regulatory regimes and ensure consistency with other regulatory regimes across the north and in the rest of Canada, while protecting the environment and strengthening northern governance.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121500">For all these reasons, I urge all-party support for this worthy act as it stands, and to reject all of the amendments to Bill <Document DbId="6641164" Type="3">S-6</Document> that are before the House today.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

							<ParaText id="4121562"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2"> ...it is becoming increasingly clear that changes to this legislation before you today are essential in order for Yukon to remain a competitive place to do business. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4121563">This work is overseen by the Yukon Environmental and Socio-economic Assessment Board, whose mission is to protect the environmental and social integrity of Yukon while fostering responsible development in the territory, responsible development that reflects the values of Yukoners and respects the contributions of first nations.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121564"> I would like to focus my remarks today on one portion of the bill. It is the provision that would allow the <Affiliation DbId="191408" Type="4">Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development</Affiliation> to issue policy direction to the YESAA board. </ParaText><ParaText id="4121565">The proposed legislation would enable the minister, following consultation with the board, to provide binding policy direction with respect to the exercise or performance of its powers, duties, or functions. This has raised concerns in some quarters that it would give the federal government authority to impose its own policies on projects on first nation settlement land. I can assure members that this is not the intention of the amendment nor the way it has been used in practice. In reality, policy directions have been used to add clarity and to ensure that all parties are on the same page with respect to existing laws. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121566">The reason the change is being proposed is to ensure a common understanding between the Government of Canada and the board. For example, the minister could use policy direction to communicate expectations regarding the use of new technologies to mitigate environmental impacts or expectations regarding roles and responsibilities related to aboriginal consultation. This clarification would reduce uncertainty and delays in environmental assessment decision-making. </ParaText><ParaText id="4121567">In recognition of the board's independence, there would be strict limits on the minister's ability to provide policy direction. To be precise, policy direction would have to be consistent with YESAA and with the Umbrella Final Agreement. In fact, YESAA states that first nations' final agreements will prevail in the event of an inconsistency or conflict. Furthermore, policy direction could not interfere with active or completed reviews, again because the board operates at arm's length from government. </ParaText><ParaText id="4121568">To be clear, policy direction could not change the environmental assessment process itself. In fact, Bill <Document DbId="6641164" Type="3">S-6</Document> explicitly states that policy directions do not apply to project proposals that have already been submitted to the board.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121569"> It is also important to note that the ability to issue policy direction is not without precedent. In fact, the <Affiliation DbId="191408" Type="4">Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development</Affiliation> already holds the ability to issue policy direction to the Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board in the Northwest Territories. With respect to this board, policy direction has only ever been used four times, and each time it was to ensure that the board respected and upheld interim agreements the Government of Canada held with aboriginal groups. </ParaText>

In fact, section 2.11.8 of the Yukon Umbrella Final Agreement states:</ParaText><ParaText id="4121576"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> Government may determine, from time to time, how and by whom any power or authority of Government or a Minister set out in a Settlement Agreement...shall be exercised.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121577">Moreover, the principle behind this delegation, that decisions about northern governance are best made in the north, is consistent with our government's northern strategy. In fact, just last year, our government brought into force Bill <Document DbId="6349930" Type="3">C-15</Document>, which devolved all responsibility for lands and resources out of Ottawa and back to the territorial governments. </ParaText><ParaText id="4121578">This, in short, is why I believe that the ability to delegate authority to the Government of Yukon is an integral component of Bill <Document DbId="6641164" Type="3">S-6</Document> and why I am so disappointed to see the Green Party oppose this clause. I strongly oppose the passage of that motion, and I hope that all members of the House join me in voting against it. </ParaText><ParaText id="4121579">The opposition actually supported that initiative when it was before the House, but now they are opposing the very same principle when implemented in the Yukon.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121580">I remind my hon. colleagues that the amendments to YESAA proposed in Bill <Document DbId="6641164" Type="3">S-6</Document> address agreed upon recommendations from the five-year review or have been directly requested by the Government of Yukon so that the act can better serve all residents of Yukon, aboriginal and non-aboriginal alike.

This is a supposedly independent board that came about as a result of discussions and negotiations out of the land claims agreement and the Final Umbrella Agreement, and now we would have the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development make binding policy directives.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121684">How does that maintain the relationship between the aboriginal people, the Yukon government and the Government of Canada in this particular process?</ParaText><ParaText id="4121685">It has been said here that it is only to ensure that the aboriginal rights are being protected, but that is not what the legislation says.

In this case, the people who will be affected by these decisions have not been adequately consulted. The government unfortunately has a habit of not consulting people on a number of issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121719">It is even more troubling in the case of the Yukon, which we are discussing today. Not too long ago, Bill C-15, if I am not mistaken, gave more powers to the territories, which was in line with what was done in the Northwest Territories a few years ago. We recently adopted the same type of approach with the Yukon.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121720">It appears as though the pendulum is swinging the other way now. The government is bringing the power back to Ottawa and is giving itself more discretionary powers. This bill is a way to push through some natural resource development projects and to once again gut our environmental protection laws, which is another worrisome trend from this government.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121721"> Since we started the debate this afternoon, the <Affiliation DbId="194846" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development</Affiliation> has been telling us that everyone in the Yukon agrees that the existing rules only delay the process, since it is unpredictable. However, as my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170508" Type="2">St. John's East</Affiliation> just pointed out, the rules proposed by the Conservatives make the situation even more unpredictable, since they simply say that if any communities in the Yukon are unhappy with the result they will have to go to court.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121722">Speaking of trends, that is another one we are seeing more and more of all the time. Instead of being proactive and proposing legislation and an approach to governance that does not require legal proceedings, the government seems to be saying that this is not so bad because these people can turn to the courts. The focus is on the cure instead of prevention. If the government wants to have a real dialogue, then it has to prevent these conflicts where people, particularly first nations, feel that their rights are being trampled. Dragging things through the courts prolongs and encumbers the process, which makes the situation even harder for businesses that want to propose a project.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121723">The interesting thing in the debates on the environment and the economy is the matter of environmental assessments. That came up again today, through this bill. If we took this responsibility seriously, we would not be obstructing those who advocate sustainable and responsible development. However, the government seems to believe that such legislation always gets in the way of development. Instead of trying to come up with better assessments, the government simply wants to get rid of them all. Words like social acceptability often come up when we talk about natural resource development projects. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121724">It is clear that Bill <Document DbId="6641164" Type="3">S-6</Document> has failed when it comes to social acceptability. The federal government might say that the territories are different from the provinces, but we must not play political games with the rights of the people of the Yukon and of the Yukon's first nations.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121725">The parliamentary secretary talked about funding that was offered to the first nations, but that is not enough. The dialogue cannot be driven by money alone. There has to be a proactive attitude, a willingness to reach out and some openness.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121726">We can have all the tools and resources in the world, but if we do not believe that they will be useful and that this dialogue will improve things, then it is hard to bring two or more partners to the table.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4121727">The <Affiliation DbId="194846" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> also said there were many meetings, but that is precisely one of the things that people, including first nations, are upset about. Closed-door meetings do not count as public consultation. It is pretty easy to sit down with select stakeholders, then say that consultations were held and people should be satisfied with that. The problem, once again, is what people are feeling. I want to respond again to the parliamentary secretary's remarks. He just asked if the NDP will be challenging all of the legislation about which witnesses say they were not adequately consulted.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121728">We all know that in politics it is impossible to please everyone, but when it comes to Bill <Document DbId="6641164" Type="3">S-6</Document>, everything we heard in committee and in the Yukon points to agreement among members of the public and first nations: the consultations were inadequate. That is why the Yukon NDP moved a motion in the legislature there to condemn this bill. Sure, they can pull out quotes here and there to support the argument that this is a step forward, but I am not talking about an exception; I am saying that most people think this.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121729">Consequently, I believe that it is important to recognize that the government's approach is problematic. All too often, people condemn its bills and its approach and the government views them as exceptions. Very often these people are voicing the concerns of the majority, and therefore it is all the more important for the government to listen.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121730">In matters affecting first nations especially, this is happening more and more frequently. One of my colleagues spoke about the government's paternalistic approach in its relations with first nations. That is the problem, more than the bill's outcome. When the government is considering making such a fundamental change to the way a territory is managed—a change that could call into question some rights enjoyed by first nations—telling them to just go to court reflects a paternalistic approach. There is no doubt about that, and we see it all too often with this government. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121731">I made a mistake at the beginning of my speech. I said Bill C-6, but I meant Bill <Document DbId="6641164" Type="3">S-6. </Document> There again, Senate bills are increasingly common, and that is a problem. This is not a Senate bill, but a government bill that is proposing to make a very important, even draconian change to how the Yukon conducts its environmental assessments. The bill would also give discretionary powers to the minister.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121732">The fact that the Senate passed such a bill and sent us such a fundamental change is very problematic in terms of how our two chambers operate, and it is especially problematic when we consider how long it takes for the Senate to pass private members' bills originating in the House of Commons. Consider, for example, the bill introduced by the member for <Affiliation DbId="170462" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</Affiliation> on the rights of transgendered people. The Senate is dragging its feet on passing it. Unfortunately, at this rate, it will not even pass before the election is called. I am using this as an example because Bill <Document DbId="6641164" Type="3">S-6</Document> is a government bill, and we know how quickly senators pass government bills and how long it takes them to pass private members' bills. I think this clearly illustrates the problems that arise as a result of how the system works, and this only adds to public cynicism.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4121733">I touched on this earlier, but the issue of ministers' discretionary powers is becoming more and more common in government-sponsored bills. This government likes to govern in such a way that ministers are too often allowed to use discretionary powers to adopt certain policies. This is extremely troubling and worrisome when it comes to environmental assessments.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121734">The government prides itself on having a system of checks and balances in place, but those checks and balances are the courts. Everyone knows that the courts are a good tool for protecting fundamental rights, but at the same time, a good government should not settle for getting to that point. I realize I am repeating myself, but this is really what stands out the most on this particular issue.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4121735">In closing, I would like to reiterate that we are prepared to work with the people of Yukon. The Yukon NDP is doing a terrific job.

We can do this job properly.</ParaText><ParaText id="4121736">Unfortunately, all too often, the federal government is content to just centralize and impose its way of doing things on others. That is not how we believe that things should be done. There must be an open dialogue among the various nations, particularly the first nations. That is the approach that we advocate and this would be an opportunity to implement that approach. That is why we are opposed to this bill.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The majority of the directors are nominated or appointed directly by municipalities in the region served by the airport, as well as local and regional business or other socio-economic organizations, such as boards of trade, chambers of commerce and consumers associations.  The federal and provincial governments also nominate or appoint individuals to airport authority boards of directors. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122048">No elected officials, whether from the municipal, provincial or federal level of government, are eligible for appointment to CAA boards of directors.

This is an important legislative measure, since, for the first time in 20 years, it will make a significant change to the way in which firearms licences are awarded in Canada.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4122080">There are eight important measures in this common-sense legislation that highlight the clear approach our Conservative government is taking to firearms' policies, namely it is that policies should promote safety but that they must also be sensible.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122081">I served in the Canadian Armed Forces for 20 years, and in doing so acquired professional knowledge regarding firearms, firearms safety and firearms responsibilities. Now as a civilian, I have gone through the process of obtaining my possession and acquisition licence. As a firearm owner myself and as a sport shooter, I can say that the important changes contained in the bill are needed and much appreciated by law-abiding Canadian gun owners.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4122082"> I can also say that these policies and, more generally, this bill, have the support of a large number of Canadians from coast to coast.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122083">Before I get into the details, I would like to start by explaining where I stand on this debate. This is a debate about culture. Hunting, fishing, trapping and sport shooting are all proud parts of our Canadian heritage.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4122084">Were it not for these activities, the brave men and women who settled Canada would simply never have been able to undertake and sustain the exploration that has grown into the greatest country in the world. Not only that, many young Canadians can look back fondly on hunting excursions with their family.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4122085">We need to encourage this type of activity.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4122086">However, the firearms policies crafted by the previous Liberal government often served to dissuade people from engaging in these Canadian heritage activities. Policies that criminalize the ownership of firearms will simply discourage individuals from becoming involved. The same can be said for increased needless paperwork.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122087">Former Liberal justice minister and father of the long gun registry, Allan Rock, said that he that he came to Ottawa with the firm belief that only police and the military should have firearms. On this side of the House, we could not disagree more.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4122088">That is exactly why we introduced the bill before us today.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4122089">As I said a moment ago, the bill continues to deliver on our record of safe and sensible firearms policies. These two themes run throughout the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122090"> First, I would like to touch on how the bill would keep us safe.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122091"> Our Conservative government has a strong record in tackling the criminal use of firearms. We have passed a series of new measures to ensure that criminals who use firearms go to prison for a very long time. For example, we created a new offence to criminalize drive-by and other reckless shootings. The bill before us today builds on this with three key measures.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122092"> First, we will establish mandatory firearms safety training for first-time firearms owners. This is a very important change because, in the past, individuals were able to simply challenge the test, which did not ensure any level of consistency in knowledge of how to safely operate a firearm. This change is widely supported. For example, Pierre Latraverse of the Fédération québécoise des chasseurs et pêcheurs said, “This bill...simplifies the procedures for awarding a permit for users who follow the law, while strengthening safety and education”.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122093"> Second, in the area of public safety, the bill before us today would amend the Criminal Code to strengthen the provisions relating to order prohibiting the possession of firearms where a person would be convicted of an offence involving domestic violence.</ParaText>

							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4122098">I would like to expand on this important point if I may. When a business imports a restricted or prohibited firearm, it has to complete forms and the merchandise has to be examined by the Canada Border Services Agency at the border. The business also has to register the firearms when they are received in the shop before they can be sold.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122099">However, the two agencies are operating in silos. If a business tells the Canada Border Services Agency that it has 5,000 units but registers just 3,000 with the RCMP, nobody compares those numbers. Consequently, 2,000 units could end up on the black market. That is a big problem, especially in British Columbia. That is why this was raised during federal, provincial and territorial meetings, and that is why we are pleased to be taking action on this important issue.</ParaText>

If I let my driver's licence, my dog licence, my fishing licence or any other licence lapse, I may have to pay a fine or be subject to another regulatory punishment. If I let my firearms licence lapse, I could go to prison for a significant length of time. It is clear that the threat of prison time for administrative oversight deserves special attention for leniency.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122104">However, we do not want this new measure to be abused. That is why, under the legislation, an individual would not be allowed to purchase new firearms or ammunition or even use their firearms during that time. However, a person would not become an overnight criminal as the result of a simple, honest mistake. That is common sense policy. No one who is not simply ideologically opposed to the civilian possession of firearms can disagree with this measure.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122105"> Even the NDP member for <Affiliation DbId="170462" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</Affiliation> had to agree that this was common sense in committee.

He said, “I do agree with some of our other presenters is that perhaps a failure to renew shouldn't result in an immediate criminal charge”.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122106">The next measure to make our firearms policies more sensible is the merger of the possession-only licence and the possession and acquisition licence. Again, this makes good sense.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122107"> The possession-only licence was created by the previous Liberal government as a grandfathering system. Those who did not want to engage in the new bureaucratic regime would not have their firearms taken away, but they would not be able to purchase any new ones, either. This group of firearms owners averages approximately 60 years of age and has owned firearms in excess of 20 years. This group is clearly experienced in the safe handling and use of firearms. That is why this legislative change would give purchasing rights to nearly 600,000 individuals.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122108">Let me again quote Pierre Latraverse of the Fédération québécoise des chasseurs et pêcheurs, who said:</ParaText><ParaText id="4122109"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">It's a very positive measure, given that there will only be a single licence under these conditions.

Any consultations that did take place took place well after the bill had been introduced and took place in private. No one else was consulted, and clearly not any of the victim groups that the government always claims to keep top of mind when it comes to crime.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122173">The parliamentary secretary has tried to characterize this poor consideration as somehow a failure of the opposition to do our job, which is a curious charge that implicitly admits that the bill has not received the consideration it should have.

Perhaps it is a concern over funding, since we have seen groups that have opposed the government find that funding for their programming has been chopped. Perhaps it is a concern over charitable status, because if the witnesses happen to represent a charity, their organization may end up being audited by the Conservative government.

I stand by that statement, but I would point out that the Conservatives have tried to ascribe a very broad meaning to the term “gun lobby” that few others would actually use. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122176">What we on this side of the House mean when we use the term is not all gun owners, not all hunters and fishers, but a small group of people, including some gun dealers and manufacturers and some paid lobbyists, who spend their time hanging around at Parliament to promote a very narrow agenda. That agenda is to remove all restrictions on guns in Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122177">The first target of this narrow lobby was the gun registry, which is now gone and will not be coming back. However, they have now moved on to other goals, and this bill is a part of that lobby effort. It is an agenda that very few gun owners would actually know anything about, and the shorter the time we spend on it in Parliament, the less they will know.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122178">The Conservatives continue to promote the dangerous ideas of this gun lobby. They represent a small minority of Canadians, and, I would argue, a minority even among gun owners. This is the idea that any regulations at all on firearms are so-called red tape that pit the interests of law-abiding gun owners against the government and police and amount to nothing more than restrictions on rights or freedoms. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122179">As I have pointed out before, and like his gun lobby allies, the <Affiliation DbId="194614" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness</Affiliation> has fallen into the habit of using U.S. rhetoric in his comments on firearms. This was never so clear than on July 23 of last year, when the minister said, “To possess a firearm is a right, and it's a right that comes with responsibilities.”</ParaText><ParaText id="4122180">Here we have a minister of the crown, one of the government's chief legal ministers, directly contradicting the Supreme Court of Canada. In 1993, the Supreme Court found in the case of R. v. Hasselwander that: </ParaText><ParaText id="4122181"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Canadians, unlike Americans do not have a constitutional right to bear arms. Indeed, most Canadians prefer the peace of mind and sense of security derived from the knowledge that the possession of automatic weapons is prohibited.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4122182">Therefore, what the minister's comments last July clearly indicate is that we unfortunately have a government that likes to pander to this narrow gun lobby, and in this case the government does so fairly transparently in order to generate political support from their base.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4122183">The Conservatives like to talk about the Liberals doing mailings on gun registry and gun regulations, and they themselves do exactly the same. However, let me remind the House of a few of these initiatives regarding specific firearms regulations wherein the influence of the gun lobby is quite apparent.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122184">In 2011 the Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness drafted new regulations for gun shows that would have required things most Canadians would actually see as common sense, such as notifying local police of gun shows to be held in their jurisdiction and requiring tethering of guns on display just as is done with cellphones in sales kiosks. These gun show regulations would have been brought into force in 2012, but no, that did not happen. Instead, the Conservatives junked the proposed regulations altogether after complaints from the gun lobby that the new requirements would be too onerous. I guess we should have seen this coming when the gun-lobby-dominated firearms advisory committee called for the scrapping of gun show regulations in its March 2012 report.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122185">Regulations were also due to come into force in December 2012 to require each gun manufactured in Canada to have an individual serial number, something actually required by international treaties to which Canada is a party and again something that seems like common sense when it comes to police being able to trace guns used in crimes or in the fight to combat the illegal international trade in small arms. In November 2013, and for a second time, the Conservatives quietly implemented a regulation delaying the coming into force of this requirement until December 2015, after the next election.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122186">When it comes to Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document>, I guess we should be glad that the government abandoned the most extreme recommendations of its firearms advisory committee. These were the proposals for 10-year licences and proposals to allow the resale of seized weapons by police forces. We know that the police community very strongly opposed both of those measures, but now we are seeing complaints in the media from the narrow gun lobby that Bill C-42 does not go far enough in that direction.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122187">New Democrats have a different view, one that clearly puts public safety first. New Democrats believe that public safety must always trump politics when it comes to firearms licensing and regulation. The Conservatives like to pose as the ones who understand rural Canadians, but let me say that many MPs on our side also come from rural backgrounds—I am one of those—and many represent rural ridings. I myself represent a riding that stretches from downtown Victoria all the way out to the West Coast Trail trailhead at Port Renfrew, so I do know something about law-abiding gun owners for whom hunting is much more than just a prop to use in arguments about gun registration and licensing.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122188">Most curious, from a government that claims to put the interests of rural areas first when it comes to gun regulations, was the rejection of the NDP amendment proposed in the public safety committee to preserve the right of those in rural and remote areas to challenge the firearms exam without completing a safety course. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122189">Let us make no mistake about it: New Democrats support the requirement for completing a safety course. However, we acknowledge that there are vast areas of this country where these courses are simply not available on a practical basis. We are glad to see that the bill would preserve the exemption for aboriginal people, but we ask why the government rejected our proposals to accommodate other remote rural residents with a similar exemption.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122190">Let me turn back once again to the contents of the bill we have before us and make some of the arguments I made at second reading.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122191"> For me, despite the short title of the bill, there is nothing common sense about the bill's two major provisions: making gun classification a political process and removing the requirement for a transportation permit for restricted firearms to be present in any vehicle carrying them. These two proposals have no public safety purpose and instead respond to explicit complaints from the narrow gun lobby. All the other things the Conservatives want to address in this bill could have been accomplished without these two provisions.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122192"> Let me discuss the first change proposed, a change in the way weapons are classified as either non-restricted, restricted, or prohibited. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122193">Right now, recommendations on classification, under the definitions contained in law, are made by firearms experts from the RCMP. The minister's signature is required, but there is no discretion for the minister, providing the recommendations he receives fall within the scope of the existing legislative definitions. What is interesting is to hear the members on the other side say that bureaucrats made this decision and that bureaucrats could not be overruled by the minister. However, the existing legislative definition actually does allow the minister to overrule that recommendation for weapons that have a legitimate hunting or sporting purpose.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="00">(1600)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4122194">Why was the minister unable to overrule this reclassification? It was clearly because the Swiss Arms Classic Green does not have a legitimate hunting or sporting purpose once it is modified to be a semi-automatic weapon.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122195">What Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document> suggests is that cabinet should be able to ignore classification recommendations from the experts charged with keeping the public safe, the RCMP, and substitute its own wisdom about how weapons should be classified. The members on the other side say yes, the minister would be allowed to consult whomever he wants, and some Conservatives have even suggested that the proper people to consult would be gun manufacturers, who could advise cabinet on the classification of the weapons they are trying to sell.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122196">Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document> goes even further by allowing cabinet to grant exemptions for guns and ammunition that would otherwise be prohibited weapons. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122197">Where did this perceived need for change come from? It came from that single case that has been referred to, the reclassification of a single weapon, the Swiss Arms Classic Green, as it is sometimes called. These are military-style weapons that had originally been sold in Canada as a semi-automatic weapon limited to firing five rounds. Before 2013, there were approximately 2,000 of these in Canada, worth about $4,000 each. Why, then, were they reclassified? </ParaText><ParaText id="4122198">It came about because the RCMP found that so-called refurbished models were showing up in gun shops in Calgary, but they were now operating as automatic weapons. This meant these weapons were now being converted to automatic weapons capable of firing a long series of shots from a single trigger pull, exactly what the designation of “prohibited” was designed to keep off the streets in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122199">When an outcry resulted from this reclassification, the Conservatives were quick to grant a two-year amnesty in March 2014, an amnesty for which I believe the legal authority is doubtful at best. Now we have Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document> before us as the longer-term solution, since this bill would give the current Conservative cabinet the power to decide if these dangerous weapons should remain on our streets.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122200">Quite apart from the danger of ending up with automatic weapons on the street, there is another important principle at stake here. When we make laws, we make them in public, after public debate, and they stay in force until there is another public debate about changing them. In fact, what we have in this bill is the creation of a process whereby cabinet can in effect change our gun classification system and the classification of individual weapons and ammunition by making decisions behind closed doors and without any public debate. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122201">Who knows who will be serving in cabinet after the next election? Whoever that is, I know I do not want decisions to be based on political considerations, but instead on the professional recommendations of public officials charged with keeping Canadians safe.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122202">The other major change in Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document> is removing the requirement that exists in most provinces to have a permit in any vehicle transporting restricted firearms and prohibiting any province from reimposing such a requirement. Currently, permits must specify a reason for transporting a restricted firearm and specify that the travel must be from a specific point A to a specific point B. This makes it relatively easy for police to enforce the prohibition on the illegal transportation of firearms.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122203">Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document> rolls transportation permits into the licence to own firearms. This would automatically allow the transportation of firearms between the owner's home and a list of five categories of places: to any gun range, to any gun shop, to any gun show, to any police station, and to any border post for exiting Canada. In my riding alone, this would create hundreds of possibilities for those who wish to violate the law to make excuses for having the weapons in their vehicles, and this change would make the prohibition on the illegal transportation of weapons virtually impossible for police to enforce. Unfortunately, the committee did not hear from the law enforcement community, for a variety of reasons that I addressed earlier.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122204">There are other provisions in the bill about which New Democrats have questions. Members on the other side have raised the question of the grace period. I want to state once again that New Democrats have said that inadvertently forgetting to renew one's licence should not always result in a criminal record. However, the government has gone whole hog the other way and removed any penalties for people failing to renew their gun licences. We have suggested that if it is truly inadvertent, a lesser penalty than a criminal record could be imposed, but a penalty should still exist.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122205">Does anything in this bill look good to New Democrats? Certainly measures that make prohibitions on gun ownership easier in cases of domestic violence are welcome, as are the expanded requirements for gun safety courses.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4122206">Clearly, public safety is not the central priority for the Conservatives in Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document>. In fact, its two main provisions seem to pose new threats to public safety.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122207">Media interviews with the government's friends in the gun lobby have made several things clear. One is the close links between this narrow gun lobby and the Conservative Party, especially in terms of fundraising, as I mentioned, the other is that they will not be satisfied to stop with Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document>, and they intend to demand more in the future. This close relationship between the Conservatives and the gun lobby is why no one should trust the Conservatives any longer when it comes to putting public safety first on licensing gun owners and the regulations of guns. In the end, that really is the reason why we will be voting against this bill.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122208">We had a chance to have a full and fair debate here in Parliament. We had a chance to hear a full range of witnesses. The government had already decided that neither of those things was going to happen with this bill. As I said, it sat on the order paper from October and it is inexcusable to me that the government should then suddenly whip the bill through in such a short time. It needs full consideration. We need to hear from the law enforcement community about the impacts of this bill, and we need to hear from more Canadians and from disparate kinds of groups. The government did a good job in bringing hunting and fishing groups before the committee. They are legitimate stakeholders and we were glad to hear from them. However, hearing from just one side in this debate does not make for the best legislation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122209">The government accuses us on this side of fearmongering, and I guess we throw the same charge back at it. The fearmongering we are talking about is based on real concerns about public safety, so I would argue that fearmongering is not the right word. We are talking about what happens in many municipalities, in many cities around the country. We have the example of Surrey, B.C. where we have had a number of murders in that community, which I believe is now up to 25 in two months. There are very high levels of gun violence, so we have to make sure that any of the changes we make to a bill like Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document> do not inadvertently contribute to these high levels of violence. We have seen similar problems with gun violence in downtown Toronto. We see now in British Columbia the gun violence extending to the community of Abbotsford. It is like a cancer that spreads throughout the community. We have to do all we can to ensure that reasonable regulations, and the things that I talked about, such as having serial numbers on guns manufactured in Canada, are in place to help police officers do the work they need to do to keep our communities safe from gun violence. This is not just about hunters and fishers, although we do have to make sure that we have a law in place that is practical and reasonable for them. It is also about safety in our main communities. In this case, I would argue that the government has not found a balance, instead it has gone for one side of the debate only.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122210">What will the government say to families in Surrey? What will it say about the need to attack gun violence there? We heard the minister say in question period today that sometime in the future the government will provide more RCMP. He could not say exactly when, but that there would be money in the future. We have the government saying that the budget has been increased for the RCMP, for CBSA and for CSIS. However, when we actually look at the budget, as the minister invited me to do, we find that the level of cuts since 2012 will not even be made up for another four years. How do our law enforcement agencies cope with these epidemics of gun violence that are happening in urban areas?</ParaText><ParaText id="4122211">Because of the high level of resources required to meet terrorist threats, we have seen just this week that the RCMP has been forced to cut such programs as the Condor program, which targeted those offenders who left a halfway house or escaped custody and were illegally at large. There was a special task force to make sure that those people who belong behind bars end up back behind bars. However, the RCMP had to cut that due to a lack of funding.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122212">Once again we have come around full circle here for a government that likes to talk tough on crime but not provide the resources needed and, inadvertently, through its ideological approach to gun licensing and regulation, may actually make things worse in our urban areas.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122213"> Therefore, once again, the New Democrats will stand up and call for a gun licensing and regulation regime that puts public safety first, and that is not Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document>.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

What is the motivation behind the government bringing forward this bill?</ParaText><ParaText id="4122252"> It is interesting to note that back in 2014 the RCMP firearms program made a relatively quiet change to the status of the Swiss Arms brand rifles and certain Czech-made CZ858 rifles from non-restricted to prohibited. The guns had been legal in Canada for many years. A headline in the <I>Montreal Gazette</I> on August 30, 2014, read, “Conservatives restrict RCMP’s ability to reclassify firearms; Tories aim to woo gun enthusiasts”. There is a great deal of merit in what the article reported, which is one of the biggest flaws within the legislation proposed by the government today. It is politically motivated legislation, with which the government is trying to woo gun owners. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122253">The government has been fairly successful in trying to keep the issue of the gun registry alive, because it believes it is in its best political interest to do so. What seems to play second fiddle is the issue of crime and safety within our own communities. When Conservatives speak out on this issue, we often hear about the hunting, trapping and fishing industries, sport firing and things of this nature, and that is great. Again, I will provide some additional comment on that. However, we do not necessarily hear the other side. We do not hear about the importance of safety. There are aspects of the legislation that would touch upon that, but that is not necessarily what the government likes to highlight.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122254">Let me go through what the legislation proposes to do. It creates a six-month grace period at the end of that five-year licence period to stop people from immediately becoming criminalized for paperwork delays in licence renewals. That has already been talked about, and it has a great deal of merit.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122255"> The legislation would streamline the licencing system by eliminating the possession-only licence, known as the POL, and converting all existing POLs to possession and acquisition licences.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4122256">The legislation would make classroom participation in firearms safety training mandatory for first-time licence applicants.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122257"> On a couple of these points, I had the opportunity to not only to talk to a couple of individuals, because I anticipated I would be speaking to this legislation, but I also took advantage of visiting a hunting store to get a better sense of its take on the legislation. There are certain aspects of the legislation, especially around safety, in which there is a great deal of support, even from gun enthusiasts who want more gun control. Aspects of the legislation are supported from all sides.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122258">It would amend the Criminal Code to strengthen the provisions relating to orders prohibiting the possession of firearms where a person would be convicted of an offence involving domestic violence.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122259"> It would decrease needless paperwork around authorizations to transport by making them a condition of a licence for certain routine and lawful activities. Again, concerns have been raised in regard to that issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122260"> It would provide for discretionary authority of the chief firearms officer to be limited by regulation. Again, it is of great concern and I will provide further comment.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122261">The legislation would authorize firearms import information sharing when restricted and prohibited firearms were imported into Canada by business.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122262">Finally, from what I understand, it would also allow the government to have the final say on the classification decisions following the receipt of an independent expert's advice.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122263">It is very important at the beginning of the debate to state clearly that the Liberal Party cannot support the legislation as proposed. I think the government was already somewhat aware of the fact that opposition parties, particularly the Liberal Party, would have a great deal of difficulty in supporting the legislation. It is questionable whether it would make our communities safer. Certain aspects of the legislation do not make our communities safer. Therefore, it is very difficult for me as an individual and for the Liberal Party, if we put the safety of Canadians first and foremost, to support Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document>. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122264">The Liberal Party, through our critic, has been very vocal in recognizing that if the government truly wanted to do something positive with Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document>, it should have been prepared to allow the legislation to be broken into two parts. I suspect certain parts of the legislation would pass unanimously. It could have been passed quite a while ago. By not recognizing that, the government now finds itself in a position, as we have seen with a lot of legislation, where it continues to pass legislation through time allocation, or closure, to get its legislative agenda passed.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122265">Unfortunately, that limits debate for members of Parliament to contribute and share concerns of their constituents with regard to important legislation that ultimately impacts our communities, such as Winnipeg North and all regions of Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122266">It would eliminate the need for owners of prohibited and restricted firearms to have a transportation licence to carry those guns in their vehicles. This means they could freely transport handguns or automatic weapons anywhere within their province, whether it is to a grocery store or a soccer field. Members have made reference to the leader of the Liberal Party talking about a Canadian Tire store. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4122267">The government is trying to give the impression that an automatic weapon would be carried from a home, from a locked situation, to a vehicle and to the shooting range, with no stops in between. That is ridiculous. I do not believe there is any true merit for that.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122268"> I used to be the justice critic in Manitoba a number of years back. If we take a look at the amount of automobile thefts in the province of Manitoba, either in 2003 or 2004, I believe 14,000 vehicles were stolen in one year. That means we could take the total number of vehicles in any other province, on a per capita basis, and we would still find that Manitoba had double the rate of stolen cars than any other province.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122269">We aggressively pursued that issue and found that a large number of youth were stealing these vehicles. It was not uncommon to have one youth steal 30 vehicles in one year. We are not talking about a dozen; we are talking probably somewhere in the neighbourhood of a couple of hundred youth. It had a very profound impact.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122270">If we checked with people, and it did not matter which region of a province, there was a great deal of concern, but there was a bit more concern in certain areas. When we get those kinds of numbers and hear why cars are being stolen, it is a concern. To be a member of a gang, youth had to steal a certain number of vehicles as an initiation. The number of individuals getting involved in gang activities skyrocketed during the 2002-03 period. To get hard numbers is very difficult. I speculated that it could range anywhere from 1,500 to 3,000, which is a very high number considering the population base. Imagine the number of vehicles being stolen. Where are they being stolen from? Throughout all communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122271"> If we relax certain rules that allow for easier transportation of prohibited weapons, we should be concerned. I should express the concerns my constituents have on this legislation. They should be asking me and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> whether we are making our communities safer by passing the legislation that would allow easier transportation of automatic weapons and restricted weapons. That is one of the primary reasons why I am very grateful the Liberal Party has taken this position on the legislation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122272"> Often we will hear the Conservatives say that police officers or law enforcement officers are on their side. I have worked with community police officers. I sat as a chair of a youth justice committee for many years. The issues involved with respect to gangs are very serious in nature. Also, I suspect that Winnipeg is not alone, that we would find there are other pockets in other communities where there is a higher element of risk. I think all communities are very much concerned with this.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122273">I do not think we should take it as lightly as we have. Members say that it is just the “transportation of” or that people are are law-abiding citizens. Of course, they are law-abiding. Gun owners are law-abiding, wonderful citizens and they come from many different professions. However, they are not the ones who concern me and my constituents when it comes to violence or the potential risk of violence in our community.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4122274">It is also important to recognize that Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document> would take the power to classify firearms out of the hands of police, the experts in keeping Canada safe, and would put it in the hands of politicians. I am surprised that there has not been more comment on that issue. I know that the Liberal Party critic has had the opportunity to raise it on a number of occasions. This is a very serious issue. We have a government that likes to think that it knows better with respect to what should be a restricted or prohibited weapon. It wants to make this a political decision as opposed to relying on experts. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122275">I can recall having interviews on the changes in security here on the Hill and what the RCMP, local constables, and the fantastic security guards should be doing to ensure that we can protect the public, the staff, and members of Parliament. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122276">When I asked about security, it was a fairly straightforward response. In dealing with security, we should be turning to and relying on the experts. They bring something to the table that we do not have as elected officials. If there are issues in terms of certain decisions, there are ministerial departments. The opposition parties have critics. Nothing prevents them from picking up the phone, sending emails, or writing letters. There are many different avenues they can use to get a better understanding of why a decision was made. Who knows? It could ultimately end up with the reversal of a decision. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122277">Instead, what do we have? We have a <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who sees this as a win-win issue for him if he can bring in legislation and tell gun owners and lobbyists that the Conservatives stood tall for them. The government has not stood tall for us. It has disrespected the professional organizations, like the civil service, that understand. Will they make mistakes? At times, yes, but I can assure members that they will be fewer than the government's. Why would the government bring in legislation that would politicize it and allow the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> or the minister responsible to make decisions? I think that is wrong.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122278">Let me conclude by recognizing that law-abiding gun owners are in all different professions. Liberals recognize that. We recognize the valuable contributions of hunters, trappers, fishers, and sport shooters. These things create economic activity. It is a wonderful lifestyle. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122279">However, I will leave something with the government, and that is that there is another side to the debate. There is a safety element that needs to be talked about. Even though there are certain aspects of the legislation that are positive, if the government had brought them in as stand-alone legislation, they would have received the support of the Liberal Party of Canada. However, because of its attitude in trying to push the envelope and politicize the system, making our communities a little less safe in some ways, we cannot, in good conscience, support this legislation.</ParaText>

He probably is not aware that for any club one joins subsequent to that, one has to go through another safety course as well and pass it. He probably is not aware that the authorization to transport is already in effect. The only change we are talking about is that rather than having a permit for every kind of trip one needed to make, in other words for each individual club, there would just be one permit if a person decided to go to different clubs.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122283">However, what really troubled me is that he went on ad infinitum about a crime spree that happened in Manitoba, which was preceded by his notion that people would be driving around with their legal, locked firearms in their trunks and leaving their cars somewhere to be stolen. The reason this misrepresentation bothers me is that he mentioned all these cars that were stolen but never linked them to even one case of a legal firearm in any one of these cars that was stolen along with the car. The reason is that the vast majority, if not all, of the legal gun owners in this country understand the importance of making sure that they are with the vehicle all the time when they have an ATT, and they only drive it from home to a club.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

This is a fantastic step forward for law-abiding firearms owners across Canada and across Alberta. I am proud to be able to stand here today and support it. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122301">On behalf of the law-abiding firearms owners in my riding of Macleod, I would like to thank the <Affiliation DbId="194614" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness</Affiliation> for moving forward on this important legislation, and I would remiss if I did not thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="170247" Type="2">Yorkton—Melville</Affiliation>, from my home community. This member has carried the torch for years, standing up for the rights of law-abiding gun owners and against needless red tape.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122302">Today we have heard comments from many hunting and sport shooting groups from across Canada supporting this legislation. We have heard from the Canadian Police Association in support of this legislation. I have heard from residents across southern Alberta who are supporting this legislation. That is because it follows our Conservative government's views on firearms policies. These policies should be safe and they should be sensible. Overall, this bill continues our focus on pursuing common sense firearms legislation, something that has been lacking for far too long.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122303">The focus for my comments today will be answering some questions I have heard while discussing this important legislation with residents in Macleod as well as across Canada. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122304">Some have asked why these changes are being made now. As we have heard today, some of the people here in this House seem to believe this is pandering in advance of an election. This could not be further from the truth. This bill is not about somebody's hobby; it is about an important economic driver across this country. In fact, sport shooting and hunting is a billion-dollar industry in Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122305">It is also about a way of life, both in rural Canada and in urban Canada. There are literally millions of Canadians from all walks of life who enjoy participating in these heritage activities. For them, this is not something about a so-called gun lobby; this is about enjoying a treasured way of life.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122306">Some have also asked why we are combining different licences and giving new rights to possession-only licence holders. Some have also argued that the effect of this proposal would be that they would be required to take a mandatory safety training course. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122307">Let me be clear. This proposal would simplify the firearms licensing system by allowing experienced firearms owners to be able to purchase new firearms if they so choose. There would be no new training requirement for these individuals.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122308">This bill would also eliminate red tape by combining the PAL and POL licences. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122309">I have heard questions during the debate about why there should also be a six-month grace period at the end of the five-year firearms licence. This six-month grace period would protect law-abiding firearms owners from becoming paper criminals overnight as a result of an administrative error. I have already had several residents in my riding of Macleod bring up this issue just in the last few months. No other licence comes with as steep a penalty as a minimum of three years in prison for forgetting to renew. That is why this change is so important. It would allow time for individuals to come back into compliance with the law.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122310">Some have asked why we would mandate a base standard for firearms safety training. Should not those who can pass the test simply be allowed to get their firearms licence? </ParaText><ParaText id="4122311">We believe there is no substitute for learning in a classroom. Firearms safety is extremely important. I think all of my colleagues in the House would agree with that statement. Canadians understand firearms safety is essential to owning a firearm, which is why four out of five applicants for a firearms licence already take advantage of available training.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122312"> As a result of an authorization to transport being made a condition of a restricted licence, some people have asked whether it would be a requirement of getting a licence to be a member in good standing of a shooting club or shooting range. The clear answer to this is no. There would be no requirement in law for individuals to maintain a membership at a gun range in order to transport their restricted firearms.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122313">The reforms contained in this bill are safe and sensible. They strike an appropriate balance between tackling the criminal use of firearms and removing red tape for law-abiding citizens. Unfortunately, our Conservative government is the only one that will stand up for law-abiding hunters, farmers, and sport shooters. We have seen all too well that the Liberal Party still embodies the comments made by former justice minister Allan Rock, who said he came to Ottawa with the firm belief that only police and the military should have guns.</ParaText>

They are trying to connect the common sense firearms licensing act to criminal activity. I do not care what argument they have, because I could probably find less than 1% of criminals who actually have a firearms licence and have an authorization to transport. They are certainly not going to do those things. To be connecting the common sense firearms licensing act to a rash of criminal activity is just absolutely false.

I am, of course, referring to Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document>, the common sense firearms licensing act. This legislation will, among other things, remove needless paperwork around the authorization to transport restricted and prohibited firearms and the arbitrary powers of chief firearms officers, and give elected government the final say over firearms classification decisions.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122336">I would like to take this opportunity today to clarify some falsehoods, mistruths and inaccuracies that have been put forth by Liberals and New Democrats over the course of the debate on this legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122337">First, the Liberals put out an advertisement to try to bolster their sub-par fundraising numbers, which claimed that under the bill, the sky would fall and there would be handguns in the trunks of all cars at shopping malls and grocery stores from coast to coast. We all know this is nonsense. There are clear locations where restricted firearms can be taken that are laid out in the regulations under the Firearms Act, and anyone who has read the bill knows that those do not change. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122338">However, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170598" Type="2">Yukon</Affiliation> did his due diligence. During committee study of this important bill, he asked the Assistant Deputy Minister for Community Safety and Countering Crime, a non-partisan public servant, if the Liberal advertisement was accurate, and her response was no. We all know the penchant of bureaucrats for speaking in circles. That is pretty clear and simply condemnation of the leader of the Liberal Party and his inaccurate material. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122339">We also heard from the Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="207341" Type="2">Trinity—Spadina</Affiliation> making a moral equivalency between hunters and terrorists. This type of ridiculous hyperbole would be offensive if we did not consider the source. This was the very same member who had previously called for a ban on the sale of bullets as a solution to gun crime. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122340">Let us look at the facts. Based on the evidence from Statistics Canada, Canadians are 26 times more likely to die from a slip and fall than a firearms accident or homicide. They are 24 times more likely to die from a car accident, three times more likely to die while swimming, and equally as likely to die in a bicycle accident as a death involving firearms. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122341">Clearly the Liberals do not have the ability to set appropriate priorities when balancing private property rights against public safety. Perhaps a ban on bicycles would be the next big Liberal policy.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122342">When we talk about factual inaccuracies, New Democrats do not fare much better. First, the leader of the NDP has said that he would bring back the wasteful and ineffective long gun registry. He even said that he wanted to track every firearm in Canada. This is despite the fact that the NDP member for <Affiliation DbId="170184" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> was very clear when he said that the NDP would never bring forward measures to require registration of shotguns and rifles.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122343">Rural Canadians want to know who is it who really speaks for New Democrats, because they seem to have different messages in downtown Ottawa and Montreal than they do in rural Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122344">It is not only confusion in their own ranks that New Democrats suffer from. They seem to also have a disconnect with reality. The NDP member for <Affiliation DbId="170462" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</Affiliation> said a number of times that the <Affiliation DbId="194614" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness</Affiliation> personally authorized the reclassification of the Swiss Arms and CZ-858 rifles. This is clearly inaccurate. However, I wanted to take the time to do the due diligence. I looked up the database of all orders in council, and I could not find a single one pertaining to this one.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4122345"> Clearly, what occurred is a unilateral reclassification by the Canadian firearms program, with no notice to elected officials. It is important that we change this immediately as it flies in the face of democratic principles. These unfortunate comments were made by the same member who berated two expert witnesses in the public safety committee before ending his tirade with, “Well, I'm not sure there's any point in continuing to ask you any questions, then, if you're right on everything you've already said to us.” It is clear that there is an anti-gun bias across the aisle. These people simply will not rest until they have prohibited all firearms in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122346">However, it seems that the NDP and Liberals continue to believe that hunting and sport shooting are the remit of backward rural folks. The fact of the matter is that they are wrong. A low estimate puts about four million Canadians being involved in these activities each year.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122347">I will quote Greg Farrant with the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters, who said before the public safety committee:</ParaText><ParaText id="4122348"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Firearms owners in Canada are judges, lawyers, farmers, electricians, mechanics, plumbers, accountants, even federal politicians,...[who] live in and represent urban ridings. They are not criminals. They are not gang members. Rather, they are lawful firearms owners who obey the law.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122349">However, it is clear that the message has not yet sunk in across the aisle. Some Liberal and NDP members have taken the debate on firearms issues as an opportunity to engage in a drive-by smear of outdoor enthusiasts by saying that those who want to be able to obey clear rules are part of an American-style gun lobby or are advocating for a return to, as one NDP member from Quebec said, the wild west gun laws. This is patently ridiculous and offensive to the millions of law-abiding Canadian gun owners. However, they will hear from their constituents in a few short months from now on whether there is support for safe and sensible measures, such as the bill before us today.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122350">I look forward to telling my constituents why I support cutting red tape on law-abiding Canadians.

One of those characteristics is that it is subject to a time allocation motion, which was moved as quickly as possible after the bill was introduced, thereby depriving many members of their right to speak in the House and especially of the right to make the voices of their constituents heard. In order to allow as many people as possible to participate in this debate, I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="170401" Type="2">Alfred-Pellan</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122363">Some things that characterize this government are the many in camera meetings and the rush jobs that are done in committee, and this also seems to be the case with Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document>. Something that seems odd to me and that I am having trouble understanding is that the previous speaker, to whom I asked a question, said right away in his answer that the bill was not perfect. Perfection may be difficult if not impossible to achieve, but that makes it even more difficult to understand another characteristic of how this government does things, and that is the fact that the government does not accept any amendments. If the government already knows that its bill is not perfect and that the role of every opposition member is to try to improve the bill, since we are not in charge of the legislative agenda, then it is strange that the government hardly ever accepts any of the amendments proposed for any of its bills.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122364">Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document>, introduced by the <Affiliation DbId="194614" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness</Affiliation>, is sadly reminiscent of some of this government's signature approaches. I want to mention a few others, which have unfortunately become classics. These include systematically using wedge politics, for example, by dividing rural and urban Canadians on sensitive issues such as firearms, as though these two groups should be at odds with each other, which is not the case. Another classic—and I am making an assumption here, but I want to mention it anyway because it seems increasingly obvious—is attempting to use public safety issues to camouflage their lack of economic vision or, at the very least, their poor economic performance in spite of a vision that we could debate at length. Obviously, the third classic is seeking to satisfy the interests of lobbyists at the expense of the public interest.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122365">I would perhaps even add a fourth Conservative classic: their unquestionable ability to choose short titles for their bills. It is hard to be even more sarcastic when the short title in this case is the common sense—I would even say simplistic—firearms licensing act. I would not be surprised if the gun lobby itself named this bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122366">I oppose Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document>, which means that I also oppose the culture of fear, the divisiveness and the Manichaeism that the Conservatives seek to implant in each of their initiatives. By trying to politicize the firearms issue at all costs, the Conservatives are completely missing the mark. The bill would give firearms owners who may have forgotten to renew their licence a six-month grace period. Very well. I agree that this can happen to anyone. I once forgot to renew my driver's licence. I paid the fees. I was not sent to prison and did not get a criminal record, but I got a fine reminding me of my duty as a citizen.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122367">This legislative provision disregards the most basic principles of public safety. Let us not forget that this grace period will deprive police services of information on gun owners for six months. Every time an owner renews his firearms licence, the process requires evaluations to detect mental health problems. By identifying psychological issues, the process prevents risky behaviour by some firearms owners. However, the six-month grace period short-circuits the effectiveness of that preventive evaluation and could put our fellow citizens' safety at risk.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4122368">By instituting this potentially harmful measure, the Conservatives are showing their desire to satisfy a minority represented by lobbyists at the expense of the public interest. However, winning political points seems to be one of the main goals of this government's legislative agenda.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122369">As I continued to study this bill, I nevertheless gleaned what was probably, in any event, the only good provision in Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document>. The bill would require each applicant to take the Canadian firearms safety course. I was just about to applaud, but I held back as I thought it was too good to be true. As I continued reading I found out that I was right. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122370">This course would be given by an instructor designated by a provincial chief firearms officer, whose powers are constantly being eroded. Although the fact that the bill requires this course proves that all is not lost and that we can hope for signs that we are making progress with this government, we must recognize that the Conservatives' goodwill is quite limited, since this course, the only course, will not be readily available to people living in rural or remote areas. Once again, we run up against the Conservatives' old habits in the legislation, which we might call a legislative mirage rather than a legislative measure. Furthermore, Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document> weakens the current legislation that governs the transport of firearms. No one should trust the Conservatives when it comes to implementing the necessary security measures for firearms.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122371">Let us not forget that under the current provisions, firearms owners are required to have authorization to transport to carry their firearms. Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document> makes it possible for owners to get the authorization to transport as soon as they receive their licence. As soon as someone receives their licence, the authorization to transport is automatically issued. There again the Conservatives are demonstrating their will to dismantle weapons transport regulations and potentially harm public safety just to please a voter base. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122372">This measure will have its share of adverse effects because it will make it easier to transport prohibited and restricted firearms. Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document> will truly cause problems for police forces in their fight against the unauthorized transport of firearms. That is why any change to the Firearms Act has to be done carefully and with the primary goal of improving public safety, a goal that was far from met according to my reading of this bill.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122373">Since deregulating the transportation of firearms does not even remotely satisfy the gargantuan appetite of some lobbyists, the Conservatives are now wondering why they should not go even further and tackle the firearms classification standards. To carry out their agenda, the Conservatives stuck to their pattern of centralizing, another tactic that this government has used over and over from the beginning: concentrate the powers in the hands of the minister. With Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document>, Public Safety could have the power to set the definitions and classifications of firearms.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122374">I cannot believe I have so little time, but I assume that is because I agreed to share my speaking time. I will wrap things up, since I am running out of time, but I still want to briefly recap the reasons why I oppose this bill. Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document> embodies the Conservatives' philosophy of taking a simplistic and strictly election-minded view of problems. The main objective of this bill is to pander to a minority of firearms owners for whom safety is an afterthought.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122375">True to form, the Conservatives are driving a wedge between Canadians in different communities. I urge all members to vote against this dangerous and ineffective bill. </ParaText>

If you dig a little deeper into Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document> and really look at the various provisions, you see that, basically, the issue of firearms in Canada is being politicized to some degree.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122393">What is coming out of this debate and the positions the Conservatives are taking on the issue is really the politics of dividing Canadians in the various regions of Canada. It is pretty sad to hear the Conservatives brag about being the great defenders of public safety. They should have rallied people around the debate on the firearms legislation and held proper consultations. That is what is missing.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122394">Since my time is quite limited, I will quickly focus on the key points of Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122395">I consulted various groups of experts. I also consulted various police associations to get their take on Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document>. The first thing that came up was the lack of consultation on the issue. In fact, most police forces were informed after the fact about what the Conservative government wanted to include in its firearms legislation. I think that is terrible, given that the government is talking about public safety and wants the support of the polices forces that have to enforce these laws.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122396">I consulted various police departments, in Quebec in particular. They told me about their concerns regarding Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document>. One of the main concerns has to do with the transportation of firearms. At present, anyone who wants to transport prohibited or restricted firearms to or from a club, shooting range, police station, gun shop, gun show, or port of exit from Canada must have a prescribed route when authorized to transport prohibited or restricted firearms. Unfortunately, these provisions will be eliminated by Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document>. The authorizations will be automatically given with the firearms licence, which greatly complicates the work of police officers across the country. The Conservative government would know this had it consulted our police forces.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122397">The second major concern is the classification of firearms. I feel that there is a serious flaw. Quite frankly I am disappointed with the federal government. At present, non-restricted, restricted and prohibited firearms and ammunition are classified under the RCMP's Canadian Firearms Program. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4122398">Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document> will give cabinet a new power, namely, the power to circumvent the definitions of the classifications of firearms set out in section 84 of the Criminal Code through a regulation that provides for exceptions. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122399">If that is not politicizing the debate, then I do not know what is. Determining which firearms will be restricted, prohibited or non-restricted is extremely important and it should be done with the help of experts. The people who are appointed to cabinet, regardless of which party is in power, are often highly qualified, but not necessarily in this area. I am really concerned about the government politicizing this debate, because no matter who is in power, they will have the authority to decide how weapons should be classified.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122400">Right now the classification system is working, although it could still be improved. The RCMP manages the system, but the Minister of Public Safety still has to approve any classifications.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122401">I therefore do not know exactly where the Conservatives are going with this or what the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has decided to do and what he is telling his colleagues. However, this government is clearly playing divisive politics with this issue. I know that I use the word “deplorable” a lot, but I find this particular situation completely deplorable. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122402">I attended the various hearings that were held with regard to Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document>. Many things were said about the bill, but what stood out the most was the lack of consultation. I always talk about Quebec because that is where I am from. My riding of Alfred-Pellan is very close to Montreal. About 80% of the land is agricultural even though it is located on the the island of Laval. We are very close to a very urban area. We have some small, very urbanized areas, but the riding is also quite rural. I am proud to represent such a region. What I am not proud of right now is how the Conservative government is using bills like the one before us today to try to divide Canadians by pitting people living in urban areas against those living in rural areas.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122403">What bothers me the most is that once again, Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document> ignores what Quebec wants. The government did not even consult the Government of Quebec on this. It simply informed the province after the fact. The minister responsible for Canadian intergovernmental affairs said:</ParaText><ParaText id="4122404"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> This flies in the face of the notion of public safety, the safety of citizens. I think there is a huge disconnect when I hear the federal government say that it is doing this in the name of public safety...</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4122405">It is rare that I agree with the Liberals, but I have to say that I completely agree with what Mr. Fournier said. I would have liked to see the federal government take its leadership seriously and consult the provinces and territories on a bill as important as this one. The government tried to make it seem as though it was not important and it was just removing some things that should have been gone a long time ago. However, when we look carefully at Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document>, we can see that, on the contrary, this bill should have received very broad consultation, so that there was no divisiveness on this particular bill.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122406">I would like to emphasize another point about granting licences. Various police forces I consulted also made this point. This licence can be renewed every five years. The Conservative government wants to permanently create a six-month grace period. Once again, this further complicates the problem that police forces in Quebec and the rest of Canada are dealing with.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122407">I see that my time is almost up. I will endeavour to answer questions from colleagues on both sides of the House as well as I can, but I have to say that I cannot vote in favour of Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document>. The policies in it are far too divisive. Once again, the Conservatives are going it alone. They are trying to politicize the debate, an attitude that I utterly deplore.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

They have received this treatment simply for enjoying the Canadian heritage activities of hunting, sport shooting, or simply living off the land.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122422"> In fact, former Liberal cabinet minister Allan Rock even said when he came to Ottawa that he came with the firm belief that the only people in Canada who should have firearms are police officers and the military. What a slap in the face for the rural parts of this country.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122423">Our Conservative government could not disagree more with Allan Rock. We believe there should be laws in place to combat the criminal use of firearms, but we also believe that one should not need a law degree to engage in a hobby that is as old as Canada itself.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122424"> In other words, we believe in safe and sensible firearms policies. That is why we have taken action to get tough on gang members who are illegally in possession of a firearm. It is also why we have made sentences tougher for those who use firearms to commit crimes. That is why we have made it a specific offence to engage in drive-by or other reckless shootings.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122425">It is also why we scrapped the wasteful and ineffective long gun registry. It is why we have taken needless regulations off the books. It is also why we are here today to discuss this important common sense piece of legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122426"> I would like to discuss some of the key measures that the bill advances. We will simplify the licensing system by eliminating the possession only licence and converting to a possession and acquisition licence. This will, upon royal assent, give 600,000 people in this country the ability to purchase firearms. That is good news for law-abiding gun owners and good news for business in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122427">Further, the bill would provide for a six-month grace period at the end of a five-year licence. This would allow individuals who forget to renew their licence to come back in compliance with the law without fear of becoming a criminal simply for making a mistake.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122428">Additionally, the bill would require first-time gun owners to participate in a Canadian firearms safety course and pass that test. Members might think this has always been the case, but previously individuals did not have to participate in a class in order to get their licence. We believe it is important that all gun owners have a solid understanding of how to handle their firearms safely.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122429">Some have said that this will lead to those who have held a possession only licence for many years to have to take this course in order to receive their new converted licence. It is absolutely not true, not intended, and is not the case.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122430">What is more, the bill would end the needless paperwork surrounding the authorization to transport restricted firearms. Rather than requiring endless forms and red tape, the bill would effectively make a gun owners licence also the authorization to transport. Some have raised concerns that this provision will lead to some sort of concealed carry notion, which is also absolutely not true. All safe handling procedures will remain in place, such as disabling the unloaded firearm and placing it in a locked container prior to transporting it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122431">In addition, the bill would end the arbitrary and discretionary authority of chief firearms officers in Canada. Firearms laws should be applied consistently across Canada. There should not be discrepancies between one province to another. It is ineffective and causes a lot of confusion for law-abiding citizens of this country. Unelected officials should not be making decisions that potentially impact the property rights of millions of Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122432">On top of that, the bill would end the problem of arbitrary and unfair reclassification of firearms, which we saw as recently as in the last couple of years. Last February, thousands of Canadians were rendered criminals overnight by a mere stroke of some bureaucrat's pen. There was not one elected official who had been consulted about this decision. Our government disagrees with the decision specifically, and also disagrees with this process generally. That is why this bill would give the elected government an oversight mechanism to reverse ill-considered classification decisions made by bureaucrats.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="50">(1750)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4122433">Lastly, the bill would strengthen the Criminal Code provisions related to firearms prohibition orders. When someone is convicted of a serious domestic violence offence, they would automatically be barred from possessing firearms. There is a sound reason for that. According to police-reported data, in 2011 there were almost 95,000 victims of family violence in Canada, accounting for one-quarter of all victims of police-reported violent crimes. Between 2000 and 2010, two-thirds of spouses accused of homicide had a family history of violence involving the victim. That is why this bill is so important. It would reduce red tape for law-abiding hunters, farmers, and sport shooters, but it would also refine our gun control system, making it more effective and more sensible.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122434">We have heard where the other parties stand. The Liberal leader has said that if he had to vote again today, he would vote to keep the wasteful and ineffective long gun registry. The Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="207341" Type="2">Trinity—Spadina</Affiliation> said that emotional reasons from firearm advocates was not enough evidence to continue to allow ammunition to be sold to the Canadian public. The NDP leader has been clear about his desire to bring back the long gun registry, recently calling the data contained therein “useful data”. However, he seems to know that Canadians from the west and the north have no time for such bureaucratic schemes. Speaking in the Yukon, the NDP leader said that he would not consider bringing back the registry. Which is it? I guess that depends on who the leader is talking to: the press gallery here in Ottawa, or the average everyday citizen of the west or the north.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122435">It is about making firearms policies safe and sensible. It is about good old-fashioned common sense. I am proud to stand up to support this legislation, and I hope every member of this House will do the same. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122436">Canada is a large and diverse country with a historic background of hunting, angling, and outdoor life.

We heard a lot of things from witnesses, and one of the things that stood out for me was some testimony from Greg Farrant, who represents the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters. Mr. Farrant is tuned in, clearly, to a lot of the debate that has gone on with the bill. He understood what was going on and in fact provided testimony as the government was introducing legislation to get rid of the long gun registry.</ParaText>

He said that we always get branded, and I say “we”, because I come from a long, proud tradition and history of hunting. I grew up in the Yukon territory doing that as a wonderful way of life as well and will well into my future. I say “we” in that sense.

We say it with pride, and we say it with the understanding, on this side of the House, of what exactly the gun lobby represents in Canada. It is not the negative, pejorative term that anyone should hide their head from and be ashamed of. What does that gun lobby do? That gun lobby participates in hunting heritage activities. It contributes millions of dollars to conservation in this country. In fact, a recent study from the United States indicates that the group four times more likely than any other group to put their sweat equity and their cash into conservation is the hunting group. That is right. Hunters are four times more likely than any other group to put their money, their time, and their effort into the valuable principles of conservation. That is something they should be applauded for.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122461">Instead, in return, what the opposition does is call them the gun lobby, as though that is some sort of evil moniker they should hide from and have a shadow over them for.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122462"> I say that they need to stand and be proud of that one simple fact. They are the ones out there on the land. They are the ones who first recognized the need for the protection and preservation of our environmental heritage. They are the ones who recognize the depletion or the need for conservation practices and principles in a particular area or a particular region for a particular species. It is not only the species they hunt. It is the species, the streams, the habitats, the lakes, and the forests that contribute to the life processes of the wildlife populations in our country. Those people are the ones who are responsible for the abundance, the protection, and the preservation of the wildlife, lakes, land, and water in our nation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122463"> There is no accidental abundance of wildlife in Canada. There is no accidental protection and preservation of the wilderness. There is no accidental protection and preservation of the lakes, rivers, and streams in this country.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122464">How does that happen? Where does that come from? It is from the gun lobby: the hunters, the anglers, the trappers, the sport shooters, and the athletes, the people who own guns and carry guns and spend time in the wilderness.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122465">Where do we get our safety laws from? We did not create them here in the House of Commons, did we? No. Anyone who owns a gun in this country knows, as ethical, safe, law-abiding people in Canada, that they were the first to promote and teach safe ways of handling firearms. They were the ones who developed the 10 rules of firearms safety that those on the other side of the House could not list three of but that probably 90% of the members on this side of the House know inside and out, as though they are a bible to us. They were created by the hunting community and not by politicians.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122466"> We can thank the gun lobby. We can thank the conservationists. We can thank the hunters, the trappers, the sport shooters, and the athletes in the country who use firearms in a safe, responsible, and ethical way every single day in this country for the fundamental rules we now call laws.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4122467">Is it not ironic that we are here standing up to defend, change, or alter the very laws that this community itself generated? That is because it understands that firearms come with responsibilities. They are a tool to protect and preserve an important way of life, but they do come with responsibilities. It was those groups, not the House of Commons and not the provincial legislatures, that first created those laws. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122468">I am proud to talk about the measures we are taking in Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document> to ensure that those people who created those laws and do so much for the conservation, preservation, and protection of a great way of life in this country are not burdened by red tape that is unnecessary, are not considered criminals at first blush, and are not considered criminals because of paperwork errors. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122469">Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document> will merge the possession and POL licences to give people more opportunities to own firearms, to simplify things, and to reduce some of the red tape. It will merge some of the ATT conditions in just one licence so that there is a condition for that licence instead of a whole bunch of other papers of authorization, which can inadvertently trip people up and in fact make it more difficult for law enforcement to determine whether a person is in legal possession of a restricted firearm when he or she is going to and from a range. The bill contains sensible measures so that people can transport firearms to shooting ranges, gun shops, a police station, or a point of entry, all things they could do in the past but that can now all be on one licence instead of multiple licences.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122470">Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document> will also take another step to balance responsible firearm ownership and public safety. It will introduce stricter penalties for people convicted of domestic violence and stricter conditions for people involved in violent behaviour and violent activity. Who asked for that? It is the gun lobby, the firearms community, those responsible gun owners. They are every bit as offended, if not more offended, by the illegal and unlawful use of firearms as anyone in this House could possibly be, because it affects that community greatly when someone steps out of line or uses a firearm in an illegal and inappropriate manner. That is not what they taught long before we put laws in place, and it is not what they teach in the present day. Of course they are supportive of the stricter public safety measures we are putting in place. At the same time, they do not want to be treated as criminals for simple paperwork errors. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122471">The bill will reduce red tape and formalize some of the provisions that did not have clear guidelines before, such as the rules and regulations around the determination of what the CFOs can do. Arbitrary decisions were being made from one province to the next that left everyone in a state of confusion, because they were not clear-cut. This legislation will make clear what CFOs can do and what terms and conditions they can and cannot put in place so that firearms owners, the general public, and the law enforcement community have certainty and we do not see decisions like the one made by a CFO in Ontario, who arbitrarily decided that any firearms owner wanting to go to a range with a restricted weapon needed an invitation from another range. That was not spelled out in any piece of legislation at all. It was an invention of a CFO. Clearly, firearms owners need to know what is a reasonable restriction and a reasonable condition on their licence that cannot be made up. This bill will provide that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122472">I will leave members with this thought. One in every five Canadians participates in hunting, trapping, and sport shooting activities in this country. They contribute $15.5 billion to the Canadian economy. This side of the House, this party, and this government will stand up for law-abiding firearms owners every single day. While I would like to encourage the members of the opposition to get on board and help support these measures in Bill <Document DbId="6714626" Type="3">C-42</Document>, it was clear from their testimony at committee that they have no intention of doing that, which is all the better for us. We will be the party that stands up for law-abiding firearms owners.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

St-Pierre-Jolys has an opportunity to add 300 people, 150 homes, to its community. The trouble is that the waterworks of the town has already passed capacity. It currently has capacity for 800 people but actually has 1,000 people in the community. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122542">It is looking to grow. This is critically important. It is a francophone town in southeastern Manitoba. It needs critical mass to sustain services in French. If it is not allowed to grow and sustain its population base and add jobs and opportunities that providing 150 new homes would create in that community, much is at stake. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122543">Therefore, the town is looking to its federal member and the federal government for infrastructure money, but instead of getting a response what they get are a couple of answers. First, it is a big announcement, but none of the money is available for 10 years. Second, the water services it wants to provide need to be changed and upgraded in order to meet new federal standards. The problem with that is that there is no money in this budget earmarked for water services in small communities, or even large communities, despite the fact that the federal government has actually changed the specifications for cities right across the country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122544">We have small towns with the capacity to grow. We have small towns that have urgent needs around water infrastructure. We have an infrastructure fund that is back-end loaded and much of the money will not even arrive until after the next election, forget this election, yet it keeps telling people in these small communities not to worry, that there is money on the table. There was not even a desk to apply to up until late last fall. A year ago, when the town wanted to apply for infrastructure funding, it could not apply. There had not been a provincial and a federal agreement put in place. There is no money earmarked for this now. There will be no dollars set aside for it. Federal standards have changed and this community, which is trying to grow, which has the capacity to grow, is being frustrated because it has no federal partner willing to step up.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122545">My question is very simple. Why has this budget, which we have just voted on, refused to put dollars on the table for small municipalities and towns to upgrade their water facilities so they can grow and provide clean and safe drinking water?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Since 2006, our government has dramatically increased the average annual federal funding for thousands of provincial, territorial and municipal infrastructure projects across the country. We are building on Canada's historic investments with $80 billion for public infrastructure over the next 10 years, including the $53-billion new building Canada plan for provincial, territorial and municipal infrastructure. As Canada's largest and longest federal infrastructure plan, the new building Canada plan provides predictable and flexible funding so that municipalities from coast to coast to coast can address their most pressing infrastructure priorities and plan for the long term.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122547"> Our new building Canada plan ensures support through a number of different funds. The federal gas tax fund supplies almost $2 billion in federal funding per year. Since 2006, our Conservative government has extended, doubled, indexed and made the gas tax fund permanent through legislation. We have also expanded its eligible categories so that it covers a wider range of types of projects. Further, municipalities can pool, bank and borrow against this gas tax funding.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122548">Another major component of the plan is the new building Canada fund, made up of the national infrastructure component for projects of national significance. The provincial-territorial infrastructure component has dedicated funding for provinces and territories. Under the provincial-territorial infrastructure component, each Canadian province and territory receives a base amount, plus a per capita allocation over the 10 years of the program.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122549">Not only are the new building Canada plan programs well under way, over $6 billion in public infrastructure funding continues to flow from the original plan and other federal programs to support infrastructure projects across the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122550">Canadian municipalities, including those in Manitoba, have unprecedented ways in which they can put the federal funding to work in their communities. Through the plan, Manitoba will benefit from almost $1.2 billion in dedicated federal funding, including almost $476 million under the new building Canada fund, and an estimated $713 million under the federal gas tax fund.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122551">The new building Canada plan has been open for business since March 2014, and programs are well under way. We are working with the provinces and the territories to identify projects, and we are processing proposals as quickly as they come in. In fact, more than $6 billion in total project costs have already been announced under the new program, and we look forward to announcing many more projects in 2015.</ParaText>

It is $625 million.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122555">While the member talks about money being available, there is a $440-billion infrastructure deficit in this country, 60% of which is controlled by and under the responsibility of municipalities. Putting in an extra $5 billion is a drop in the bucket. The trouble is, because we are talking about clean drinking water, it is not drinkable water that is going into that bucket.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122556">We need an infrastructure plan that deals with small towns and water supplies, we need it critically and we need it immediately. None of the programs that were just listed address that issue. Transit money does not build water plants. Housing money does not build water plants.

Canada's economic success depends on smart and strategic investment in infrastructure programs.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122562">Unfortunately, the Conservative government has allowed Canadian infrastructure to crumble and decay, including by ignoring Ontario, our country's industrial heartland, in favour of subsidizing the energy sector in Alberta.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122563">Ontario pays 39% of all federal revenues but receives only 34% of federal program dollars. My riding of Thunder Bay—Superior North in northern Ontario represents a vast and remote region. However, our region's economy faces unique challenges and threats. Unemployment rates are high, commodity prices are falling, forestry continues to suffer, tourism has fallen without adequate federal marketing, exports have decreased, and there are no roads or power lines to most remote first nations communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122564">The economic growth rate in Canada from 2006 to now, under the Conservatives, has fallen to a miniscule 1.77%, the lowest growth rate since 1930. The wrong economist is running Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122565"> The IMF estimates that Canada pays out an astonishing $34 billion a year in subsidies and untaxed externalities to the fossil fuel industries. That is $34 billion a year to some of the wealthiest corporations in Canada, while total investments in infrastructure, the building block of our economy, are receiving only a quarter as much, at about $7.5 billion a year.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122566">The population of Canada is 35 million. That means, if we do the math, a whopping $952, or almost $1,000, per year in energy subsidies from every Canadian to the oil sector. On average, every Canadian was taxed—it is really a tax—$952 in 2014 to subsidize big oil. This is on top of the payments we make through our energy bills. David Lipton of the IMF explains that removing these subsidies worldwide could lead to a 13% decline in C0<Sub>2</Sub> emissions.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122567"> Infrastructure monies to municipalities have gone down significantly under the Conservatives. Budgetary holdups meant that some Canadian cities are likely to be receiving no infrastructure funding for the third year in a row.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122568"> FedNor has steadily decreased its funding to various programs in northern Ontario, despite increased applications for funding. Those applications are held up, stuck on his desk, by the minister from Kenora, who puts his party before his communities and his constituents.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122569"> What could Canada do with an extra $34 billion a year? We could build about 140 kilometres of badly needed urban subway lines every year, or we could build about 560 kilometres of light rail transit.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122570"> Canada's infrastructure deficit of crumbling roads, rusting rail, and outdated water and sewage treatment is pegged at $171 billion in backlog. That huge backlog could, and would, be wiped out in five years with the revenue we are subsidizing to the oil, coal, and gas sectors, but our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has refused repeatedly to even meet with the premiers to discuss it.</ParaText>

This includes the $53 billion new Building Canada plan, the largest and longest federal infrastructure plan in our country's history. The plan was designed following extensive consultation with our partners. It provides flexible and predictable federal funding in support of infrastructure projects of national, regional, and local significance, and it is made up of a number of different funds.</ParaText>

Not only have we expanded its eligible categories to support a greater variety of projects, but our government has also extended it, doubled it, indexed it, and legislated it as a permanent source of federal infrastructure funding.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122576">Moreover, municipalities can pool, bank, and borrow against this funding, allowing them more flexibility in addressing their local needs. Municipalities, including Thunder Bay, can count on the federal gas tax fund.

Though implemented in this year's budget, it is the culmination of many years' work. It is a plan laid out in the worst days of the great recession. In those dark days, we spent billions to create jobs when Canadians needed them most.</ParaText>

							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4122655">However, for such a plan to work, a plan involving billions of dollars over many years, a key ingredient is needed: resolve. When I think of resolve, I recall John Diefenbaker, a great Conservative and a great prime minister. Few men could match his resolve and his devotion to the public. He devoted time to reading letters from ordinary Canadians and writing to them in turn. To those he disagreed with, he was polite.

His resolve has been ironclad. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122659">That was a necessity because when we promised to balance the budget, there were many naysayers. “They cannot do it”, the naysayers said, and “Even if they can, they should not”. However, we did it. Upon the extraordinary foundation of the Canadian advantage, we have built one more advantage, a balanced budget.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122660"> That Canadian advantage flows from the success of Canada's economic action plan, and the evidence of that success is abundant. Canada has demonstrated one of the best economic performances among G7 countries over the recovery. Over 1.2 million more Canadians are working now than at the end of the recession. The majority of these jobs have been full-time, high-wage, and in the private sector. Canada has posted one of the strongest job performances in the G7. The IMF and OECD expect Canada's growth, already ahead of its peers over the recovery, to continue to be solid. We have absolutely the top credit rating from all of the major credit rating agencies.</ParaText>

Kevin Sorenson (Minister of State (Finance), CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4122742">Mr. Chair, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak here this evening, and highlight our government's record of supporting Canada's seniors and pensioners. It is a record that all Canadians can be very proud of. Our government understands that Canada's seniors helped to build this country, to make our country great. That is why we are proud to be putting money directly back into the pockets of our seniors and pensioners, in a number of ways but certainly by lowering taxes.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122743">At the same time, we have strengthened Canada's retirement income system so that it is there to serve the needs of Canadians for today and for tomorrow. The result of our leadership is clear. Canada's retirement income system is acknowledged to be among the world's best by groups such as the OECD in terms of preventing poverty among seniors and ensuring appropriate income in retirement.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122744">Under our low-tax plan, 83% of Canadians are on track for a comfortable retirement, according to McKinsey &amp; Company. What is more, the 2014 Global AgeWatch Index ranked Canada as the fourth-best country in the world in which to grow old.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122745">Let me also remind members that according to the latest Melbourne Mercer Global Pension Index, Canada has the best retirement income system in the G7, one of the leading retirement income systems in the world. Scott Clausen, a member at Mercer, said:</ParaText><ParaText id="4122746"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Canada’s retirement system continues to be one of the strongest retirement systems in the world by providing a combination of universal pensions, income-tested...employer pensions, individual RRSPs and individual TFSAs....</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4122747">Even Canadian editorialists recognize that Canada's retirement income system is strong. Andrew Coyne at the <I>National Post</I> said:</ParaText><ParaText id="4122748"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">By most measures, Canada's retirement income support system is an outstanding success. The poverty rate for Canadian seniors...is among the lowest in the world.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4122749">Our targeted relief effort is building on this success. Under our government, 380,000 low-income seniors have been completely removed from the tax rolls. We also introduced the largest GIS increase in over 25 years, helping more than 680,000 seniors right here across Canada. This GIS increase provided eligible low-income seniors with additional annual benefits of up to $600 for single seniors and $840 for couples.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122750">Another way that we are helping Canadians prepare for retirement is by providing new options, voluntary vehicles to help them save. We developed and implemented the framework for pooled registered pension plans, which will provide a low-cost and large-scale retirement savings option to the roughly 60% of Canadians who do not have a workplace pension plan. Pooled registered pension plans, or PRPPs, are of particular help to employees of small- and medium-sized businesses who until now have not had access to low-cost private pension options. PRPPs help them by establishing large-scale, broad-based voluntary pension arrangements available to employees with or without a participating employer as well as even the self-employed. PRPPs are very advantageous for those people who are self-employed. This innovative new option would place a high emphasis on consent, and be available to the federally regulated private sector and crown corporations.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122751"> It would add to the other options we have created, such as the landmark tax-free savings account. Eleven million Canadians have signed up for the tax-free savings account. They have opened an account. The majority of accounts belong to low- and middle-income earners. Half of the account holders earn under $42,000 a year. The tax-free savings account has been particularly beneficial to seniors as neither income earned in a TFSA nor the withdrawals from a TFSA affect account holders' federal income-tested benefits and credits, such as GIS.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122752">Due to popular demand, we increased the annual tax-free savings account contribution from $5,000 to $5,500, and then to $10,000 in economic action plan 2015. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="15">(2015)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4122753">This is also particularly beneficial to seniors. Some 600,000 seniors aged 65 and over with an income below $60,000 are currently maximizing their tax-free savings account and would benefit from the measure that we have brought forward. This move was praised by CARP, which said:</ParaText><ParaText id="4122754"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">CARP members welcome government action in Budget 2015...to almost double the TFSA from $5,500 to $10,000...</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4122755">Another staple of our low-tax plan is the introduction of pension income splitting for seniors. Pension income splitting is helping over two million seniors and pensioners every year. I hear from them at tax time. I hear from them after they have visited their accountant, and year after year, they thank us for that measure.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122756">We know that both opposition parties are fundamentally opposed to income splitting. Just like they would take away income splitting for nearly two million families, if given the chance, we believe that they would take away pension income splitting for those two million seniors. We will not let that happen.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122757">There are additional ways that the Liberal Party, in particular, would pick the pockets of seniors. As I have said, under our government, 600,000 seniors are currently maximizing their tax-free savings account and would benefit from the increase to the tax-free savings limit. However, again, given the chance, the Liberal leader would shut those accounts down. The Liberals' billion-dollar blunder in the last plan that they put forward was exposed when they had to airbrush their website. Now, they are proposing to fill the holes in their discredited plan by cutting TFSAs and using the revenue.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122758">It is clear that only our government can be trusted to keep taxes low for Canadians and, certainly, for Canadian seniors. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122759">What we will not suggest is raising taxes on workers while claiming that it is for their own good. Under our government, there will be no mandatory job-killing and economy-destablizing pension tax hike for employees or, certainly, for employers. Let me quote Dan Kelly, of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, who cautioned against forcing Canadians and small businesses to pay higher payroll taxes. He said:</ParaText><ParaText id="4122760"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">CFIB’s <I>Forced Savings</I> report shows that increasing Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) benefits would result in higher premiums for businesses and employees, significant job losses and lower wages for Canadians.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122761">What is more, finance department estimates indicate that the NDP would kill thousands of jobs by hiking mandatory CPP contributions.

The Association of Canadian Pension Management offers a concise summary of some of the challenges that we are overcoming. It notes that:</ParaText><ParaText id="4122767"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> Sponsors of DB pension plans are continuing to struggle with the significant funding challenges posed by continuing low interest and annuity rates, complex and increasingly volatile investment markets, chronic solvency funding issues.... </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4122768">Currently, 96% of pension plans across Canada are in defined benefit plans, as compared to 71% in the United Kingdom, 42% in the United States and 15% in Australia, but faced with such recent developments, employers are under increasing pressure to move their employees to defined contribution models, which exposes employees to market volatility and longevity risk. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122769">Our government appreciates that Canadians want a more predictable option and employers want to attract or retain workers with a strong pension plan. That is why we launched extensive consultation on the proposed framework for target benefit plans, or TBPs in April 2014. Our consultation placed a high emphasis on the importance of consent, and proposes to require plan members and retirees to agree to converting existing benefits.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122770">Target benefit plans would offer new, voluntary, sustainable and flexible pension options to the employees of federally regulated corporations. They would not involve changes to federal public sector pension plans that are governed by their own respective legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122771">The proposed target benefit plan framework combines features of both defined benefits and defined contribution plans. Similar to defined benefit plans, TBPs would provide highly predictable income for life for the employee, but as with defined contribution plans, target benefit plans would offer cost certainty for employers. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122772">The plan would also be flexible, allowing for the conversion of both defined benefits and defined contribution plans into target benefit plans. All plan parties would have a say in the decision as to whether or not to adopt the target benefit plan, as well as how the plan would be designed. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122773">Members and retirees would also benefit from the pooling of longevity risk, which is not a feature of defined contribution plans. In short, by providing a better balance of protection and costs, TBPs would offer a sustainable, innovative pension option to help support better retirement savings for Canadian workers.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122774">Having consulted extensively with Canadians, pension experts and industry, our government continues its work in developing a framework for TBPs that meets the needs of all stakeholders.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122775">Although the details of this framework have yet to be finalized, I can assure Canadians what TBPs will not do: TBPs will not take away benefits that retirees already have earned without their consent. We will not bring forward a framework that allows for the conversion of accrued benefits without explicit consent from pension holders. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122776">We are still working toward finalizing an effective and responsive framework for target benefit plans that reflects this commitment. In the meantime, those who are retired or saving for retirement will benefit tremendously from targeted tax relief, new optional savings methods like the tax-free savings account, and the full range of measures that I have outlined here this evening.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Our budget prudently accounts for changes to the global economy, eliminates the deficit, and continues to deliver low taxes, economic growth, and long-term prosperity.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122840">Contrast our low-tax plan with the Liberal one, according to the current Liberal finance critic: </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122841"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> It is unacceptable, frankly, that the [previous Liberal government] balanced the budget on the backs of ordinary Canadians and [refused] to provide any benefits back to the ordinary Canadian taxpayer. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4122842">That is the Liberal plan. In contrast, our government will continue our low-tax plan for jobs, growth, and security, and while balancing the budget as well. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122843"> There is a path to prosperity, and then there is a path to spending hikes, tax hikes, and unaffordable debt. We must choose the right course, the course that will create jobs and growth, not stifle the Canadian economy and hurt families. That is what Canadians expect of their government. Unlike the Liberals, our government does not believe that we can nor should tax our way to prosperity. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122844">Let me remind members that it was the Liberal leader who said “Canadians could be convinced to accept a tax hike if it means a better economic plan”.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122845">This type of ideology of tax and spend is not surprising, given the last time that Canada saw a Trudeau in government. Federal spending tripled, prompted by temporary highs in commodity prices, and this type of reckless spending was not in response to economic crisis. As a result, under Pierre Elliott Trudeau's mandate, Canada experienced some of the worst federal budget deficits in peacetime history. We are still paying for it today. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122846">In common Liberal fashion, Jean Chrétien balanced the budget by hiking taxes, cutting vital programs, and slashing billions in transfer payments. Such actions put Canada's health care and education at risk. Everything we have learned from the post-recession history proves that Liberal policies would be devastating for the economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122847">Unlike the Liberal leader who thinks budgets balance themselves, our government has brought Canada back to balance this year. Canadians understand the importance of living within their means and expect their government to do the same. Balanced budgets keep taxes low and ensure that government services are sustained over the long run. More importantly perhaps, they ensure that future generations like our children and grandchildren are not saddled with huge debts.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122848">However, if given the chance, the opposition would raise taxes and drive Canada into dangerous levels of deficit and debt. The Liberal finance critic said it himself: “Liberals believe Canadians will not be bothered by being taxed more and more..”. Again, that is an example of the Liberal's tax and spend policies.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122849">This is not a formula for success, nor what Canadians need or want. Canadian families sit around their kitchen table to talk about their budgets and how to stretch every dollar. They cannot afford to pay more taxes. Such Liberal schemes will not help them balance their budgets; in fact, it would do the opposite.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122850">Our government is not only setting an example by balancing our budget, but we are helping families balance theirs as well, by giving money directly into the pockets of every hard-working Canadian family. Again, this is in stark contrast to the Liberal leader, who said, “benefiting every single family is not what is fair”. I believe that contrasts with the very definition of fairness. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="45">(2045)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4122851">Our Conservative government believes it is fair to benefit every single Canadian family and provide opportunities for all Canadians. We will make no apologies for helping all Canadian families. We understand that benefiting every single family is indeed our definition of fair.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122852">Given the ongoing uncertain global economic environment, it is not the time for risky plans or reckless spending as proposed by both the Liberal and NDP leaders. Instead, it is crucial for the government to continue to pursue the objectives that have underpinned the economic action plan since its inception in 2009. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122853">That is why we have introduced balanced budget legislation. It will ensure that the hard-won gains achieved by our government will remain in place for future generations. It will also ensure that the only acceptable deficit will be one that responds to a recession or an extraordinary circumstance, such as war or natural disaster. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122854">It is not uncommon for a government to run deficits to respond to a severe downturn in the economy, but deficits outside of a recession or an extraordinary circumstance are unacceptable, and the need to return to balanced budgets is immediate. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122855">To that end, this legislation proposes that should Canada again enter into deficit, the finance minister would be required to testify before the House of Commons committee on finance within 30 days and present a plan, with concrete timelines, to return to balanced budgets. Moreover, should the deficit be due to a recession or other extraordinary circumstance, operating spending would be frozen, as would the salaries of ministers and deputy ministers government-wide, once the recovery begins. If, on the other hand, the deficit is due to mismanagement, operating budgets would be frozen automatically, and the salaries of ministers and deputy ministers alike would be reduced by 5%. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122856">This approach would ensure that any increase in spending to respond to a recession, war, or natural disaster would be temporary, targeted, and timely. By balancing the budget, we are raising Canada's economic potential and creating stable, well-paying jobs. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122857">By staying the course and sticking to our proven economic action plan, Canada remains on track to a better future for all Canadians. That is what Canadians want and deserve. They cannot afford a tax and spend government, something the opposition is much too eager to do. Canadians know that it is our government that will keep taxes low, help foster jobs, and create long-term prosperity so that our children and grandchildren have a bright future.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122858">In closing, I would like to ask a question to the Minister of Finance. I would like to ask him why balanced budgets matter.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="50">(2050)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Oliver" id="8707623"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="204553" Type="4">Hon. Joe Oliver</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4122859">Mr. Chair, I would be pleased to answer the question about why balanced budgets matter.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122860">A balanced budget matters because it allows the government to cut taxes even more for hard-working Canadians, creating jobs, growth, and long-term prosperity. It means less debt for future generations, ensures that taxpayer dollars go toward important social programs like education and health care rather than debt repayment, and it gives the government more flexibility to respond to a crisis like a recession or war or natural disaster. It preserves our triple-A credit rating, the top credit rating that a country can have, allows for international shocks, and it prevents passing on more debt to our children.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122861">What is also important is how the budget is balanced. In our case, it came from strict fiscal discipline. Unlike the Liberals, we will not raise taxes or slash transfers to people, provinces, and territories. Our government has cut taxes every year since taking office. Over 180 tax relief measures have been undertaken since 2006. What is the result? The result is that Canadians now benefit from the lowest overall federal tax burden in more than half a century.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122862">These benefits of balancing the budget are so important that we are proposing a law with pay cuts to ministers and top bureaucrats if the government falls into deficit in normal economic times. We believe that Ottawa is capable of doing what families have to do every day. That means setting priorities and making choices. We will propose that if a government posts a deficit outside of extraordinary circumstances, an automatic operating freeze would go into effect and there would be a cut in salaries for ministers and deputy ministers by 5%. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122863">Our government will balance the budget and continue to ensure that hard-working Canadian families have more money in their pockets when they need it most. Our government has paid down $37 billion in debt since 2006, prior to the great recession that rocked the world economy. That forward thinking helped Canada to achieve the lowest total government net debt to GDP ratio in the G7, and made it affordable to boost growth through federal spending without compromising our top-notch credit rating.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122864">Responsible fiscal management and firm control over direct program spending put Canada on a predictable path back to a balanced budget by 2015, providing consumers and businesses with the confidence to invest and grow the economy. As the <I>The New York Times</I> recently reported, after-tax income for middle-class Canadians, substantially behind in 2000, now appears to be higher than in the United States. In fact, the Canadian middle class is among the richest in the developed world. <I>Bloomberg </I> has ranked Canada as the second-most attractive place in the world to do business. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122865">Our approach is working. Since the depths of the recession, over 1.2 million net new jobs have been created, overwhelmingly full-time, well-paying, and in the private sector.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122866">However, these are tough economic times around the world. It is not time for risky, high-tax, high-spend Liberal initiatives. In a fragile global economy, we must continue taking action to create jobs, growth, and long-term prosperity. Our government plan would do exactly do that by fulfilling our long-standing commitment to balancing the federal budget.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I am here to highlight one of the central initiatives in budget 2015, the important role our government plays in supporting infrastructure in Canada. Canadians rely on public infrastructure on a day-to-day basis. It gets us to work in the morning and home at night. It moves our goods to market, connecting our people and businesses with the world. It connects our families.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122926">Canada's prosperity and quality of life depend on a vast network of public infrastructure, from roads to highways to bridges to transit systems, water and waste water infrastructure, ports, airports, and recreational and cultural facilities. Investments in Canada's public infrastructure create jobs, support trade, and promote productivity and economic growth in communities across Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122927">The Liberals take great pride in their record when they were in government, but the facts tell a different story. The Liberals under Paul Martin ran an ad hoc, unpredictable and insufficient so-called infrastructure program. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122928">In contrast, through our government's long-term commitment to public infrastructure, we have made significant investments in infrastructure across Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122929">Through the $33-billion building Canada plan, our government has helped build over 12,000 provincial, territorial and municipal infrastructure projects from one end of this country to the other, but we did not stop there. We went even further.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122930">Economic action plan 2013 committed $70 billion in public infrastructure over the next decade. This includes the $53-billion new building Canada plan for provincial, territorial and municipal infrastructure. This funding was unprecedented and the largest, longest federal infrastructure plan in Canadian history.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122931">To build on this record, our government also doubled the gas tax fund to help municipalities address their infrastructure priorities. To top that off, we even made the fund permanent. I know the Liberals do not like to hear that, so let me repeat it. We took a temporary program, passed legislation, over their objections, and made it permanent. Last year we announced it would grow at 2% per year, to be applied in $100-million increments. This means local municipalities will get an additional $1.8 billion in funding over the next decade for their roads, sewers, bridges and other like projects.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122932">In York Centre, the riding which I am so privileged to represent, many of the roads, like Wilson Avenue and Finch Avenue have been recently newly paved. Sewers were upgraded on Antibes Drive, just to name a few.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122933">Our government did not stop there. We also added an additional 11 eligible categories, including disaster mitigation, recreation, tourism and culture. As a result, communities have more choice for projects that can be supported by the federal gas tax fund.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122934">Our government listens to local mayors. This fund, which has already done so much for municipalities, will continue to support infrastructure priorities for many years to come.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122935">Another major component of our plan, the new building Canada fund, totals $14 billion over 10 years. Under the new building Canada fund, each province and territory has been allocated a base amount. Funding under this component is available, not just for provincial, but municipal governments as well. Of course, our government also understands the importance of smaller communities and their needs and priorities. That is why we are guaranteeing that $1 billion will be reserved for communities with populations under 100,000 across the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122936">Taken together, investments in infrastructure will keep Canada moving full speed into the future. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122937">We all know that traffic congestion is getting worse in our large cities. Our government understands every minute spent in a car is one less minute spent with our families. It means higher costs for businesses and less livable cities. Building on our government's investment in public transit to date, economic action plan 2015 introduced a new and innovative fund to promote public transit infrastructure investment that is affordable for taxpayers and efficient for commuters.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122938">The public transit fund is a permanent fund that provides up to $1 billion per year for major public transit projects. This is the first time ever a federal government has provided directly for public transit. This is just another way our Conservative government is building on the longest and largest public transit program record in Canadian history.</ParaText>

This new public transit fund will complement our government's existing infrastructure support by providing significant long-term support for public transit projects that help all Canadians. That is what Canadians expect from our government, and we are delivering.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122949">Through the new building Canada plan, our government is providing stable, predictable funding over the next decade for public infrastructure across Canada. While we have a public transit fund in place, our existing federal infrastructure will continue to support thousands of ongoing or new infrastructure projects across Canada in 2015 alone.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122950">While the Liberal Party plan is to raise taxes and recklessly increase spending, our Conservative government is committed to investing in public infrastructure to reduce commuting times for families, enhance our economic productivity, and encourage job creation and economic growth across Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122951">I now have a question for the <Affiliation DbId="204553" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122952">What is the government doing to support infrastructure in Canada?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

He has provided dedicated and effective service to his constituents.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122954">Since 2006, our Conservative government has made unprecedented investments in infrastructure across Canada. Under the Paul Martin Liberals' so-called infrastructure program, funding was unpredictable and insufficient. Unlike the Liberals, our government listens to concerns of mayors, premiers and regional chairs. That is why we have made historic investments in infrastructure. </ParaText><ParaText id="4122955">Through the $33-billion building Canadian plan, our government has helped to build over 12,000 provincial, territorial and municipal infrastructure projects from coast to coast to coast.

The new building Canada fund is open for business. The fund will help to build stronger communities and support local economies across Canada.</ParaText>

The 150th anniversary of Confederation is a time to celebrate the places across this great country that unite and connect us, such as the parks, the trails and the cultural and community centres. The infrastructure program will help preserve and improve these treasured cultural and community locations, allowing Canadians and their families to enjoy moments of sport, recreation, leisure and contemplation for years to come.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122958">I should also mention the gas tax fund, which is federal money that helps municipalities with their infrastructure priorities. It was originally a temporary program, but when we saw how important it was to Canadian cities and towns, we took action. We made it permanent. We doubled it. It grows annually now, representing an additional $1.8 billion in funding over the next decade. The gas tax fund comprises the largest portion of the new building Canada plan and it is providing $2 billion to support local infrastructure projects this fiscal year.</ParaText><ParaText id="4122959">Building on these investments, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> announced an additional $5.8-billion investment to build new infrastructure across the country. This funding would support the modernization and repair of important infrastructure assets to create jobs in communities across Canada and to contribute to Canada's long-term economic prosperity.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4122960">Our government is following through on our commitment to build infrastructure that is unprecedented in Canadian history, and our success speaks for itself. We are investing in public infrastructure. We are investing in transit.

They account for 99% of all businesses in Canada and employ half the working men and women in the Canadian private sector.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123025"> Our government believes that owners of small businesses should spend their time growing their business and creating jobs, not choking on high taxes and wallowing in red tape.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123026"> Today I want to give members a quick snapshot of why it is only our government that can be trusted to keep taxes low for all Canadians. </ParaText><ParaText id="4123027">We have cut taxes significantly for small businesses and their owners. We cut the small business tax rate to 11% as of 2008, and by the way, as soon as we pass economic action plan 2015, we will be reducing it to 9%. We increased the amount of annual income eligible for this lower rate from $300,000 to $400,000 in 2007 and to $500,000 in 2009. We cut the general corporate income tax rate to 15% in 2012 from 22.12%. All of these benefits help successful small businesses when their income exceeds $500,000. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4123028">We increased the lifetime capital gains exemption on qualified small business shares to $750,000 from $500,000 in 2007. The government further increased this exemption to $800,000 in 2014 and indexed the limit to inflation, bringing it to $813,600 for 2015. The exemption is estimated to be delivering over $1 billion of tax relief annually to small business owners and owners of farms and fishing businesses. By the way, they are creating jobs with those savings.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123029">We also reduced small business EI premiums by introducing the small business job credit. This credit is expected to save small businesses more than $550 million over 2015 and 2016. These measures will benefit hard-working small business owners all across the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123030">Unlike the opposition, our government believes that the best way to create jobs is to lower taxes for job creators. That is exactly what we are doing.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123031">Economic action plan 2015 cuts taxes even further for small businesses. To encourage small business growth, economic action plan 2015 proposes to reduce the small business tax rate to 9% by 2019. This would be the largest cut in the tax rate for small businesses in more than 25 years. It is estimated that the cut to 9% for small businesses would reduce taxes for small businesses and their owners by $2.7 billion over 2015 to 2019. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4123032">For example, a small business with a taxable income of half a million dollars would pay 46% less tax in 2019 compared to when we came into office in 2006. This means that their annual tax reduction can be reinvested in the business to fuel its growth and create jobs for even more Canadians. By the way, we have already created 1.2 million net new jobs since the depths of the recession, and that is only the beginning.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123033">Alongside lower taxes, businesses also need access to capital. They have to have capital if they expect to develop. That is why our government is introducing changes to the Canada small business financing program. This program facilitates the extension of loans by private sector financial institutions to small businesses for the acquisition of real property and equipment and for leasehold improvements.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="45">(2145)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4123034">The program helps new businesses get started, helps established firms to make improvements and expand, and improves access to loans that would not otherwise be available to small businesses. That stimulates economic growth. That creates jobs for Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123035">Since 2006, when our government took office, this program has provided over 50,000 loans to small businesses, with loans totalling approximately $1 billion per year. </ParaText><ParaText id="4123036">Economic action plan 2015 proposes to amend the Canada Small Business Financing Act to make two changes: first, it will increase the maximum loan amount for real property from $500,000 to $1 million; second, it will raise the small business eligibility criterion from firms with gross annual revenues of $5 million or less to firms with gross annual revenues of $10 million and under.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123037">In addition to reducing taxes and improving access to capital, action is also being taken to reduce the amount of red tape that is hindering the growth and success of small businesses across the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123038">Any entrepreneur will say that running a small business means long hours and selfless sacrifice. Our government believes that entrepreneurs' time is best served growing their businesses, rather than being bogged down in red tape and having to pay exorbitant taxes. That is why cutting red tape is an absolute priority for us. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4123039">Since its implementation in 2012, the red tape reduction action plan has proved to be a very successful control on the growth of red tape, while maintaining high standards for safety and protection.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123040">The one-for-one rule and other reforms have brought a new level of discipline on how the government regulates businesses. The one-for-one rule requires that when a new regulation is added, one must be removed. This measure alone has saved businesses an estimated $22 million last year alone, along with 290,000 fewer hours dealing with red tape.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123041">Economic action plan 2015 will build on these successes to reduce the tax compliance burden faced by our businesses. That includes a new quarterly remitter category for the smallest new employers, which will reduce the frequency of remittance payments by two-thirds. Beginning in 2016, new employers will be eligible to make quarterly rather than monthly payments to the CRA if their monthly withholdings are less than $1,000 and they have maintained a perfect compliance record.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123042">That is valuable time employers can reclaim and reinvest in both their operations and their families. Going forward, our government remains committed to continuing to provide tax relief to all Canadians, including small business owners and families.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4123043">Speaking of small business owners and their families, I think one of the most important pieces in our economic action plan 2015 is the introduction of an increase to the tax-free savings account. This is being lauded by not only business people, who recognize that this is a pool of capital that will be created for use and investment, but also by our children, who are perhaps saving for their first home purchase. It is being lauded by our seniors, our parents, who are putting a little bit by because they do not want to be terrorized by the fact that they are living longer. They want to be able to have savings for their wonderful long lives.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123044">It is very important that we recognize that the tax-free savings account is helping all Canadians. As the minister said earlier, 60% of people who hold a tax-free savings account earn less than $60,000, and half of tax-free savings accounts are held by people who earn less than $42,000. That is a program that is helping the middle class.</ParaText>

This includes fulfilling our commitment to cut the GST twice.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123048">It is good for the overall economy.

They do not understand that keeping taxes low for all Canadians will ensure our long-term prosperity.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123050">Beyond tax relief, our government also understands that Canadians expect high-quality health care services and education. That is why our government has balanced the budget while increasing transfers to the provinces for health care and social services by record amounts. In fact, major transfers to provinces and territories, including the Canada health transfer and the Canada social transfer, will amount to almost $68 billion in 2015-16, an all-time high.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4123051">Economic action plan 2015 builds on the government's record of support for Canadian families by continuing to help them save. Through our new family tax measures, every single family with children under the age of 18 in Canada will be better off.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123052">We will introduce tax relief for seniors and persons with disabilities to make their homes more accessible, as well as measures to help students pay for their education.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123053">Since 2006, the government has introduced measures to make life more affordable for families. We have reduced the lowest personal income tax rate and increased the basic personal amount. We have cut the GST from 7% to 5%. We have introduced pension income splitting. We have established tax credits to support low-income workers, public transit users, first-time homebuyers, and families caring for disabled relatives.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123054">We have provided additional support for families with children through the children's arts and fitness tax credits, an enhancement to registered education savings plans, and adoption expense tax credits. Most recently, our government has introduced a new family tax cut, enhancements to the universal child care benefit, and an increase in the maximum dollar limits of a child care expense deduction.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123055">Canadians of all income levels have benefited from the income tax relief introduced by our government, with low- and middle-income Canadians receiving proportionately greater relief.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4123056">This year Canadian families and individuals will receive $37 billion in tax relief and increased benefits as a result of actions taken since 2006. For example, a typical two-earner family of four will receive tax relief and increased benefits of up to $6,600 in 2015, thanks to measures such as the family tax cut, the universal child care benefit, the goods and services tax rate reduction, the children's fitness tax credit, and other measures.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123057">By reducing taxes year after year and enhancing benefits to Canadians, the government has given families and individuals greater flexibility to make the choices that are right for them.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Ron Cannan (Kelowna—Lake Country, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4123107">Mr. Chair, it is a pleasure to rise this evening to participate in this important meeting of committee of the whole to discuss Canada's prudent economic policies. I would like to focus my comments this evening on our government's steadfast support for Canada's seniors, folks who have helped build a country that is strong, prosperous and secure.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123108">Our government respects Canada's seniors for their efforts, but more than respecting them, we are empowering them to become stronger, more prosperous and more secure, just as they did for Canada. We have a well-established record of achievement in this regard. Among the foremost of our achievements is ensuring that more seniors are not burdened with paying taxes after having already given so much to their country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4123109">As a result of our low-tax plan, about 400,000 seniors have been removed from the tax rolls. Since 2006, our government has increased the age credit amount by $2,000, $1,000 in 2006 and another $1,000 in 2009. We have doubled the maximum amount of income eligible for the pension income credit to $2,000. We have introduced pension income splitting, which is benefiting over two million Canadians every year.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123110"> However, sadly to say, the Liberals have stated that they would take away income splitting for nearly two million families. Just like they would take away this tax saving from families, I have heard they would also take this income-splitting plan away from seniors. We regret that both opposition parties plan to raise taxes on middle-class seniors.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123111">By contrast, as a result of actions taken by the government to date, seniors and pensioners are receiving about $3 billion in additional annual targeted tax relief. In 2015, a single senior could earn at least $20,000 and a senior couple at least $40,000 before paying federal income tax. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4123112">Not only are we leaving seniors with more money in their pockets, but we are empowering them to make the most of their savings. In the fall of 2014, we partnered with the <Affiliation DbId="204553" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="194599" Type="4">Minister of State for Finance </Affiliation> and as well the hard-working <Affiliation DbId="170708" Type="4">Minister of State for Seniors</Affiliation>. Under the guidance of the new Financial Literacy Leader, our government released a strategy to enhance the financial literacy of seniors. Its aim is to help seniors and near-seniors plan for and manage their finances during their later years and ensures they get the fair treatment they deserve. This is a request that I have heard from my constituents. We responded, and we required enhanced disclosure by banks and the costs and benefits of using powers of attorney for joint accounts and more robust bank processes and staff training.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123113"> By building on this record of support for seniors, economic action plan 2015 takes us a step further in helping seniors to effectively manage their finances.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123114">As the member of Parliament for Kelowna—Lake Country, I am very proud to represent a high proportion of seniors, including folks like Mr. and Mrs Sawatzky who were on Parliament Hill today and many other of my seniors, who maybe watching the other channel as the Rockets are just a few wins away from winning the Memorial Cup, we hope. Go Rockets, go.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4123115">However, what I heard, loud and clear, and have communicated to the finance minister, was a need to relax the rules surrounding registered retirement income funds, known as RRIFs, as seniors are living longer and with healthier lifestyles. We listened and acted. The budget would do exactly this. It would strengthen seniors' retirement options. By permitting more capital preservation, the new factors would help reduce the risk of out-living one's savings, while ensuring that the tax deferral provided on registered retirement savings plans, or RRSPs, and the RRIF savings accounts continue to serve a retirement income purpose.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123116">At the same time, economic action plan 2015 would increase the tax-free savings accounts, otherwise known as TFSAs. The annual contribution limit would go from $5,500 to $10,000. This gives Canadians, including seniors, more room to save money tax free. At the end of 2013, about 46% of individuals who contributed the maximum amount to their tax-free savings account were seniors.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123117"> Taken together, these new measures will support the retirement income needs of seniors, providing them with increased flexibility to manage their savings in a tax-efficient manner.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123118">However, that is not all. Economic action plan 2015 also proposes a new home accessibility tax credit for seniors and persons with disabilities. This permanent, non-refundable credit will help with the cost of renovations to allow seniors and persons with disabilities to live independently and safely in their homes.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="15">(2215)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4123119">At the same time, economic action plan will extend compassionate care benefits from the current six weeks to six months to ensure employment insurance benefits are available when Canadians need them most, something on which all of us in the House have heard from our constituents. It is a very welcome addition to budget 2015. Also, it will provide up to $42 million over five years, starting in 2015-16, to help improve seniors' health through innovation by establishing the Canadian centre for aging and brain health innovation, which is another important area of research.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123120">These are all important advancements we are making for the benefit of seniors, and they are building on a solid foundation of support that we continue to strengthen. </ParaText><ParaText id="4123121">I will quickly touch on how we have acted to strengthen Canada's retirement income system to serve the needs of today's and future retirees. </ParaText><ParaText id="4123122">We increased benefits for the guaranteed income supplement, GIS, for Canada's most vulnerable seniors. This investment of roughly $300 million each year improves the well-being of approximately 680,000 seniors across Canada and represents the largest GIS increase for the lowest-income seniors in a quarter century, a caring and compassionate measure I might add. We have also improved the regulations supporting private retirement savings and expanded opportunities through new private savings vehicles, like the pooled registered pension plans. Taken together, these initiatives provide a strong foundation upon which Canadians can achieve their retirement goals with confidence. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4123123">The effectiveness of our government's achievements is underscored by expert third-party analysis. Canada's retirement income system is acknowledged to be among the world's best by groups like the OECD in terms of preventing poverty among seniors and ensuring appropriate income retirement. </ParaText><ParaText id="4123124">With all the actions I have outlined today, we are making Canada's seniors stronger, more prosperous and more secure. By doing so, we are giving back to them what they have given to us.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123125">My question for the hon. <Affiliation DbId="194599" Type="4">Minister of State for Finance</Affiliation> is this.

Many senior Canadians are now making this choice in order to stay connected with our social network or to add to their financial resources. These employment opportunities not only help these individuals in meeting their personal goals, but they also provide access to experienced talent that is often sought by other employers.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123129">To support labour force participation by seniors, our government renewed the targeted initiative for older worker program in 2014. It was renewed for a three-year period, which helps the unemployed workers aged 55 to 64 living in small economically-vulnerable communities to improve their employability and reintegrate into the labour market.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123130">Since its launch in 2007, our total investment in this initiative will be an estimated $345 million by March 31, 2017. To date, more than 35,000 unemployed older workers have been targeted to participate in the initiative. </ParaText>

It helps them find a job that matches their skill set.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123132">In addition to working, a large number of seniors also want to give back to their communities through volunteerism. The new horizon for seniors program helps seniors both benefit and contribute to the quality of life in their community through social participation and active living. </ParaText><ParaText id="4123133">Since 2006, new horizons has funded over 13,000 projects, including those helping seniors and community members, to recognize elder abuse in all its forms and to improve the quality of life, safety and security of seniors.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123134">I am proud to say that even in my riding of Crowfoot, I have had the opportunity to meet with senior organizations that have applied for and received funding through this new horizon program. I am also pleased that, through economic action plan 2014, we invested an additional $5 million per year for new horizons to support projects that have enabled seniors to share their knowledge, skills and experiences with others, bringing total funding for the program to $50 million annually.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123135">New horizons is yet another example of how we are making Canada's seniors stronger, more prosperous and more secure.

Our government has consistently recognized that our country can only be as strong as its middle class. Fortunately, Canada's middle class has been steadfast in an uncertain world. They have seen increases of about 30% in their take-home incomes since 1976. The share of Canadians living in low-income families is now at its lowest level over the past three decades.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123198">A recent Statistics Canada study has revealed that since our government has taken office, the middle class has flourished significantly:</ParaText><ParaText id="4123199"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The median net worth of Canadian family units was $243,800 in 2012, up 44.5% from 2005 and almost 80% more than the 1999 median of $137,000, adjusted for inflation.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4123200">Another study, this one from the <I>New York Times</I>, has indicated that Canada's middle class is better off financially than that of the <?bk?>U.S.:<?ek?></ParaText><ParaText id="4123201"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">After-tax middle-class incomes in Canada—substantially behind in 2000—now appear to be higher than in the United States.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4123202">Furthermore, since 2006, Canadian families in all major income groups have seen increases of about 10% or more in their take-home incomes. However, in an economic context, as well, Canada is doing well and continues to improve, which sets a positive environment for the middle class.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4123203">Our country continues to move forward in the face of a fragile external environment and profound global economic uncertainty. In fact, Canada has achieved one of the best economic performances among G7 countries after the recovery. Real gross domestic product has increased more in Canada than in any other G7 country since the end of the recession. It goes to show that Canada's economic action plan is working.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123204"> At a time when other countries' financial systems were brought to the brink of bankruptcy, Canada's banks remained the soundest in the world. When other countries increased taxes, Canada kept its taxes low. In fact, the overall federal tax burden is the lowest it has been in over 50 years.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123205">One of the easiest and best ways to help the middle class is to let them keep more of their money not in government coffers, not in wasteful bureaucratic programs, but directly with them in their own pockets. It is why our government has been so committed to cutting taxes for all Canadians, but especially for the middle class.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123206">Indeed, since 2006, Canadians have benefited from significant, broad-based tax cuts introduced by our Conservative government. These tax reductions have given individuals and families the flexibility to make choices that are right for them and have helped build a solid foundation for future economic growth, more jobs, and higher living standards for Canadians.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4123207">In total, our government has introduced over 180 tax relief measures since 2006, reducing taxes in every way the Government of Canada collects them. Canadians of all income levels are benefiting from tax relief, with low- and middle-income Canadians receiving proportionately greater relief.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123208">Some of the key actions we have taken to reduce taxes for all Canadians include the following: reducing the lowest personal income tax rate and increasing the basic personal amount; cutting the GST from 7% to 5%; introducing pension income-splitting; establishing tax credits to support low-income workers, public transit users, first-time homebuyers, and families caring for disabled relatives; and providing additional support for families with children through the children's arts and fitness tax credit and enhancements to the registered education savings plan and the adoption expense tax credit.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123209">Our government has introduced even more measures to go even further to help families make ends meet.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="45">(2245)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4123210">For example, we are implementing the family tax cut, which would allow a higher-income spouse to effectively transfer up to $50,000 of taxable income to a spouse in a lower tax bracket. We are increasing the universal child care benefit for children under six and are expanding it to children aged six through 17; as of January 1, 2015, parents are eligible for a benefit of $160 per month for each child under the age of six and for $60 per month for children aged six through 17. We are also introducing the child care expense deduction dollar limits by $1,000, and for those parents who put their children into sports, we have doubled the children's fitness tax credit to $1,000 and made it refundable.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123211">Our government has also established the tax-free savings account, which is the most significant advance in the tax treatment of personal savings since the RRSP. This year, in order to help Canadians save even more of their hard-earned money, economic action plan 2015 proposes to increase the TFSA annual contribution limit to $10,000.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123212">As a result of our government's actions, a typical two-earner family of four would receive tax relief and increased benefits of up to $6,600 in 2015. This represents real, concrete savings for the middle class.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4123213">These important measures are just a handful of examples illustrating how our government has responded to the needs of Canadian families and helped Canadians keep more of their hard-earned money. </ParaText><ParaText id="4123214">However, the opposition members think very differently. They believe that taxing Canadians more will in fact bring long-term prosperity. We will not raise taxes on Canadians. They believe that it is not fair when our actions benefit every single Canadian family. We believe that is completely counterintuitive. When we are benefiting every Canadian family, that is the exact definition of fairness. </ParaText><ParaText id="4123215">The opposition members believe that plans of high debt and high deficits have no bearing on the everyday Canadian. We reject this idea, which would raise the cost of living in Canada, saddle families with higher taxes, and burden future generations with these reckless schemes. There is a clear divide between our Conservative government and the opposition, which does not seem to understand just how devastating tax hikes and reckless spending would be, not only to the Canadian economy but more so to the middle class.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4123216"> Perhaps one of the most significant ways to ensure the prosperity of Canadians is to keep Canada's books in order and bring the budget to balance, as I mentioned. When the great recession hit us, we responded quickly and effectively with a historic stimulus program, and we emerged from the recession faster and stronger than virtually any other major advanced economy. When the crisis passed, we promised Canadians that we would balance the budget. We delivered on that promise, but we did not do it by raising taxes or cutting transfers for education and health care. We focused on controlling operating expenses for federal departments, identifying efficiencies to make government operations leaner.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123217"> A balanced budget will preserve Canada's low-tax plan and allow for further tax reductions, fostering growth and the creation of jobs for the benefit of all Canadians. </ParaText><ParaText id="4123218">Balanced budgets play a significant role in helping the middle class. By taking the time to make smart fiscal and economic decisions under the leadership of our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, we are ensuring that the choices we make today will not hurt the futures of our children and grandchildren. I know that is what many Canadian families are concerned about, and let us make no mistake: high debt and high deficits now will saddle future generations with an even greater burden.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4123219">This government understands the importance of middle-class Canadians and their future, and as our actions have shown, we listened and worked diligently to ensure that Canada's middle class is among the richest in the developed world. Needless to say, we will continue this trend and look for more ways to help the middle class thrive and contribute to the Canadian economy. </ParaText><ParaText id="4123220">I have a question for the finance minister.

As a result of our actions, over 1.2 million more Canadians are working now than at the end of the recession in June 2009. This represents one of the strongest job creation records in the G7 over this period. The majority of these net new jobs have been full-time positions in high wage, private sector industries.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123223">When it comes to jobs, our government understands that small businesses are the lifeblood of the economy. They account for 99% of all businesses in Canada and employ half of the working men and women in the Canadian private sector. </ParaText><ParaText id="4123224">Our government believes that small businesses should spend their time growing their businesses, creating jobs and hiring Canadians, not choking on high taxes and red tape. That is why we have repeatedly cut taxes significantly for small businesses and their owners. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4123225">Building on our record, budget 2015 proposes to reduce the small business tax rate to 9% by 2019, the largest tax rate cut for small businesses in more than 25 years. When the proposed reduction in the small business tax rate takes effect in 2019, combined with previous actions taken by our government, the amount of federal corporate income tax paid by a small business with $500,000 of taxable income would be 46% lower than in 2006. This means an annual tax reduction of up to $38,600. That money could be reinvested in the business to create new jobs for Canadians. These changes, among others, would help enhance the ability of small businesses across Canada to retain their earnings, to grow their businesses and create jobs. </ParaText><ParaText id="4123226">However, we are also building on our efforts to connect Canadians with the areas that need help. Increasingly, a number of jobs are going unfilled due to a lack of people with the matching skills. That is why we have enhanced labour market information for Canadians, which would efficiently help match Canadian workers with available jobs, reforming the skills training program and encouraging journey persons to start or expand their own business.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123227">These are but a few of the ways we are creating new jobs and filling demands that the private sector is yearning for.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4123228">Furthermore, economic action plan 2015 would bring tax relief to manufacturers. We believe that manufacturing will continue to play a major role in Canada's economic success. For our government, the words “made in Canada” continue to fuel pride, not to mention jobs. </ParaText><ParaText id="4123229">That said, we must give manufacturers the tools they need to create the products and the jobs of the future. That is why we are announcing a 10-year tax incentive to encourage investment in machinery and equipment used in manufacturing and processing. When Canadian companies invest in state-of-the-art equipment and structures, they increase their productivity and competitiveness. </ParaText><ParaText id="4123230">I see that my time is nearly up. I could continue for hours on why job creation is our government's main focus. However, as long as there are middle-class Canadians looking for work, our job is not yet done.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123231">Economic action plan 2015 is the next part of our long-term plan to ensure we get Canadians back to work and continue Canada's economic growth and prosperity.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

By reducing taxes year after year and enhancing direct benefits to Canadians, the government has given families and individuals greater flexibility to make the choices that are right for them. </ParaText><ParaText id="4123276">Canadian families and individuals will receive $37 billion in tax relief and increased benefits in 2015-16 as a result of actions taken by our government since 2006, including measures announced by the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> on October 30, 2014. These new measures will provide more than $4.6 billion in annual tax relief and increased benefits to all families with children under age 18. </ParaText><ParaText id="4123277">These measures include an enhanced universal child care benefit that will provide $160 per month for children under the age of 6 and a new benefit of $60 per month for children aged 6 through 17, and that is effective January 1, 2015; a $1,000 increase in each of the maximum dollar amounts that can be claimed under the child care expense deduction, effective for the 2015 taxation year; and the family tax cut, a federal non-refundable tax credit of up to $2,000 for couples with children under the age of 18, effective for the 2014 taxation year. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4123278">Among the multitude of tax relief measures this government has introduced, perhaps the most popular is the tax-free savings account, or TFSA. The TFSA is the most important new savings vehicle introduced in Canada since the RRSP was introduced over 50 years ago. As a matter of fact, as of the end of 2013, nearly 11 million individuals had opened a TFSA and the total value of assets held in TFSAs was nearly $120 billion. The TFSA gives Canadians the flexibility to save for their priorities. Whether they want to purchase a new home or car, start a new business or save for retirement, Canadians have many reasons to save at every stage of their lives. That is why the government introduced the TFSA in the first place. </ParaText><ParaText id="4123279">Available since 2009, the TFSA is a flexible, registered, general purpose savings vehicle that allows Canadians aged 18 or older to earn tax-free investment income. I should point out that it is a voluntary program. The contributions are not tax deductible, but investment income earned in a TFSA and withdrawals from it are tax free. Unused TFSA contribution room can be carried forward, and the amount of withdrawals from a TFSA can be re-contributed in future years.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4123280">The TFSA provides greater savings incentives for low- and modest-income individuals because, in addition to the tax savings, neither the income earned in a TFSA nor withdrawals from it affect a person's important benefits and credits. Like the Canada child tax benefit, or old age security and guaranteed income supplements that supplement benefits, it is no wonder that Canadians have embraced the TFSA for their savings needs. Best of all, Canadians of all income levels can benefit from TFSAs. </ParaText><ParaText id="4123281">The opposition claims that TFSAs benefit only the rich. This is categorically false. In fact, at the end of 2013, individuals with annual incomes of less than $80,000 accounted for more than 80% of all TFSA holders, and about half of TFSA holders had annual incomes of less than $42,000. About 1.9 million individuals have contributed the maximum amount to their TFSAs. About 46% of these individuals were seniors and over 70% were aged 55 and older. About 60% of the individuals contributing the maximum amount to their TFSAs had incomes of less than $60,000.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4123282">In order to provide Canadians with greater opportunity to save on a tax-free basis, this budget proposes to increase the TFSA annual contribution limit to $10,000, effective for 2015 and subsequent years. This new measure will help Canadians save from coast to coast to coast. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="15">(2315)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4123283">Take, for example, Giselle , a small business owner who saves in her TFSA. She now has the flexibility to contribute $10,000 per year to her TFSA. By earning tax-free investment income on $10,000 of annual savings for 10 years, Giselle can accumulate about $3,700 more dollars in after-tax savings than if she had saved the same amount for 10 years under the existing TFSA annual contribution limit with the remainder in a taxable savings vehicle. Giselle will be able to better save for future priorities, which will be good for her, good for her business, and good for the Canadian economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123284">The TFSA is also a great savings tool for seniors. The fact is that Canadians are living longer than ever, which is great news. Since 2006, seniors have been benefiting from important money-saving measures such as pension income splitting, and taking advantage of their tax-free savings accounts. In fact, as of the end of 2013, close to 2.7 million Canadian seniors had TFSAs. In a low-interest rate environment, the TFSA can help to boost after-tax returns, as these returns are not subject to taxation. The TFSA provides seniors with a savings vehicle to meet their ongoing savings needs, something to which they previously only had limited access to once they were over the age of 71.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4123285">Here is another example. Barry is a retired 72-year-old who does part-time consulting work, and is required to withdraw a minimum amount of $18,000 from his registered retirement income fund, or RRIF. Taking into account his other pension income, his income from part-time consulting work, and his income taxes, Barry's RRIF withdrawal exceeds his current needs by $7,000. With a $10,000 TFSA annual contribution limit, Barry can now save the entire $7,000 remaining from his RRIF withdrawal in his TFSA. </ParaText><ParaText id="4123286">This government understands that Canadian society thrives in a low-tax environment. It is why we introduced the tax-free savings account. It is why we have cut taxes over and over again, in fact over 180 times since we became government in 2006. It is a shame that opposition members have opposed our changes to the tax-free savings account. They do not realize the benefits that it would bring to Canadians across the country. Unlike our Conservative government, the opposition believes in a high-tax, high-spend agenda.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4123287">Our government has lowered taxes every year since coming into office and, as I mentioned, we have introduced over 180 tax-relief measures. This equates to over $37 billion in savings for all Canadians, and $6,600 in average savings per year for the average Canadian family. As a result, the overall federal tax burden is now at its lowest level in over 50 years. In fact, John George Diefenbaker was the prime minister the last time that taxes were this low. Going forward, we will remain committed to keeping taxes low and allowing Canadians to save more of their hard-earned money.</ParaText><ParaText id="4123288"> I would like to ask the <Affiliation DbId="204553" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> a question.

In fact, the Liberal leader's plan simply does not add up. He already admits to a $2 billion shortage. We have discovered an additional $1 billion in his rudimentary miscalculation of the cancellation of the UCC benefit, and of course he has wildly overestimated the amount of tax he would collect through his tax hike. In addition to that, there are more high-cost spending programs to come. The question is, where will he get the money? Will it come from piling on more debt? Will it come from increasing taxes? Will it come from cancelling important programs, such as income splitting for seniors or increased funding to the brave men and women in uniform?
