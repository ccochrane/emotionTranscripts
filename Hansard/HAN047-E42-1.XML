Initial review indicates that, to a large extent, the recommendations reflect many of DFO’s current activities in support of salmon conservation.

Some notable highlights include the following: (a) review of the wild Atlantic salmon conservation policy in partnership with members of the Atlantic Salmon Advisory Committee. This review will address a number of key recommendations made within the report; (b) 
continuation of departmental efforts to press for reduced international harvesting through fora such as the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization, NASCO, particularly for harvests off western Greenland;
(c) continue to engage with France, St- Pierre-et-Miquelon, to reduce its catch and indicate Canada’s desire to see it accede to NASCO; (d) creation of collaborative venues to coordinate and work collaboratively with university researchers, non-governmental organizations, private researchers, in an effort to identify, prioritize and promote collaboration and information sharing on wild Atlantic salmon research; (e) engagement with provinces and first nations on recommendations related to their interests or jurisdictions; (f)  explore the use of innovations in technologies and intelligence to improve and strengthen enforcement efforts; (g) use the precautionary approach framework and its various elements to determine harvest levels; (h) work with groups like the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, on scientific research on the composition of mixed stock fisheries and genetic estimates; and (i) continue to evaluate the annual and multi-year approaches to the management of stocks on a case-by-case and province-by-province basis through annual workshops and consultation processes.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318402">In response to (c), the report of the Ministerial Advisory Committee on Atlantic Salmon and its recommendations generally align with Fisheries and Oceans Canada’s current program of work for wild Atlantic salmon conservation.

In some cases, the department will develop and review options to determine the best path forward to implementing the recommendation. It is recognized that, in some cases, other departments, jurisdictions, and partners may have lead or supporting roles in implementations. For recommendations, such as those focusing on the food, social and ceremonial fishery, FSC, DFO will continue to work with aboriginal partners and indigenous groups, while ensuring that FSC access is not unduly compromised.

Second reading</ProceduralText><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Rudd" id="8888132"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="214681" Type="18">Ms. Kim Rudd (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4318430">Mr. Speaker, I am here today to talk about an issue that touches the lives of every Canadian—how we die. It is not an issue we usually like to discuss, but with the Supreme Court's decision in the Carter case, it is now at the forefront of our government's political and health agenda. On February 6, 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada unanimously declared that the criminal court prohibitions on physician-assisted dying were constitutionally invalid. Changes will come into effect on June 6 of this year. All governments are preparing to respond.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318431">Consultations with the public have made it clear that there is extensive support for the provision of medical assistance in dying. An Angus Reid research poll that was published earlier this month found that 90% of Canadians surveyed think that some form of assisted dying should be allowed. The government takes the Supreme Court of Canada decision seriously.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318432">It is a deeply felt and sensitive issue for all Canadians, and we understand it is essential that implementation of this new legislation be undertaken with careful consideration. That is why the government has developed a framework based on empathy, appropriate protections for vulnerable Canadians, and the need for choice. Careful consideration has been given to the eligibility criteria, substantive and procedural safeguards, and recommendations for monitoring and reporting.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318433"> I also want to make it clear, however, that medical assistance in dying is not to be the only choice for a peaceful, dignified death. No matter where people stand on the issues surrounding medical assistance in dying, they all agree that we must improve palliative care. Palliative care is a multidisciplinary approach to health care for individuals and families who are living with a life-threatening disease as well as other conditions. It focuses on improving quality of life through the prevention and relief of physical and psychological suffering, with treatment plans tailored to the needs of the patient and the family.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318434">Reports about the status of palliative care in Canada suggest that the delivery of and access to palliative care and hospice care varies greatly across Canada. This is due to differences in regional demographics, societal needs, organization of health care services, and levels of funding.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318435">When asked, most Canadians indicate that they would prefer to die at home in the presence of loved ones. There is clearly a need to bridge this disconnect and for all levels of government to support the needs and desires of Canadians at the end of their lives to receive the most appropriate, timely, and compassionate care. The gaps in palliative care have been raised repeatedly over the years by a number of organizations. It is very clear that Canadians are looking to their governments for leadership to close these gaps. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318436">In the past, palliative care in Canada has been delivered primarily in hospitals by specialists, and largely to cancer patients in the last stages of their illness. While many people still associate palliative care with hospitals and cancer patients exclusively, it can be delivered to a variety of patients and in different settings, including long-term care facilities or even one's own home.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318437"> It is estimated that the health system is currently unable to provide palliative care to 70% of those who could benefit from it. This is why our government is taking immediate steps to address this gap and work with the provinces and territories so that more Canadians have access to the care options that are right for them when they need them. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318438">The government is currently funding the Pallium Foundation of Canada to support training in palliative care to front-line health care workers, and this initiative is complementing a previous initiative called the way forward. This is aimed at integrating a palliative-care approach throughout the health care system and across a range of providers and settings.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318439">The federal government has also supported a number of initiatives to improve public awareness: health care professional education and training, national best practices, and standards and research. Federal investments in research also expand the depth and breadth of understanding of end-of-life-care issues and how best to address them. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4318440">Recently, the federal government provided $14 million over two years for the Canadian Foundation for Healthcare Improvement to support applied health services research, as well as the foundation's work to identify savings and efficiencies in the health care system, including a palliative care component. In budget 2016, the government also committed to making compassionate care benefits easier to access, more flexible, and inclusive for those who provide care for seriously ill family members, and more flexible parental leave benefits to better accommodate unique family and work situations.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318441">As with other health care services, delivery of palliative care is mainly the responsibility of the provinces and territories. While each province and territory has some level of palliative care services, with some moving ahead with frameworks or strategies, there are wide variances both within and between jurisdictions. Many are focusing on integrating palliative care with other types of care across settings and services. However, Canadians' ability to access palliative care remains mixed, depending on where one lives.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318442">The Government of Canada has committed to developing non-legislative measures that would support the improvement of a full range of options on end-of-life care. In the discussions with provincial and territorial governments toward developing a new health accord, our government has committed to provide $3 billion over the next four years to improve home care, including palliative care. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318443">I firmly believe my own experiences with end-of-life care are not unique from those of thousands upon thousands of Canadians. Losing my grandfather John, my mother, Gaye, and my Aunt Babs is something that has never left me. These people were titans in my life. My mom and Aunt Babs taught me everything I know about being passionate and determined, about giving of oneself to others, and about what it means to be a woman. They both had such a profound effect on every day of my life. I am here totally because of their legacy of excellence.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318444">Both of these women, who were so strong and committed to family and community, were so harmed as human beings by diseases that ravaged them. I learned what it meant to sleep on the floor day after day because they were afraid to be alone. I learned how to administer morphine and Ativan and that, if they even whimpered, I was to give more, as that meant they were still being torn apart inside.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318445">I learned how to raise or lower a home hospital bed. I learned how important palliative care is, to have access to it, but these are things I wish I had never had to learn. From all of them, I learned in those last days that there was no peace; there was only pain. There was no dignity, only terrible uncertainty. There was not nobility in their suffering. I learned pity.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318446">I am proud to stand in the House today and express my support for this critical piece of legislation. Not only does it respond to the decision by the Supreme Court of Canada in terms of amending the Criminal Code, but it also provides an excellent framework to facilitate the necessary changes to our health care system, which responds to this decision.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318447">Our government has listened to Canadians. Our government has listened to the experts. We have developed an approach that we believe reflects this input. It is now time to move forward with this legislation so that individuals, families, and health professionals have more options for end-of-life care, including medical assistance in dying.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

A synergy of wisdom and selflessness is needed in balancing what is perceived as best for me in relation to what is best for others. Just because we can, does not mean we should.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318465">As well, in determining if we should, it seems to me the wise approach would be to look at those who already did, and regret. This would require learning from recent history rather than pretending that what we are doing is somehow progressive, when it has already been proven to be a regressive decision elsewhere.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318466">The Supreme Court has chosen to ignore its own previous decision on the issue, along with six different parliaments that have previously rejected assisted suicide. It appears that the plumb line is not what is best for society and humanity as a whole, but rather what is the latest progressive trend that is putting the strongest pressure on how we live and relate as a society. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318467">I have been a pastor's wife, and a caregiver in hospitals and level 4 care homes. I have worked in a mental illness hospital. I have been an education aid for special needs children in kindergarten and high school students.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318468"> I am the daughter of a father with Alzheimer's, the grandmother of a high-achieving grandson with autism, and I have a loved one who is suffering with mental illness. I, too, am well aware of life's challenges. My personal belief is that life is sacred from conception to natural death, and the protection of the most vulnerable in our society must always be the determining factor in how we choose to govern and make laws in Canada. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318469">This is the expression as well that has been sent to me over and over again from constituents in my riding and across Canada, and today we need to have a debate in this House that is very balanced and presenting all views from all people in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318470">Life is challenging, and dying, far more often than not, is difficult for the one passing away and in some ways even more so for those experiencing end of life alongside the individual who is dying. I believe there is value in that as well. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318471">The misfortunate reality of Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> is that it will cause far greater grief than it will appease. Making something legal does not make it morally right. People who request a physician-assisted death can be motivated by a range of factors unrelated to their medical condition. These factors can make some people vulnerable to request assisted death when what they want and deserve is better treatment and palliative care.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318472">It needs to be pointed out that the Belgian euthanasia law does not apply to non-competent patients and it does not allow the deliberate shortening of their lives. The Belgium euthanasia law system, which Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> mirrors, has been proven to be abused and insufficient to monitor the decision-making process.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318473">For example, the <I>Journal of Medical Ethics</I> published a research article written by Raphael Cohen-Almagor, a human rights activist and chair of the politics department at the University of Hull. His article “First do no harm: intentionally shortening lives of patients without their explicit request in Belgium” focuses mainly on published data concerning the practice of causing death without patient request in Belgium.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318474"> The research indicates that the practice remains common, resulting in over 1,000 hastened deaths without request each year, or 32% of the cases of euthanasia. Moreover, in almost half of those cases the doctors refused to report the matter to the overseeing body, despite a legal requirement to do so.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318475"> This example clearly shows the legislation is lacking an oversight by an independent third party before the patient is put to death. Sadly, but realistically, the safeguards in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> are likely to be insufficient and ineffective in real life conditions. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="30">(1030)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4318476">Furthermore, Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> applies to those with physical or psychological illnesses who are experiencing enduring and intolerable suffering as a result of their medical condition. Our focus must first be on raising the quality and availability of high-quality palliative care as the humane way to relieve pain, loneliness, and fear for the end-of-life patient and to provide encouragement, direction, and support for loved ones through the natural process of end of life. Bill C-14 does not require a palliative care route be entered upon first, neither does it require the patient to have tried other treatments before requesting medical assistance to die. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318477">As well, I am still deeply concerned for our medical professionals who have contacted me in great numbers who could face severe consequences if they do not assist an individual to take their own life, for whatever reason. No one in our country should be forced to affirm or provide a service that goes against their conscience. The federal government's law leaves this crucial issue for the provinces to deal with, allowing even more interpretations of the general wording. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318478">There should be a structured national system to address the cases when a publicly funded health care organization or separate doctors are unwilling for any reason to provide aid in dying when the patient has requested it. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318479">Furthermore, the bill extends the amendments to the Criminal Code for medical practitioners, nurses, and registered practical nurses. Such an approach is broader than any other jurisdiction in the world and makes it impossible to create a transparent national system. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318480">It is necessary to take into consideration the psychological factors that Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> would actually influence and encourage. The secularism of our courts affirms a premise that everything is socially constructed, and as a result laws greatly shape the ethos of culture, affecting cultural attitudes toward certain behaviours and influencing moral norms. Medical assisted dying laws send a message that in certain conditions suicide is a reasonable and appropriate way out. The problem is that this message will be received not only by those who have painful, terminal illnesses, but also by those who are tempted to think they can no longer go on.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318481"> A study by David Jones and David Paton proved that legalizing assisted dying in other states has led to a rise in overall suicide rates, both assisted and unassisted. This greatly undermines the work of suicide prevention organizations and programs. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318482">As the Conservative deputy critic for veterans affairs and a member of the veterans affairs committee, I believe legalizing assisted suicide would only increase the challenges of providing mental health care and suicide prevention initiatives for those suffering from post traumatic stress injuries. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318483">I agree with my Liberal colleague from <Affiliation DbId="214668" Type="18">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> who spoke last evening that the government should at the very least postpone legalizing assisted death for at least five to 10 years, until it is absolutely clear what sort of impact it would have in all corners of Canada. His concern is well founded in regard to fighting the suicide spirit that needs to be healed on our reserves in Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318484">Another report in <I>Current Oncology</I> from 2011 summarized that euthanasia in the Netherlands has changed significantly in the 30 years since it was first adopted. It has shifted from medically assisted dying for people who are terminally ill to those who are chronically ill, from physical illness to those who suffer from mental illness, and then to those who suffer the psychological distress of mental suffering, and now to euthanasia of those over 70 who are simply tired of living. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318485">The culture now is that euthanasia becomes expected while palliative care and functional hospice is gradually portrayed and felt to be “selfish”. That is a quote from the UK <I>Daily Mail</I> on September 24, 2013. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318486">This implicates that the bill would not only affect those making a rational and deliberate choice to end their lives, but would also have a significantly wider impact on those who are required to provide such a service or their privilege and right to work in the medical field could be challenged, and also on wider social groups as a whole. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318487">When facing a choice, which we are with the bill, where should the priority for us as legislators be? The imposition by the Supreme Court of Canada to invoke such controversial legislation, which is proven to be failing in other countries; the approach of the committee to manage witnesses and to make recommendations that go far beyond the Carter decision; and the need to first of all institute high-quality palliative care as an intrinsic value and an actual clear priority of the government are all valid reasons that I feel I cannot support Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The government has committed to collecting and analyzing evidence regarding how medical assistance in dying is working in practice and considering the findings of independent studies into additional issues that were not addressed in the Carter decision, which will be launched after the bill is passed.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318507">Given the fundamental societal and medical issues that medical assistance in dying raises for our country, a cautious approach is in fact warranted. The stakes are just too high.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318508">The bill contains five key eligibility criteria.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318509"> First, the bill would also require that the person requesting medical assistance in dying be at least 18 years of age and be capable of making decisions with respect to their health. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318510">Several witnesses before the special joint committee, including the Canadian Paediatric Society, noted that medical assistance in dying raised unique considerations when it came to young people. Assessing a minor's capacity to decide to seek medical assistance in dying is difficult when the stakes are so high and the decision is irreversible. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318511">Importantly, the committee also heard that there was in fact no Canadian pediatric data regarding requests for medical assistance in dying from young people or whether pediatricians would be willing to participate in this procedure. Prudence and common sense support further study of this very difficult issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318512">With respect to capacity, this requirement means people must be able to confirm their choice at the time the medical assistance in dying is in fact provided. Therefore, the bill would not permit what are commonly called “advance requests”.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318513"> Permitting medical assistance in dying to be administered to a patient who is unable to express his or her wishes increases the risks of error and abuse. People who cannot express their wishes may want to continue living, even though they made a request at an earlier point in time.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318514">Simply put, an advance request takes away the right of people to change their minds when they lose capacity. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318515">The proposed approach also recognizes that physicians and health professionals frequently struggle with interpreting and applying other evidence directives in general. Advance requests for medical assistance in dying would be even more complicated to administer. Clearly, there is a need for further study and evidence concerning advance requests.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318516">The bill also contains eligibility criteria that people make a voluntary request for medical assistance in dying and that they do so with the benefit of fully informed consent.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318517">These requirements are common sense. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318518">Medical assistance in dying must not be an alternative in situations where patients might prefer a different treatment, but are not aware of it or they do not know their diagnosis or its likely trajectory. Nor must it be the product of external pressure or the person's believe that he or she is a burden or unwanted.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318519">Next, the bill would require that the person be suffering from a grievous and irremediable medical condition. This is defined term that has several characteristics, including the condition is serious and incurable; the person is in an advanced state of irreversible decline in capability; the condition is causing the person enduring suffering; and the person's natural death has become reasonably foreseeable in all of his or her medical circumstances, without requiring a specific prognosis.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="45">(1045)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4318520">The bill intends to permit medical assistance in dying as a choice for Canadians whose lives are on a path toward their end. As the Supreme Court suggested in various places in Carter, medical assistance in dying is similar in nature to forms of end-of-life care, such as palliative sedation, or the withdrawal of life-saving treatment. This definition is intended to allow for flexibility for physicians and nurse practitioners to consider all of the person's medical circumstance.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318521">Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> is clear that no specific prognosis of time remaining is required. Moreover, a person could qualify based on the cumulative effect of multiple conditions or medical circumstances that individually may not be fatal, but when taken together make the person's death reasonably foreseeable. For example, people in medical circumstances similar to those experienced by Kay Carter, Gloria Taylor, Sue Rodriguez, as well the people who have obtained individual constitutional exemptions across Canada since the Supreme Court's ruling this past January, would all be eligible under this bill.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318522">However, medical assistance in dying is not a solution to all forms of medical suffering. Such an approach would raise unacceptable risks, particularly for vulnerable people throughout our society. Take the example of someone who is exclusively suffering from a physical or mental disability, but who is otherwise in good health and whose natural death is still many years away. Making medical assistance in dying available to people in these circumstances risks reinforcing negative stereotypes of the lives lived by Canadians with disabilities, and could suggest that death is an acceptable alternative to any level of medical suffering or disability. This risks undermining our efforts to combat suicide, a pressing public health problem that affects not only those who die by suicide, but also their families, friends, and overall communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318523">Next, to ensure that Canadians can have confidence that medical assistance in dying is administered appropriately, the bill also contains the procedural safeguards generally in line with those recommended by the special joint committee. These measures would ensure that requests for medical assistance in dying would be made in writing, witnessed by two independent persons, and that there would be a 15-day wait period to guard against people making a decision too quickly, which cannot be reversed. In respect of the waiting period, there would be flexibility for situations where a person's death or loss of capacity was imminent.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318524">Most important, the eligibility of the person would have to be assessed and confirmed by two physicians or nurse practitioners who are independent of each other. The person would also have the right to change his or her mind about receiving medical assistance in dying, including just before the procedure would be administered. These safeguards will be effective at protecting Canadians but will not be so burdensome that they will impede access.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318525">Finally, the bill would require that the person be eligible for health services funded by a government in Canada. This requirement exists to ensure that Canada does not become a destination for people from around the world who visit the country solely for this purpose by obtaining medical assistance in dying. However, recognizing that Canadians often move from one province to another or sometimes live abroad for significant periods, the bill includes an exception to this requirement to ensure these people would not be excluded solely because they are subject to a waiting period or residency requirement for public health care.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318526">Medical assistance in dying is one of the most challenging and complex social and legal issues of our time, particularly given our society's aging population. However, the government has embraced this challenge and has listened carefully to the diverse perspectives of Canadians. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318527">The bill before Parliament today was crafted with both compassion and clear thinking, and represents thoughtful and principled legislation. It promises the autonomy of Canadians to choose medical assistance in dying, protects vulnerable persons, and respects the Supreme Court's decision.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318528">I call on members of the House to support this bill.</ParaText>

He very vociferously disagrees with that comment. Specifically, he focuses on the fact that the Supreme Court decision very clearly has said that physician-assisted death should be available to those who suffer purely from a grievous and irremediable condition. Yet, this legislation would go further than that and would add the additional requirement that the death be reasonably foreseeable. Mr. Arvay argued that was an unwarranted and illegitimate extension of the Supreme Court decision. In fact, he argued that the test of reasonably foreseeable death was specifically raised through the court process and rejected at all levels of the courts through this process.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318536">Could my hon. colleague tell us how he thinks the legislation would conform with the Supreme Court decision when it so clearly contradicts the Supreme Court's statement of the criteria required for access to physician-assisted death?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We have heard loud and clear that Canadians want a choice to ensure they make a proper decision after discussing these issues with their physicians, their family, and their friends.

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Davies" id="8888586"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="213868" Type="2">Mr. Don Davies (Vancouver Kingsway, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4318539">Madam Speaker, I want to begin my remarks by acknowledging the delicacy, sensitivity, and grace that the subject before us requires. The subject matter of this debate, assisted dying, raises issues of the most profound importance, indeed of life and death. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318540">They engage our deepest sentiments not only as parliamentarians but as humans. They involve our conscience, our morality, our ethics, our values, our philosophies, our spirituality, our individuality, and our dignity. I believe we must approach these issues with the utmost care, compassion, and respect, because Canadians have diverse and deeply held views on this matter, all worthy of consideration and deference.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318541">The context of the debate is clear: death is feared, suffering is feared, loss of control is feared. With the advances in modern medicine, people today can, and indeed must, contemplate living without an acceptable quality of life, of being alive but not living, of possessing basic bodily functions without agency, without dignity, without hope.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318542">At the same time, we fear the diminution of the sanctity of life, of the possibility of abuse of the vulnerable among us, embarking on a slippery slope that challenges long-standing foundational tenets of respect for the preservation of human life. This debate is about a fundamental collision of values, one which is based on the instinct to live and to preserve life in all instances, and the other premised on the right to control our inevitable passing as an inherent aspect of our individualism and personal liberty.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318543">I hope that we treat the issues involved in this debate with the compassion and respect that they deserve, because we must simultaneously balance the notions of death with dignity with life with dignity. There will be no right or wrong here. There is only the possibility of compromise, understanding, and moving forward with as much wisdom and sensitivity as possible. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318544">In many ways, we have taken an unfortunate path to the present. We are here by virtue of the legal process. It was based on a rights-based analysis and decision engendered by the mandate of a court, quite legitimately, because of a charter-based argument that challenged criminal provisions as violating individual constitutional rights. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318545">We are not here because of a discussion based on faith, or conscience, or ethics. This has left many Canadians feeling rushed and robbed of the kind of full debate that perhaps ought to have been conducted on a matter of such social depth. As such, we are here debating not if, but how assisted death might best be implemented. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318546">However, I do take comfort in the fact that the Supreme Court of Canada arrived at its decision unanimously, something that does not commonly occur. This gives me confidence that the most learned jurists in our nation were certain that we, as parliamentarians, can and must construct a system that allows Canadians to seek and obtain the assistance of their medical providers in ending their lives in tightly defined circumstances.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318547">I would like to address my comments and thoughts on two areas: palliative care, and key aspects of this legislation. I am the health critic for the New Democratic Party and, as such, I approach this issue not only from a values or ethical or moral perspective, but from a health care point of view. I believe one of the most central aspects of the debate before us must revolve around palliative care. If we are honest, we will acknowledge that we as a nation have failed to construct the range and quality of end-of-life care that is essential to provide Canadians with the confidence they need to live their lives to the fullest extent.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318548">We as a society have been remiss, slow to develop a system of palliative care that is so essential when we contemplate end-of-life issues. If we are to do our best to create the conditions where Canadians avail themselves of assisted death only in the rarest of circumstances, we must focus on achieving a number of things.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318549">We must create pain-management programs to ensure that we have the widest possible resources to make everyone comfortable, regardless of their medical condition or proximity to end of life. We must develop home care resources to ensure that folks, especially seniors, can live their remaining days in the comfort of their personal surroundings, communities, memories, friends, and families.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="00">(1100)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4318550">We must construct palliative units across our country that allow people who are approaching their end to have environments that are comfortable, enriching, graceful, and interesting, and where spouses, children, families, and friends can be together in respectful private settings. They should have the very best medical care a developed country like Canada can muster. If we were to invest in world-class palliative care, we would likely see relatively few Canadians seeking assisted death.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318551">Regardless of where one is placed on this debate, I think we all agree that we should be trying our best to encourage all Canadians to choose to live their lives to the fullest. This bill, the government, and its recent budget have thus far failed to identify and provide the resources needed to make a world-class palliative care system a reality in this country. Talk is not enough, and this must change. As New Democrats, we will work ceaselessly to press the government to allocate the resources necessary to build a world-class palliative care system across Canada. We will press the governments of every province and territory to work together to ensure that this system is available to all Canadians, regardless of where they live.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318552">I have some key observations.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318553">I personally believe that competent adults have the right to determine the conditions of their passing in the circumstances identified by the Supreme Court, namely where they face a grievous and irremediable medical condition that they find intolerable, and with a carefully designed and secure process that ensures their wishes can be ascertained with certainty. To the extent that this legislation deviates from that decision, it must be amended.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318554"> If it is truly the case that the prime successful litigant in the Supreme Court case, Ms. Kay Carter, would not be permitted a physician-assisted passing under this legislation, that is patently wrong. I believe we must tread extremely cautiously in this area and move very deliberately.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318555">While I have listened carefully to those who favour a broad expansion of assisted death beyond the Supreme Court's careful parameters, I do not agree. In my view, care and caution are required in such delicate matters. Very difficult considerations accompany the issues of mature minors, psychological suffering, and advance consent. I believe it is the wisest course to engage fully with Canadians prior to legislating in these areas. We are moving from a society that has observed criminal sanctions for suicide and assisted death for centuries, to one which is constructing a system in response to the circumstances presented to the Supreme Court in the Carter case. In my view, this is sufficient for the moment, and we ought to focus our efforts on ensuring that the Carter principles are properly enshrined in law. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318556">As the father of a child with special needs, I want to ensure that every vulnerable Canadian is fully protected with respect to all circumstances in this area. I am sympathetic to those who fear a slide down a slippery slope that puts vulnerable Canadians at risk, and I agree that we must ensure tight parameters are in place to prevent this. I believe that we can and must explicitly ensure that medical personnel and institutions have their rights of faith and conscience fully protected. Just as I believe that Canadians who wish to exercise their charter rights to access assisted dying must be respected, so too must those who choose not to be involved in such matters because of their faith or values not be compelled to do so. The constitutional rights of some Canadians must not be enforced at the cost and by the diminution of the constitutional rights of other Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318557"> I further believe that faith-based health institutions are direct extensions of the faith communities and groups that sponsor them and, as such, constitute expressions of values that are eminently worthy of protection. I believe we can ensure that all Canadians have access to their Carter rights while also protecting the equally important rights of those who may have conscientious objections to participating in any way in them.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318558">In the end, it is my fundamental conviction that we as parliamentarians can and must craft legislation that reflects the best of who we are as Canadians: people who cherish individual rights and liberties, people who care deeply about each other, people who are compassionate and concerned with justice, and people who are dedicated to making our society one that is ruled by law, by wisdom, and by respect for all.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318559">I will do my very best to reflect these values as we craft this important legislation for Canadians.</ParaText>

What had to be determined is what kind of legislation we were going to introduce.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318579">The Supreme Court's decision meant an important shift in our society's perception of personal autonomy. It signalled that a person's sense of dignity is intricately tied to how one perceives his or her quality of life. The decision to allow Canadians the choice of medical assistance in dying sheds light on the evolving role of our health care system and the role of patients in decision-making.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318580">Canadians are looking to their doctors and nurses to provide health care, and to help them maintain their quality of life. However, when that quality is no longer attainable, Canadians want to know that their health care providers will also help them when their choice is a dignified end to their lives.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318581">In addition to the consultation, I have received many letters from residents in Davenport. There are those who believe there should be no legislation at all, others who think that the proposed bill is not strong enough in protecting the conscience rights of doctors or in protecting the most vulnerable, and a further group who worry that the legislation does not go far enough, that we as a government have been too narrow in our interpretation of the Supreme Court decision. I will address all these concerns in the next few minutes.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318582"> Let me first address those who do not believe there should be any legislation. What many may not understand is that if the Liberal government does not create a new law by June 6 of this year, it means medical assistance in dying is legal if it is conducted in a way that adheres to the considerations outlined by the Supreme Court in its Carter ruling. Canadians would then not have any national framework and no law, which in my opinion would lead to a wild west, where it would be up to any one person's interpretation of the Carter decision and a situation that I believe would be open to abuse.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318583">In introducing Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, the Liberal government purposely created legislation which as narrowly as possible adhered to the Supreme Court decision. It is narrow because this bill is meant to be a first step. It is meant to ground the legislation properly.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318584"> The legislation would do three things. It would allow physicians, nurses, and those who help them provide assistance in dying to eligible patients without the risk of being charged. It would also provide safeguards to make sure that those who receive medical assistance in dying are eligible, can give informed consent, and voluntarily request it. Finally, it would lay the foundation for the Minister of Health to make regulations to establish a process for monitoring and reporting on the use of medical assistance in dying. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4318585">I will pause for a second to reiterate the first point, because as mentioned, many have written to me to express their concern that the legislation as drafted does not protect the conscience rights of doctors. I want to be clear that there is nothing in the legislation that compels any medical practitioner or authorized nurse practitioner to provide medical assistance in dying or to refer a patient to another medical practitioner. The legislation is meant to balance access to medical assistance in dying while respecting the personal convictions of health care providers. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318586">The legislation is also clear on who is eligible. A person has to be mentally competent, 18 years of age or over, make a voluntary request, and give informed consent to receive medical assistance in dying. They have to have a serious and incurable illness, disease or disability, be in an advanced state of irreversible decline in capability, experiencing and enduring intolerable suffering as a result of their medical condition, and be on a course toward the end of life. Death would have to be reasonably foreseeable in all of the circumstances of the person's health.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318587">Protective measures are also a key part of the legislation to ensure that patients eligible have given informed consent. Patients have to make a written request for medical assistance in dying and have it signed by two independent witnesses. Also, two independent medical opinions have to confirm that the patient meets all the criteria. These first two criteria are intended to ensure that requests for medical assistance in dying are truly voluntary, that they reflect the wishes of the patient and are not made as a result of external pressure or coercion.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318588">Too many of my constituents have said to me, “My dad was in the hospital. We kind of felt forced that maybe we would want to sort of end things.” I said that this legislation does not help with that. The patient has to make a written request. It has to be signed by two independent witnesses, and there has to be two independent medical opinions.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318589">In addition, the second criterion also helps to reassure the medical practitioner who would provide medical assistance in dying that he or she is acting within the scope of the law and consistent with reasonable medical knowledge and skill.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318590">The other criteria for patients to be eligible are that there is a mandatory 15-day waiting period; the patient has the right to withdraw a request at any time; and consent must be confirmed immediately before medical assistance in dying is provided. It is a very thoughtful protocol with very strong safeguards.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318591">As part of this legislation, the foundation is also laid for the <Affiliation DbId="214328" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> to establish a process for monitoring and reporting on the use of medical assistance in dying. We need to know, and Canadians need to be satisfied, that the system is operating as planned to respect the autonomy for eligible individuals while protecting vulnerable people.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318592">Public trust and transparency in the implementation of medical assistance in dying are essential. This monitoring and reporting system will also be able to signal any issues or unexpected consequences. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318593">Monitoring would also ensure that high-quality comparable Canadian data are generated so that any future discussions about changes to the medical assistance in dying system could be made based on the best possible evidence. Indeed, there will be a review of the legislation in five years, which could bring about changes that reflect the data gathered in this period.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318594">For those who believe that this legislation has not gone far enough, there is a commitment to independent studies into three key issues that the Supreme Court of Canada in Carter declined to address. The first was the eligibility for persons under the age of 18. The second is the advance request. The third is requests for medical assistance in dying solely on the basis of mental illness.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318595"> It is also important to mention that palliative care, ensuring that all Canadians live as well as possible until their death, is equally important to this government. Just yesterday the <Affiliation DbId="214328" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> stood in this House to reaffirm our commitment to $3 billion over four years for home care. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318596">The minister is working hard with her counterparts across Canada on the next version of our health care accord, and high-quality palliative care for all Canadians is a key part of their deliberations.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318597">I also should mention that one of the great positive side effects of introducing this legislation is that we are having a wide discussion on a national level. We need to be discussing this issue fully and we need to be understanding it.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318598">In closing, I want to quickly thank and commend the great work that was done by the Special Joint Committee on Medical Assistance in Dying under the great leadership of my colleague, the MP for <Affiliation DbId="214013" Type="2">Don Valley West</Affiliation>. I also thank the <Affiliation DbId="214321" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="214328" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> for their excellent work in introducing this legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318599"> Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> is meant to be a legislative foundation on which we will build moving forward . It recognizes the inherent and equal value of every life, and it honours the dignity and the autonomy of an eligible person to choose medical assistance in dying under well-defined rules and conditions. It is the right legislation for Canadian society today, and I will be supporting this legislation.</ParaText>

While I may not agree with all the points that have been made thus far, I do not doubt for one second that the comments of all members are truly heartfelt, genuine, reflective, and respectful.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318614">Unfortunately, I do not have time to address all the concerns of the bill, such as, but not limited to—as my colleague the member for <Affiliation DbId="214456" Type="2">Lethbridge</Affiliation> has so eloquently articulated—the poisonous change in our cultural mindset the bill will likely encourage, reducing the value of life to a measure of ability or function rather than its inherent worth and dignity, and causing Canadians who would never have considered taking their own life before to do so.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318615">As the member for <Affiliation DbId="213903" Type="2">Scarborough—Guildwood</Affiliation> mentioned, the bill would be under expansionary pressure from the day it comes into effect, and where we could end up is troubling.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318616">The peril that I do not think has been fully addressed is that in which those in vulnerable communities could find themselves.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318617">As I said, because time is limited, I am going to focus upon two issues, but again, my serious concerns are not limited to these alone. First is the regrettable absence of more discussion and action on palliative and hospice care as a precursor to this legislation. Second is the need and the duty of all members here to respect and protect those physicians and health care professionals who object on conscience.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318618">Before I get into these two points, I want to offer my reflections on where we have come from on this issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318619">It was only six years ago that we debated the same issue and voted down the private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="4328668" Type="4">C-384</Document>, of a former member of this House. It should be noted that this was the second attempt at the same private member's bill by the former member, who had previously introduced Bill <Document DbId="1930475" Type="4">C-407</Document>. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318620">I will say that I voted against and spoke out against the bills, not only because of my own personal convictions, but also because of my steadfast belief that those bills did not uphold the moral obligation we have as parliamentarians to protect the vulnerable and the inherent dignity of all life.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318621">Bill <Document DbId="4328668" Type="4">C-384</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="1930475" Type="4">C-407</Document> were seriously flawed because they sent us down a path of unintended consequences. They were that slippery slope that has so often been spoken of here in this chamber, regarding the debate of ethical dilemmas that our families, doctors, and health care workers would face.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318622">My reservation then is sustained today. Why is there not more emphasis on palliative care?</ParaText><ParaText id="4318623">Is it not better to support quality palliative and end-of-life care for Canadians, so they will never need to think that euthanasia or assisted suicide is the only option, or better option, for their suffering?</ParaText><ParaText id="4318624">Is it not our duty to uphold the value and dignity of life in this manner?</ParaText><ParaText id="4318625">In my own home community of Hamilton, we have outstanding organizations like Emmanuel House and the Dr. Bob Kemp Hospice, which work on a daily basis to make end of life better for people. I know hospices are doing outstanding work in all the communities across this country.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318626">I recognize that, in the view of the Supreme Court's Carter decision, we are faced with a new reality, one where we need to respect its decision vis-à-vis the charter rights of those in dire circumstances while still ensuring the dignity of life is upheld. However, I am very concerned that there was no further investigation, no rigorous effort to enhance palliative care and invest in hospice construction, in advance of this legislation or in conjunction with it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318627">While the federal government's response to the Supreme Court's Carter decision makes reference to the need to support improvements of a full range of end-of-life care options, it does little about it, other than acknowledging it as a non-legislative response.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318628">I do not think that is good enough, and I believe all Canadians do not think that is good enough either.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318629">Instead of a vague reference to a multi-year health accord that would include home care and palliative care as one option, where was the commitment in the throne speech? Where was the commitment in the budget?</ParaText><ParaText id="4318630">If the commitment is serious, why is it not backed up with funding?</ParaText><ParaText id="4318631">This is the missing piece. If we are going to go down the legislative path of physician-assisted dying because of charter rights, then we in this place have a duty, and the Government of Canada has a duty, to have first acted upon palliative and hospice care.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4318632">That was the viewpoint of two Senate studies, which I cited back in 2010 when I spoke out against Bill <Document DbId="4328668" Type="4">C-384</Document>. First, in 1995, there was the Special Senate Committee on Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide that in its report, “Of Life and Death”, made a number of recommendations to improve access to palliative care services, standards of care, and training of health care professionals.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318633">In 2000, the Standing Senate Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology tabled another report, titled “Quality End-of-Life Care: The Right of Every Canadian”, which again recommended a strategy and vast improvements to palliative and end-of-life care, as well as support for family caregivers, home care, research, and surveillance.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318634">It breaks my heart, and I know the hearts of all members in the House, that people are suffering. Just this past summer, in the middle of the election campaign, I watched my own younger brother succumb to the ravages of lymphatic cancer, and I was grateful for the care, understanding, and compassion of everyone at Emmanuel House, the hospice where he stayed in his final days.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318635">I know that this bill attempts to address those individuals who have given up hope; yet I believe there are, most often, better ways to address their suffering. It is our obligation to do everything possible with palliative and hospice care, to give a modicum of hope, comfort, and peace to those suffering at the end of their lives and to their families who are also suffering. Once again, I believe this discussion should have preceded this bill. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318636">The final point I want to touch on today is one that I know other members have already raised, but please allow me to amplify their concerns. That is the protection of physicians' conscience rights and, quite frankly, those of the other health care professionals and caregivers on a doctor's team who might be placed in the circumstances that this bill would allow.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318637">First, I do not think there is a shred of doubt that we must offer clear and indisputable protections to those who object on ethical, moral, or religious grounds. In these matters of life and death, that is more than the right thing to do; it is the only thing to do.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318638">Second, I believe that, to send this important signal to the medical community, families, individuals who are suffering, and all Canadians, these conscience protections for physicians must be included in the bill itself, and not just in the preamble. The bill needs to include a punitive measure for those who would seek to pressure, force, or coerce anyone to assist someone in taking his or her life. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318639">I am thankful for the opportunity to offer these reflections. I know every member of the House will be doing a lot of thinking, soul searching, and prayerful consideration as we grapple with this legislation. I sincerely hope and pray that we continue to do so with extreme caution and care. God bless Canada.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We have a deadline of June 6. There is a great expectation that the bill will be going to committee stage at some point, and my question is related to that.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318642">The member referenced the importance of there possibly being amendments to the bill. The Government of Canada is, in fact, open to ideas, suggestions, and presentations at the committee stage, and I am wondering if the member wants to comment on how important it is that the bill goes to committee in a timely fashion so that the committee is able to do some of the things that might be of benefit if the legislation is improved. I am sure the member will find that the government is willing to improve the legislation. No one on this side is going to oppose healthier and stronger legislation.</ParaText>

The fact is that we have this June 6 date looming over us while we are dealing with such a huge question; that of life itself. It is a question that the Province of Quebec took six years to deal with. It is a question that the country of Belgium took 10 years to deal with. However, we have deal with it now in such a short time frame, and I understand the expeditious manner in which we have to proceed. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318645">That said, I think it was incumbent upon the Liberals, prior to tabling this legislation, that their own principles that they mentioned in their own platform should have been part of this legislation or should have even preceded this legislation in the sense of making sure that every Canadian had the better option, the option to be able to go to a place where they are loved, and for those people who do not have any family, places where they could get relief from their pain and be with people who care for them right to their last days. That was not included in this legislation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318646"> I hope the Liberals would be open to making sure that part of their infrastructure dollars would be set aside for hospice construction, and that they would also be negotiating specifically with provinces right now to delineate funds specifically for palliative care so that the service is enhanced rather than it going into the general fund of provinces and not seeing the light of day to serve people who need it.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Everyone is concerned about the well-being of people who are at the end of their lives, and everyone wants the best for them. However, just because we want to care does not necessary mean that we do what is best for people. We are not necessarily doing what is best for someone if we infringe on a person's autonomy and self-determination.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318654">In the moral sense of the term, human dignity is connected to respect for self-determination. That should be the basis of our debate. Yesterday, in committee, I heard people say that we should consider a person's dignity in relation to their illness. They were talking about whether the person is wearing diapers, which is just frightening. Only that individual can make judgments about their own quality of life, and we cannot compare one life to another. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318655">By way of introduction, since Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> is quite similar to part of the Quebec law, I would like to provide some context regarding the basis of that law. At the request of medical specialists and other civil society groups in Quebec, in the fall of 2009, the Quebec National Assembly created a deliberative space in order to give people the opportunity to express their views on an issue that could not be more personal: their own end of life.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318656">From that moment on, the status quo was no longer an option for Quebec parliamentarians. Five years later, on June 5, 2014, the National Assembly passed Bill 52, The Act Respecting End-of-Life Care. One aspect of that act is medical assistance in dying.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318657">This work was guided by two premises. First, my death, like my life, is my own. Second, the autonomy bestowed on a person by law through the principle of self-determination and its corollary rule of free and informed consent, which applies in biomedical contexts, is never questioned throughout that person's life, even in times of weakness or extreme emergency. Why then would things be any different at the end of a person's life?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318658">Why would a person's right to self-determination be taken away because he or she is terminally ill? On what grounds would that be done? Is there any more personal and unique time in a person's life than the moment of death? What more could we wish than for a person to be able to calmly and peacefully pass on into death without any fear of suffering or any actual suffering? Is that not what we all hope for and what we would wish for any human being?</ParaText><ParaText id="4318659">The consensus that was reached in Quebec was to make these premises part of a continuum of care, so that palliative care and euthanasia, two realities in the history of this issue, would no longer be set in opposition to each other. Why pit palliative care and euthanasia against each other? This question has been implicit in many of my Conservative colleague's speeches, because unlike in Quebec, we did not hold a debate on the right to die, which used to be associated with passive euthanasia. </ParaText>

At the time, paternalistic doctors tended to focus on the curative aspect, and people were dying from the chemotherapy, not the cancer. Over the years, there has been a shift from passive euthanasia to palliative care. Human beings have thus acquired the right to die.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318661">Palliative care is about taking a holistic approach to end-of-life care. This concept was developed by Cicely Saunders, in England, and dates back to 1967. Why should a request for assisted dying arising out of a positive experience of care near the end of one's life be considered a failure? The dying process has started and is irreversible.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318662">A person might wake up one morning and decide that he or she is ready to give up. A person might also decide that that is not the case and that he or she wants to go on living, and die a slow death. The Quebec legislation in no way precludes one or the other, because it places end-of-life care in a continuum of care.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318663">For more than 30 years, palliative care was considered the only way to die with dignity at the end of one's life. It became apparent that such care did not meet every need. Most requests for medical assistance in dying are made as part of the process of palliative care. Very rarely does a person who receives a terminal diagnosis from a doctor immediately request an injection. If so, it all depends on the stage of the cancer. The patient might be put on anti-depressants and told to get his or her affairs in order. There are things that a person needs to do before dying.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318664">One of the difficulties with Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> is that it groups together two realities under medical assistance in dying. One is covered by Quebec, namely euthanasia and end-of-life care, which includes palliative care; the other is assisted suicide. This choice is causing the conceptual confusion that leads to the impasse in our debates.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318665">Assisted suicide is not euthanasia. The difference is that a person can be at the terminal phase of a degenerative disease without being near death. A person can suffer tremendously without being in a situation of reasonably foreseeable natural death.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318666">The Supreme Court has asked legislators to provide a framework for assisted suicide. This is what the Supreme Court told us in section 7:</ParaText><ParaText id="4318667"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Insofar as they prohibit physician-assisted dying for competent adults who seek such assistance as a result of a grievous and irremediable medical condition that causes enduring and intolerable suffering, ss. 241 (<I>b</I>) and 14 of the Criminal Code deprive these adults of their right to life, liberty and security of the person under s. 7 of the Charter. The right to life is engaged where the law or state action imposes death or an increased risk of death on a person, either directly or indirectly. Here, the prohibition deprives some individuals of life, as it has the effect of forcing some individuals to take their own lives prematurely, for fear that they would be incapable of doing so when they reached the point where suffering was intolerable. <I/></QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>

If you decide you have dignity, then you do, and perhaps if you decide you do not have dignity, then you do not. I find this definition rather troubling. First, there is no regime of assisted suicide proposed here or anywhere else that defines dignity in this wholly subjective way. It still tries to say that a person who has these physical or psychological symptoms can have dignity and someone without those symptoms cannot. It would seem that the typical understanding of dignity in this legislation and elsewhere does look for these external markers.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318675">I liked what my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="214107" Type="2">Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier</Affiliation> had to say yesterday about dignity being intrinsic to all human beings, because if we interpret dignity in the subjective way that the member has, I wonder where that leaves any efforts at suicide prevention.

One of the principles we have in the House is that legislation is best built on a very solid foundation, and this bill does not have that. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318680">What the Supreme Court ruled years ago on the Rodriguez case was very clear. However, just over a year ago, as with so many other decisions and so many other directions, the Supreme Court reversed itself. If it had really good underlying reasons for doing that, it would have been fine, but the justification for it was very interesting. It was a mistake in perception as set forward by the Supreme Court. The justices called it a changing matrix of social and legal facts which brought them to their conclusion. I and others are concerned that this makes our laws, including the interpretation of charter rights, dependent upon the opinions of a very small group of people. I will talk a bit more about the matrix of social and legal facts in a few minutes.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318681">From my perspective, this is not an improvement. Many of my colleagues on both sides of the House have shared their concerns about Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, with some supporting it and others opposing it. However, a number of things are missing in the bill, and we need to have further discussion about. I heard a few comments earlier about the timeline, how pressured it was, how we needed to get this done and that this basically was prohibiting us from taking the time needed to discuss these things a bit further and with a bit more depth.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318682">There is no clear definition of what irremediable means. The bill talks about that being the requirement for someone to qualify for physician-assisted dying.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318683">I am concerned about the expansion of this process to nurse practitioners, so it would not just include physicians. People have asked why medical personnel are even involved with this. They have asked whether there is not some other place this can be done so people do not have to be concerned that when they go into the hospital for medical care, rather than receiving a positive side of medical care, they receive a very negative side of it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318684"> There is a criminal exemption for those who perform euthanasia, but there is no protection for those who do not want to participate. A number of people are very concerned about what is called conscience rights and the lack of protection for that in the legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318685">There is a lack of clarity around psychological conditions and how that may come into play with this issue. One of the things that really concerns a lot of people is the lack of a vulnerability assessment, taking the time to find out if people are being pressured or whether there is some vulnerability that is bringing them to the point where they have made a decision that may be wrong for them. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318686">Some people have called for a prior judicial review. There is no mention of that in the legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318687">Also, there is a lack of clarity on data collection. This has been an issue in a number of areas. Will we see good data collection? Will someone keep a good set of records on what goes on with this process?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318688">We often have heard the concern that there is no clear commitment to palliative care. We just heard a member from the government talk about this. The Liberals made this commitment during the election campaign. They felt it was within their jurisdiction to promise $3 billion toward palliative care, but now, in the House, we hear them talk about how other jurisdictions are responsible for this. It sounds as if the Liberals are trying to avoid their responsibilities for this.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318689">I would like to go back to the Supreme Court decision. It turned back the former position. It reversed it and it left us with an open field when it came to the issue of assisted suicide or assisted dying. The only thing the Supreme Court said in its ruling on Carter was that the person needed to consent and that the person needed to have a grievous and irremediable medical condition causing enduring and intolerable suffering. If we look at that, we see it leaves that whole area very open. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318690">As I said earlier, good legislation should have a good foundation. I do not believe this does because of the Supreme Court decision. The foundation is the Carter decision and it hardly qualifies as a stable base on which to create good legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318691">I do not suppose we will get this done today, but we will come back at another stage on this bill. However. I would like to take a few minutes to talk a bit about the Supreme Court's recent decision in Carter v. Canada. It obviously is a very controversial decision and touches on a sensitive issue for many Canadians because there are very deeply held beliefs on both sides of this issue.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="00">(1200)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4318692">The Supreme Court acknowledged that the prohibition on assisted suicide was in general a valid exercise of federal criminal law. It also decided that the law went too far and it did not apply in cases where a competent adult with a grievous medical condition could consent to the termination of his or her life. I believe this decision is disturbing for a number of reasons.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318693">The first is that the court ignored parliamentary consensus. In its decision, it claimed that the reversal from its earlier position in Rodriguez v. B.C. was necessary because of a different matrix of legislative and social facts. Yet, the purported differing matrix ignores the clear and unchanged parliamentary consensus opposing assisted suicide. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318694">Between 1991 and 2012, nine private members' bills were introduced in the House of Commons, all seeking to amend the Criminal Code to decriminalize assisted suicide or euthanasia. Six were voted on and all of them failed to pass. When considering the matrix of legislative facts, the court gave weight to legislative developments in Belgium, Switzerland, Oregon, Washington, and the Netherlands, but it completely ignored the legislative record of Canada's Parliament.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318695">Second, the court found no societal consensus in Canada on this issue. In her decision at the trial level of Carter v. Canada in the Supreme Court of B.C., Justice Smith wrote, “As to physician-assisted death, weighing all of the evidence, I do not find that there is a clear societal consensus either way”. Clearly whatever the change in that matrix of legal and social facts entails, it did not include a clear consensus from the people of Canada”.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318696">This lack of consensus remains unchanged in the 22 years since the Rodriguez case in which the court stated, “No consensus can be found in favour of the decriminalization of assisted suicide. To the extent that there is a consensus, it is that human life must be respected”. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318697">Clearly, the court found no consensus among western countries. While insisting again this matrix of legislative and social facts had changed since the last Supreme Court ruling on the issue, it acknowledged that physician-assisted dying remained a criminal offence in most western countries. Regardless, it chose to align itself with the minority of jurisdictions that allowed it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318698">I believe the court misinterpreted Parliament's objective in prohibiting assisted suicide. In its ruling, it put significant weight on the parliamentary objective of two sections, section 241(b) and 14 of the Criminal Code, which prohibit assisted suicide. The court asserted that these sections were put in place only to fulfill the state interest in protecting the vulnerable. However, in the earlier court case with Rodriguez, the court had said the objective of this section was not simply “protecting the vulnerable”, but also “preserving life”.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318699">It had written, “In this case, it is not disputed that in general s.241(b) is valid and desirable legislation which fulfils the government's objectives of preserving life and protecting the vulnerable”. This position was reaffirmed several times. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318700">By insisting that in Carter the purpose of section 241 was only to protect the vulnerable, the Supreme Court was able to conclude that this prohibition put people outside this class and that there were people who did not need to be protected by it. The court's conclusion was that the current law was over broad and grossly disproportionate to its objectives. That allowed it to say that Parliament needed to establish safeguards to ensure that those who truly wanted to be euthanized would be able to do that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318701">That interpretation tramples on the intention of Parliament to preserve life. Had it considered the full purpose of these sections of the Criminal Code rather than just that one objective of protecting the vulnerable, I think the outcome would have been very different.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318702">I would make one final point before my time runs out. The court really leaves the definition of irremediable open to patient interpretation. The court decided that irremediable did not require the patient to undertake treatments that were not acceptable to them. In other words, although treatment may be available, the condition still qualifies as irremediable if the treatment is not acceptable to the patient.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318703">I wanted to express my concerns. However, I think we will come back to some of the things the Supreme Court touched on as well in terms of the right to die being conflated with the right to life and some of the other issues.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

These personal stories help us to add context. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318741">Unfortunately, because of the lack of palliative care that we have in this country, there are many cases where a person may think or be told that their pain is not manageable when in fact their pain is manageable. This is why I think we need a greater emphasis on palliative care and pain management. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318742">I want to ask specifically about dealing with palliative care in the context of the legislation before us. We have heard that there is a commitment, not in this budget but at some point in the future, to make investments in palliative care. Most of us think that is a good thing.

This legislation includes additional criteria beyond the Supreme Court's instructions, including requiring that death be easily foreseeable. That has led to the perverse situation where Ms. Carter, the litigant in that case, likely would not be able to avail herself of assisted death, even though she successfully won the case.

Developing a framework for medical assistance in dying means striking a balance between implementing a right with such irrevocable consequences on the one hand, and protecting vulnerable people with regard to that right on the other hand.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318755">What right are we talking about? It is the right of a competent adult, who freely consents and suffers from a grievous and irremediable illness causing intolerable suffering, to die at the time of their choosing and with the necessary assistance and medical support. This is a right guaranteed by section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which states that everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of the person. This right was unanimously recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada on February 6, 2015, in the Carter case. This right protects life, because the absolute prohibition in section 14 and paragraph 241(<I>b</I>) of the Criminal Code on aiding or counselling another person to commit suicide made individuals suffering from grievous and irremediable illness feel that they were forced to take their own lives prematurely out of fear that the progression of their illness would make it impossible for them to do so and that their suffering would become intolerable.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318756">The absolute nature of the blanket prohibition on medical assistance in dying deprived people of a portion of their life that they could otherwise have enjoyed. This right also protects the liberty and security of the person.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318757">As the Supreme Court explained in paragraph 66 of its decision in Carter, by denying people the right to request a physician’s assistance in dying, the Criminal Code is interfering with “their ability to make decisions concerning their bodily integrity and medical care”. The Criminal Code thus trenches on liberty. Since that option was not available to Canadians, they had to endure intolerable suffering, which also impinged on their right to security of the person.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318758">Although the Supreme Court recognized that medical assistance in dying is one of the rights guaranteed under section 7 of the charter, those rights are not absolute. Limitations and restrictions can be placed on those rights, according to the principle set out in Oakes, which is based on section 1 of the charter. The principles in question are those of minimal impairment and an important government objective.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318759">Bill C-14 must be examined through that lens. Although people with grievous and irremediable medical conditions should be given the right and means to die with dignity, that is not an absolute right. We also need to protect vulnerable people, people who are unable to provide informed consent, and people who could be subject to undue pressure.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318760">My position could evolve, as I continue to listen to my colleagues and constituents and as I continue to reflect on this topic.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318761">However, I think that it is a good idea to exclude minors and people with mental illness from this bill. Like many members in the House, and like the Quebec National Assembly when their work was complete, I think that including minors would have created some virtually insurmountable problems with respect to consent, as my Conservative colleague from <Affiliation DbId="213959" Type="2">Louis-Saint-Laurent</Affiliation> pointed out.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318762">With respect to people with mental illness, I think that in the absence of full and informed consent, the sanctity of life must prevail. Since such consent is nearly impossible to obtain under the circumstances, it is prudent to exclude people with mental illness from the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318763">Conversely, I think that some aspects of the bill raise some questions. One aspect is the notion of a death that is reasonably foreseeable, which the government wants to introduce, even though this notion was not in the Carter decision.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318764">The court recognized that not having access to medical assistance in dying could cause intolerable suffering and, therefore, impinges on the individual's right to security of the person.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318765">I also think that individuals who are suffering from a grievous and irremediable medical condition but who are not at the end of their life, which unfortunately is the case for many people in Canada, are therefore being deprived of the right to security and integrity of the person.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318766">I am afraid that with this addition, one of the appellants in Carter would not have had access to medical assistance in dying. I am not certain either that such a restriction minimally impairs a charter right, as seen in Oakes. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4318767">Second, although I am aware that there is a need for robust protections and that the bill includes many, which is a good thing most certainly, I have doubts about the protection provided by the provision in paragraph 241.2(3)(<I>h</I>), which stipulates that immediately before medical assistance in dying is provided, a patient must reiterate his or her free, informed, and full consent.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318768">Doctors would have to stop administering medication, such as morphine, which eases the patient's pain, in order to obtain this full consent. I fear that this provision will create excessive suffering for individuals at a moment when they want to gently leave behind their overwhelming suffering.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318769">Third, I was not convinced that advance consent was a good idea, but I was enlightened by my colleagues. Although I am still not convinced, I welcome the government's willingness to study the issue further.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318770">Lastly, like many of my constituents, I think medical assistance in dying must be brought into the broader context of end-of-life care. To that end, I also welcome the promise to invest $3 billion over four years in home care.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318771">I believe that, like the bill, this is a step in the right direction, but it is not the final destination. I will vote in favour of this bill at second reading, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same. </ParaText>

							<ParaText id="4318800"> My voting position on second reading will be carefully considered from a balance of available information, including from the consultations I have held with interested stakeholders in my riding. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318801"> To begin, I would like to share some of my personal experiences. During my time as the Minister of State for Seniors, I had the opportunity to work with many groups who are devoted to protecting our most vulnerable and ensuring quality palliative care. The unfortunate reality is that there are many seniors who are not provided with effective end-of-life care. Instead, they are subject to elder abuse and are often pressured into making decisions to avoid becoming a burden to their families. This is tragic. It is absolutely imperative that we ensure that there are safeguards to protect seniors against such elder abuse.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318802">A potential safeguard to protect financial abuse of elders, which is a very common and unfortunate form of elder abuse, is to simply prohibit any independent witnesses from financially profiting at all from the will or the estate of those who requested physician-assisted suicide This was actually a recommendation from a group of constituents I met with recently. They pointed out that in the bill, the independent witnesses that have to sign the documentation to enable the physician-assisted suicide only have to know or believe they are not a beneficiary under the will of the person making such a request. Again, this is simply not enough. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318803">Back in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="214042" Type="2">Richmond Centre</Affiliation>, I have been an active member of the Richmond Rotary Club. This club was instrumental in building the first hospice in Richmond. It was there that I and my fellow Rotarians witnessed first-hand the benefits quality palliative care can bring people. Life is valuable at every stage. One of my primary concerns with physician-assisted suicide is that it will only complicate end-of-life decisions. Individuals who are sick or need additional care will see themselves as a burden, and choose death to avoid placing further expectations on family members.</ParaText>

This is totally and absolutely unacceptable. This issue is quickly becoming more about access to death than access to life. It is absolutely essential that the government make a commitment to strengthen palliative care and encourage citizens to seek such care first. Palliative care provides death with true dignity and not a forced death, which is what physician-assisted suicide is.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318806">Last year, I had the opportunity to meet with organizations such as the Council for Canadians with Disabilities, the CCD. I met with its representatives to discuss their concerns and the importance of protecting individuals with disabilities. More recently, they were able to appear as witnesses at the special joint committee to discuss their views on possible legislation. The CCD was very concerned with the recommendations provided by the committee and commented, “The permissive approach would put vulnerable people at risk”.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318807">We cannot ignore the needs of our most vulnerable. It is crucial that the legislation reflect the concerns of groups such as the Council for Canadians with Disabilities to ensure all Canadians are protected.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318808">I would like to share a few of the comments I have heard from my constituents over the past several months. I will emphasize that my repeating these comments in the House today does not mean that I endorse all of them, but rather, this is a reflection of the variety of comments received. I know as an elected figure this may be hazardous as I may be quoted out of context; however, it is my duty to ensure that these voices are heard.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318809">A primary theme as a result of my consultations is that Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> would only decriminalize the act of physician-assisted suicide as performed by medical practitioners.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318810">I will add that there would be no effects or changes to the Canada Health Act, nor would it instruct our provinces to provide this procedure as something to be covered under provincial medical insurance plans. In my home province of British Columbia, this is the medical services plan, the MSP.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318811">In general, there seemed to be a considerable amount of confusion about whether the provincial governments would actually provide this procedure and whether they would indeed pay for it.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318812">One stakeholder group mentioned it wished to invoke the notwithstanding clause to maintain the previous provisions of the Criminal Code. This group found the terminology of what constituted a terminal illness to be a slippery slope and that unendurable pain could be mitigated with quality palliative care. As it realized that this was generally not a realistic approach with the existing government, it also mentioned that it was hoping for a robust protection for health care providers and facilities to act according to their conscience.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318813">There were many other comments, but I have only 10 minutes for this speech, so I will state again that I have been pleased with the amount of interest we have received from engaged citizens and stakeholder groups on Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. I will be making my voting decision after giving the people of <Affiliation DbId="214042" Type="2">Richmond Centre</Affiliation> the maximum period of time to send their feedback.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318814"> I would like to end my speech with a short story.

As parliamentarians, we must consider a diverse range of views on this complex issue. I know that we all take this responsibility very seriously.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318834">The starting point is, of course, the February 6, 2015 decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Carter v. Canada. The court unanimously held that the criminal laws prohibiting physician-assisted dying interfere with liberty and security of the person by denying grievously and irremediably ill individuals the ability to make decisions concerning their bodily integrity and medical care, and leaving them to endure intolerable suffering.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318835">The court also held that the laws deprive some people of life by forcing them to end their lives prematurely for fear that they would be incapable of doing so when they reached a point where their suffering was intolerable. The court accepted that the criminal prohibition on assistance in dying furthers a pressing and substantial legislative objective, that of preventing vulnerable individuals from being induced to die by suicide against their will in a moment of weakness. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318836">However, the court concluded that a permissive regime with properly designed and administered safeguards was capable of protecting vulnerable people from abuse and error, and that the absolute prohibition went farther than necessary to achieve its objective. The court appropriately left the task of designing this new regime to Parliament. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318837">The proposed legislation responds to the Carter ruling by enacting a new legal framework for access to medical assistance in dying, including the safeguards that the court called for in order to minimize the potential for errors and abuse.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318838"> The court did not define the term "grievously and irremediably ill", but the proposed legislation does define it in a manner that is consistent with these circumstances. Specifically, the person must be in an advanced state of irreversible decline in capability. The person must have a serious and incurable medical condition. The person must be suffering intolerably. The person's death must have become reasonably foreseeable, taking into account all of the person's unique medical circumstances.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318839">Canadians would have the comfort of knowing that they would be able to get the assistance they need if they are suffering intolerably when their capacity declines as they approach the end of their lives.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318840"> Like so many honourable members who have stood in this house to debate this difficult legislation, I have my own personal story that makes this issue all the more relevant. My mother, Eleanor Anderson, spent over 10 years in a wheelchair after suffering a massive stroke at the age of 69. She had to learn to walk, talk, eat, everything right from scratch. Then it happened again, another stroke five years later. She fought back again, but with each stroke a little more of her was taken away.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318841"> She never wanted to feel helpless. During those years in a wheelchair, my mother would try her best to do everything on her own, whether it was dressing, loading the dishwasher, or simply wiping down the kitchen counter. During those years, she never wanted our sympathy.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318842">Despite her tenacity, she knew the day would come when she could not fight any longer. She made it very clear to my father, to me, and my brother that if the time came and she was not able to do much more than lie in a bed, she wanted to drift away peacefully. As expected, what we all feared eventually happened.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318843">She continued to have small strokes, losing mobility and function with each one, to the point that she could no longer sit up in her wheelchair, talk, or even eat. We were not even sure if she knew any of us anymore. She pulled out the feeding tube that kept her alive, to the point where the doctors said they wanted to insert a tube in her stomach. That was not the life my mother wanted, and so we said no. We had to let her go. Doctors agreed it was best, and said she would only last a few days. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318844">We asked that she be moved to palliative care at another hospital. Ironically, they said they could not move her because she would not make it, that she would die en route, and so she lay in that hospital bed, and we watched her slowly starve to death.</ParaText>

I still work at the hospital a few times a month, mainly in emergency and intensive care. This is important to me. End-of-life care is very important, which is why I supported a motion that my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="214564" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> moved during the previous Parliament. That motion dealt with with a national palliative care strategy.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318871">To begin, I would like to highlight two or three points form the Supreme Court decision that I think are particularly important to this discussion. The decision states:</ParaText><ParaText id="4318872"><LegislationQuote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2"> ...the prohibition [of medical assistance in dying] deprives some individuals of life, as it has the effect of forcing some individuals to take their own lives prematurely, for fear that they would be incapable of doing so when they reached the point where suffering was intolerable. </QuotePara></LegislationQuote></ParaText><ParaText id="4318873"><LegislationQuote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">And by leaving them to endure intolerable suffering, it impinges on their security of the person. </QuotePara></LegislationQuote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318874">It is important to mention that the Supreme Court decision underscores the government's responsibility to address the suffering that people experience. It is also important to understand the difference between suffering and pain. Pain is a physiological reaction to stress, such as an injury. Suffering has to do with an emotional experience.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318875">Take, for example, a very painful event such as childbirth. That pain is associated with a positive emotional experience, the birth of a child. That event does not necessarily cause suffering, but it does cause significant pain.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318876">A person might also have a minor injury that can cause extreme suffering because of the emotional experience associated with it. I think it is important to make that distinction.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318877">These days, we have excellent therapeutic ways to alleviate pain. Opiates were long used, but now we also have patient-controlled analgesic pumps. We can even offer continuous palliative sedation, similar to what intensive care patients receive when they are intubated to ensure that they do not feel any pain. There are a number of extremely effective ways of alleviating pain, in addition to non-pharmacological methods. We have a good range of treatments to offer patients who are in pain.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318878">It is possible to alleviate the suffering that comes with an emotional experience such as the end of life or an end-of-life diagnosis without resorting to medical assistance in dying. In that case, palliative care is an option. The bill applies to adults with a serious and incurable illness, disease, or disability who are in an advanced state of irreversible decline in capability and whose natural death has become reasonably foreseeable. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318879">Obviously, we are talking here about people who are at the end of their lives, people who need palliative care. The purpose of palliative care is to ease the suffering of both the patient and the family. Palliative care helps ensure that people are cared for properly, and that they have the help they need to get through the grieving process and the hardship associated with illness.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4318880">We want to take away all the pain, but we also want to provide support for the family.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318881">Optimal palliative care helps not only the patient but also the whole family, so that the patient's death can be as peaceful as possible for everyone involved. We are going about things the wrong way by providing medical assistance in dying when the palliative care offered in Canada is not yet optimal. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318882">When palliative care facilities are underfunded and need to try to drum up donations every year, they are unable to offer optimal palliative care. Most of these facilities can only take patients who are expected to die in less than three months. However, people can often live much longer than that with a terminal illness and they need a lot more support.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318883">Moreover, in many rural areas, palliative care beds are reserved through surgical units. That means that nurses who are taking care of palliative care patients also have to take care of seven or eight other patients. Nurses are therefore unable to respond quickly or spend as much time as they should with the families, and the patient's death does not go the way he or she would like.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318884">For people who do not have the means or who do not want to die at home, unfortunately the hospital is often the only other option when palliative care beds are not available. This is not an easy experience, and it can create suffering because patients do not always have all the support they deserve.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318885">There has been a lot of effort in recent years to remove some natural processes from hospitals. One example would be the birthing centres that have been set up. The thinking is that it would be better for mothers to go through pregnancy and childbirth a little more naturally in a setting other than a hospital, as long as there are no medical complications.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318886">The same thing is being done with death, which is a natural process. It is being taken out of hospitals to make the experience much more positive, in a place other than the medical setting of a hospital.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318887">Hospices try to remove all traces of hospitals. They have hospital beds, but they try to use the patients' own bedding, have large windows, and help patients forget that they are not at home.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318888">Unfortunately, no matter how hard the palliative care facilities work, they are often underfunded. For example, the Maison du bouleau blanc, in my riding, has four beds, only two of which are subsidized. It therefore relies on donations to maintain its other two beds. It has a large room with big windows and a shower, but this is the only room that the facility has been able to convert to an ideal palliative care room. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318889">These people cannot afford nurses. The people who work there are extremely dedicated practical nurses. However, they have some legal limits. For that reason, all the protocols regarding doctors working with palliative care facilities had to be updated, in order to ensure proper care for the patients.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318890">We could address a number of shortcomings and avoid making the patients suffer. If someone who receives a terminal diagnosis knows that they will receive good palliative care as their condition worsens, they may not choose to take their own life prematurely. This would therefore help protect the right to life.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318891">However, as long as do nothing on palliative care, we are working backwards. We cannot reverse the life-based medical model to allow for medical assistance in dying if our palliative care services are not as good as possible or accessible to all Canadians, regardless of where they live, even if they live in a remote region.</ParaText>

A patient who refuses this treatment will die in the short term, but continuing to receive the treatment will not cause death.

					<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Zimmer" id="8890157"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="214450" Type="2">Mr. Bob Zimmer (Prince George—Peace River—Northern Rockies, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4318905">Mr. Speaker, indeed this is a heavy subject for most Canadians. Physician-assisted suicide is definitely weighty. There were laws that we thought were sufficient, but it is as a result of the Supreme Court deciding the law is not sufficient that we are in this predicament today of having to find some alternatives.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318906">I will be speaking to some different issues. I would not say they are of the highest importance to me. I will speak about those issues a little later. However, I want to talk about a few of the issues that are not talked about as much. One of them is on page 11 of the bill, called “Deeming”. I will read from the act itself. It states:</ParaText><ParaText id="4318907"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">For the purposes of this Act, if a member of the forces receives medical assistance in dying, that member is deemed to have died as a result of the illness, disease or disability for which they were determined to be entitled to receive that assistance</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4318908">I will go to the next page, where it again says “Deeming”. This time it states:</ParaText><ParaText id="4318909"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">For the purposes of this Act, if a member or a veteran receives medical assistance in dying, that member or veteran is deemed to have died as a result of the illness, disease or disability for which they were determined to be entitled to receive that assistance</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318910">I mention that today as a former member of the veterans affairs committee, which dealt with PTSD, with veterans who have experienced trauma as a result of war, as well as relatives who have suffered trauma and PTSD as a result of war. I am concerned about this clause in a dramatic way, due to the potential for it to be used as a way out for families. It could be a means of financial assurance, if the member decides it is a way out, that could provide sustenance for his or her family. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318911">I feel it would open a door that was previously closed to members. We certainly respect the ones who have passed as a result of suicide, but I am concerned that this opens the door wider, to making it a somewhat legitimate exercise and to potentially doing it for families to receive benefit. We should be looking at more ways to help members of the forces and veterans with PTSD rather than giving them a doorway out.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318912">The second issue I would say is a more significant argument for me, and that is the issue of compelling. Compelling has different forms. Compelling, as we heard from physicians who are friends of mine, and nurses, could be a doctor compelling a nurse to deliver a life-ending drug. Can a patient compel a doctor to end that patient's life? Does a senior feel compelled to end his or her life to lessen the financial burden to the family? Does a senior feel compelled to end his or her life to make room for others in hospital rooms and beds in our country?</ParaText><ParaText id="4318913">I feel that there are a lot of arguments. I will first talk about the argument of a physician compelling a nurse. Certainly there is discussion within the bill to allow physicians to have the freedom to do what they wish to do based on their religious beliefs, or the basic belief that life is sacred and not wanting to take part in assisted dying. Most of us fully understand the way that the Supreme Court can be used as a tool. A citizen could use the Supreme Court as a tool if a doctor refused service. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318914">If a doctor refused to assist a person to end his or her life, it would likely end up in a court, which I am sure will happen if this bill passes the way that it is. Doctors could be held to account, if a law is enacted that they have a responsibility to perform that duty for Canadian citizens. Likewise, if doctors feel compelled to perform that service, which is what we heard in testimony from doctors directly, doctors do not actually give the injection or do the duty of ending the life. It is passed on to another member of the medical staff, usually a nurse, and that person will be compelled by a doctor's order to deliver the life-ending treatment or drug. Those are huge issues, and any one of those breaks in the chain could potentially end up in a court. A particular member of medical staff would be ordered to enforce that care.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4318915">I will move on to the more general compelling of seniors and people who are ill in our society. I have two senior parents. May dad is 82 and my mom is 72. The last thing I would want would be for them to feel like they are a burden on our system. They have contributed all their lives. To this day, my dad still works as a carpenter out in the shop. He pays his taxes. A senior should not feel like he or she needs to end his or her life based on a health care system that needs more space or is just too expensive. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318916">I love my parents, but that is not always the case across Canada. Different families do not agree as much as I do with my parents and there are frictions within families. Would some of these frictions within families be used to compel seniors to possibly end their lives because they have been made to feel they are a burden on our system? Certainly these are the what-if cases, but with 30 million people, these cases will arise, if they have not arisen already. It is deeply concerning to me that this is even an option. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318917">Much has been said of late about the suicides in Attawapiskat and suicide in general and what the feelings are about suicide. I do not think we can sugar coat it. We call it end of life and some other groups have call it different names, but it is suicide. It is the ending of someone's life. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318918">What concerns me is an example of what could potentially happen. A group of individuals who feel they do not want to be on Earth anymore go into a physician's office and based on a psychiatrist's exam and review, they are warranted to end their lives. I am concerned this opens the door wide to an acceptance of suicide as a somewhat acceptable form of living in this world or ending one's life in this world. It is a huge concern for me.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318919">Lastly, I will speak about why I do not think we need to be in this situation. It goes back to the notwithstanding clause. I had a conversation with a judge on a plane ride home to Vancouver. My comment to the judge was that as members of Parliament we were checked every four years during an election. Often we would see many different faces in this place. The people of Canada have checked us. Some have made it back and some have not. We see some new faces. They made it here because the people spoke. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318920">What check is on the judiciary of our country? The response from this Supreme Court justice was that there was a check, the notwithstanding clause.</ParaText><ParaText id="4318921"> I know it is yeoman's work to even try to get this kind of law into some kind of acceptable form because of so many diversities, but we already have a law. It is the job of 338 members of the House of Commons to enact laws. It is the job of the Supreme Court to uphold those laws. My concern is that there seems to be a usurping of our particular body by the Supreme Court. I would challenge the government to look into that. It should look into whether we already have a law. A lot of us still accept the law for what it is. Rather than having a discussion about reforming and rewriting what is already there, we need to go back and really think seriously about it. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318922">I certainly agree with most people here that palliative care needs to be better in Canada. We have all had passionate arguments about the sanctity of life. I believe all were created equal in this place. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318923">However, we need to seriously think about either rewriting the law as it was, as Canadians have sent us here to do, or upholding the laws that are already in place by previous bodies of elected people to the House. We need to honour this place. This is the place where we make laws. It is not just we 338 individuals. We have been sent here to represent over 30 million people, and their voices need to be heard loud and clear. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318924">It is a tough argument to have in this place. There are many issues on both sides that we all feel very passionate about, in whatever form that is, but we need to consider seriously upholding the laws currently in place. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The physician, under Quebec law, must also ensure the continuation of consent with interviews with the patient held at different times, spaced by a reasonable time having regard to the patient's condition. I would say that these are appropriate safeguards in the Quebec law. I would like to see similar safeguards in the Canadian law. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318971">Another concern to us is in relation to the rights of conscience of physicians and health institutions.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4318972">We are very concerned about the conscience rights of medical personnel.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4318973">As mentioned in the dissenting report, section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees all Canadians freedom of conscience and religion. The dissenting report clearly states that there was near unanimous agreement among the witnesses that physicians who objected to taking part in physician-assisted dying for reasons of conscience should not be forced to do so. Although not obliged directly by this legislation to provide PAD, physician-assisted dying, the obligation to refer patients through an effective referral infringes on the spirit, and I would say the letter, of section 2 of the charter. I therefore believe that such a regime is unnecessary and note that Canada would be the first jurisdiction in the world to require an effective referral regime. </ParaText><ParaText id="4318974">I believe there are better models that would protect the charter rights of physicians and provide access to physician-assisted dying, but under this legislation, physicians who conscientiously object to physician-assisted dying are required to provide information to their patients on how to access PAD and to advise the government of his or her patient's request. I believe this is unfair to the physician and this legislation does not sufficiently protect physicians' rights. I also believe that health care institutions that object to offering physician-assisted dying and related services should be exempted in accordance with the Supreme Court's determination that individual collective aspects of freedom of religion and conscience guaranteed under the charter are indissolubly intertwined.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318975">In my home province of Ontario, the current policy of the College of Physicians and Surgeons is that it is a requirement not only to refer, but also to provide services that are within the standard of care of an emergency situation. Therefore, passing this legislation without conscience protection would mean that PAD would enter the standard of care and would fit within the existing policy framework of the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Ontario. It means that in my jurisdiction, there would be an effective right to force the physician to be part of this process even when she or he does not want to be part of the process. This is a major and grave concern to me and to physicians in my constituency as well.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4318976">The other issue that should concern us is whether this legislation respects the Carter decision and would it survive a charter challenge. I would say there is sufficient and grave cause to understand that this may not be the case.

I will explain why I believe the bill deserves support, but by the same token, I believe that somehow in a future Parliament the bill could go further. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319266">I intend to engage in this discussion by going through three thematic components in the brief 10 minutes I have to make my contribution to this important debate. I know this has been at times an emotional issue for parliamentarians, but in the three thematic components, I wish to give my rationale for my support at this time. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319267">The first of the three themes looks at the moral considerations that many members and much of the broader public have expressed. Second, I want to discuss perhaps more fulsomely our duty as parliamentarians to respond to issues of constitutionality, particularly when they are challenged in the courts. Third, in the short remaining time I will have, I wish to express some personal thoughts on this as it impacts me directly. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319268">First, I want to thank many constituents in my riding of Scarborough—Agincourt for their interventions on this subject. This has been an emotional matter, and I would have to state on the record that the overwhelming majority of constituents who reached out to me are opposed to the government introducing Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. That has been primarily on moral grounds. They feel that allowing physician-assisted death is essentially tantamount to murder. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319269">In the opportunities I have had to discuss this matter with my constituents, I made it clear that Parliament is under a positive obligation to respond to the decision in the Carter case. If Parliament does not present some form of legislation, the consequence of its failure to do so would mean that the provisions of section 14 and subsection 241(b) of the Criminal Code would no longer be operative as of June 6. We would essentially be left in the situation of a legislative vacuum. It is important to put a regulatory framework around physician-assisted death.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319270">As I pivot from the issue of morality to the issue of our responsibility as parliamentarians, I want to raise the point that while morality is important, and this has been a theme discussed in the House, ultimately we as parliamentarians must first make sure that we put in laws that pass the constitutional test. Where the Supreme Court of Canada has rendered a decision indicating that something is not constitutional, that it is a breach of some form of the constitution, whether on jurisdictional grounds or on grounds under the charter, Parliament needs to respond. In my view, that is what the government is doing in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, under a very difficult timeline. That is perhaps why there has been a decision to introduce Bill C-14 in a relatively controlled and restrictive manner. It is reflective of the fact that we are under a very tight time obligation. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319271">Therefore, I understand why the <Affiliation DbId="214903" Type="96">Minister of Justice</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="214328" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> and others, who have done yeoman's work in this regard, have taken initial steps to make sure it meets the constitutional test set out by the Supreme Court of Canada. However, in my view, it does not necessarily go far enough. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319272">I want to pay tribute to the ministers and to all the other many parties and Canadians who have contributed to the debate. I note that there was incredible work done by the Special Joint Committee on Physician-Assisted Dying, led by Senator Ogilvie and the member for <Affiliation DbId="214013" Type="2">Don Valley West</Affiliation>. I want to pay tribute to all the members who participated in that committee. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="20">(1520)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4319273"> I want to note the contributions of the federal external panel, the provincial-territorial expert panel, and the many stakeholders and Canadians who have contributed to this very difficult debate.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319274">I would note, though, that not only have many of my constituents expressed concerns with respect to this particular bill, but in some specific instances they have asked us to consider invoking the section 33 notwithstanding clause found in the charter, which of course is the legislative override provision. I would view that as a more sophisticated way of saying they oppose it and that ultimately parliamentarians should please consider overriding the charter rights of certain individuals by invoking or using the notwithstanding clause.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319275"> I would say to those individuals who have expressed that particular feeling that this is something we have to do and tread upon very carefully, particularly where we are potentially treading on rights that have been protected under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. I would submit respectfully that it is important we do so in a manner that follows the tests that are similarly found in section 1 that were ultimately articulated in the Oakes decision that deals with the judicial override clause that is found in the charter. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319276">Under Oakes, there are essentially three tests that need to be met, and if any one of those tests fails, namely in dealing with the judicial override, then one would not be able to invoke section 1, and I would argue that one would have to use the same principles under section 33 in exercising the legislative override. Those three tests basically deal with rational connection, that the impairment is done in as minimal a way as possible, and that we look at the deleterious effects and salutary benefits of any limitation that is imposed under section 1.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319277">Typically, in application of section 1 of the charter in most instances, the failure falls under the second test, that the impairment is not as minimal as possible. Certainly, that was the basis in which the section 1 test was applied in Carter and which the court found that the proposed absolute ban on physician-assisted death did not meet the minimal impairment test. The court had carefully gone through the trial judge's analysis and concurred with the trial judge's position with respect to the application of section 1.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319278">In terms of whether we would consider invoking section 33, as I mentioned already, this Parliament, this House of Commons, has never exercised section 33 as a legislative override, and I would argue that we too should be extremely careful. That is the test that we need to apply as parliamentarians in terms of determining whether we feel it is appropriate to use the legislative override.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319279">As I mentioned before, the bill seeks to meet in a very expedited fashion a court-imposed time challenge and to deal with the suspension of the declaration of invalidity under sections 14 and 241 of the Criminal Code of Canada. We must do so by June 6.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319280">As I have indicated before, I will be providing my support for the bill, but I would argue that there are a couple of additional things that we as a Parliament need to consider in the future. These were articulated quite clearly in the report from the special joint committee of the Senate and the House of Commons.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319281">My first issue is that the bill currently does not deal with the issue of advance directives. I am sympathetic to those Canadians, particularly those who are suffering from diseases like ALS and others, who may still be in quite good shape at the present time, but at some future point, when they are getting close to their end-of-life situation, will not be able to express their particular consent. In my view, the issue of a clearly articulated regulatory framework that allows for advance consent should be considered.</ParaText>

He mentioned individuals who suffer from ALS.

Since the Supreme Court ruled in the Carter case last year, Canadians have been taking part in this national debate. This issue continues to be debated and seriously considered around the world.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319302">I would like to share with my colleagues what is happening elsewhere in the world. Almost everywhere, the deliberate taking of a life or aiding someone to end their life are serious crimes punished by lengthy sentences. As many people know, Canada is not alone in legislating to authorize medical assistance in dying.<Document DbId="8177165" Type="3"/></ParaText><ParaText id="4319303">Oregon, Washington, Vermont, and California are examples nearby. A little further away, Colombia, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg have legislation authorizing one type or another of medical assistance in dying. The provisions on safeguards, controls, and reports, which are all found in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, are similar.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319304">Usually, requests for medical assistance in dying must be voluntarily submitted by the patient in writing. In many cases, this must also be done in the presence of independent witnesses. The patient must obtain a second opinion from an independent doctor and must wait a certain amount of time between the day the written request is submitted and the day that the medical assistance in dying is provided.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319305">Colombia has a unique approval process for requests for medical assistance in dying. Every hospital has interdisciplinary committees to assess such requests and support the patients and their families throughout the process. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319306">Nearly all of the regimes we have looked at include a mandatory monitoring system in which independent committees collect information to monitor the situation. That information is then used to publish periodic public reports on medical assistance in dying.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319307">The safeguards and controls set out in various statutes are relatively consistent. However, there are differences in the types of medical assistance in dying that are authorized and the circumstances in which medical assistance in dying is authorized. The differences in terms of who is eligible for medical assistance in dying and the way that assistance can be provided fall along a continuum.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319308">On the one hand, we have the four U.S. states, which I mentioned earlier and which have enacted laws: Oregon in 1997, Washington in 2008, Vermont in 2013, and, more recently, California in 2015. In these states, a mentally competent adult 18 years of age or older can receive the assistance of a physician to die, provided that their request is voluntary and this person is suffering from a terminal disease, defined as an incurable and irreversible disease that has been medically confirmed and will, within reasonable medical judgment, produce death within six months. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319309">In these U.S. states, just one doctor may prescribe a substance that the patient administers to put an end to their life at the time of their choosing. This is what we commonly refer to as physician-assisted suicide. Voluntary euthanasia, in which the physician administers a substance that causes the death of the patient, is expressly prohibited. Patients are also not able to submit an advance directive.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319310">In Colombia, a ministerial resolution was drafted in response to two rulings by the country's constitutional court. The resolution contains eligibility criteria similar to those of the U.S. states.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="35">(1535)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4319311"> It limits eligibility to adults who have an incurable disease, which is defined as a serious, progressive, and irreversible disease, or a pathology that will lead to death within a relatively short time frame. It requires a specific prognosis of six months, in other words, the assurance that death is expected relatively soon. Unlike the U.S. states, Colombia authorizes only euthanasia. A doctor must administer the substance that will cause the patient's death.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319312">At the other end of the spectrum are Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. In those three countries, patients can access medical assistance in dying if they are experiencing intolerable or unbearable physical or mental suffering caused by a serious incurable illness and if there is no possibility of improvement. Patients do not have to be dying or suffering from an illness that puts their life in danger in order to be eligible. In other words, physician-assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia are authorized in those countries.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319313">Although medical assistance in dying is provided only to adults in Luxembourg, minors as young as 12 can seek medical assistance in dying, with their parents' consent, in the Netherlands. In Belgium, adults and emancipated minors can seek medical assistance in dying in similar circumstances. In 2014, Belgium expanded its eligibility to include children of all ages, but only if their death is likely to occur in the short term and their suffering is physical.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319314">The experiences and lessons learned by the Benelux countries were closely examined. For example, the law in the Netherlands authorizes requests for patients who no longer have the ability to express their wishes. However, research suggests that doctors are generally not prepared to euthanize such patients.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319315">Consideration was also given to the Benelux countries' experience regarding patients who are suffering intolerably solely because of a mental illness. This is a very controversial issue. Evidence shows an upward trend in the percentage of people who seek euthanasia solely because of mental illness, and experts are starting to express their concerns about the fact that medical assistance in dying under such circumstances is becoming increasingly common. For example, in Belgium, people have been euthanized because of intolerable suffering resulting from depression, anorexia, blindness, fear of a disability or further suffering, and the pain caused by the lost of a loved one.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319316">Many people fear that such broad access to medical assistance in dying can present real risks for people who are lonely or isolated and those who do not have any social, economic, or community support. It could also reinforce prejudice regarding the quality of life of seniors, people who are sick, and people with disabilities.</ParaText>

There is no clear demarcation between physician-assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia. Part of that, I think, is because we like the softer language of the current bill, but the more important distinction is that in a regime that has physician-assisted suicide, the results are that only 0.3% of all deaths are attributed to physician-assisted suicide. In regimes that have voluntary euthanasia, it is 3.0%, a tenfold increase in the number of deaths resulting from a system with voluntary euthanasia.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319321">I am wondering if my colleague would agree to include an amendment in the final bill that would say that wherever possible, where the patient is able to, it must be physician-assisted suicide, so that the patients themselves must administer the drug that the doctor prescribes.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Today, this discussion is essential in order to address the concerns many Canadians have about quality of life.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319336">Our society is constantly evolving, and for obvious and sometimes valid reasons, our democratic institutions will always be partly out of step with popular sentiment. However, the wishes of the majority should not be the only factor that guides us in our decision-making, because if our democratic institutions do not protect minorities, I wonder who will.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319337">There are some historic issues that stand out in the life of a parliament, and as a result of the Carter ruling, we are now being called on to deal with such an issue. Although we are aware that there is little time left to deal with such a vast and also complex issue, we nevertheless have the good fortune of being able to refer to the Quebec experience, which quite surely can be a source of inspiration and can answer many of our questions.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319338">Today, armed with the Quebec experience, our personal experiences, and input from many organizations and people in our respective ridings, we are being called on to make the best possible decision about how to provide medical assistance in dying. This is not about whether or not this assistance should be available.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319339">The Supreme Court made that decision in Carter. As we all know, it was a unanimous ruling that sent a clear message on behalf of those who have spent years fighting for the right to die with dignity. It is up to us to legislate a framework for that assistance in a way that ensures respect for everyone's charter rights.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319340">The bill is far from perfect, but at this point, I plan to vote in favour of it so that we can have the opportunity to perfect it by suggesting useful amendments during the committee's study.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319341">I would like to share a very personal experience because I think that is the best entry point with this issue. Until recently, I was spared any major health problems, but not long ago, when I had a kidney stone that was relatively benign and easily treated, I had to cope with waiting six hours to get a drug that would alleviate my suffering.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319342">When I shared my story with a few people I know, several of whom had had similar experiences, I saw how quickly people responded to suffering with sincere compassion.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319343">Although this was a relatively minor health problem, for the first time, I felt, in my own body, the pain that may have been felt by my own parents, who both died of cancer. I spent as much time as possible with them when they had to move into a hospice. There is no doubt that their suffering was enduring and intolerable and that their health problems were grievous and irremediable. They met all of the criteria set out by the Supreme Court.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319344">The workers in that hospice understood and still understand that no one should have to suffer while they are waiting to die when there are ways to relieve their pain, even though, in many cases, one of the side effects of the drugs is to precipitate death.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="50">(1550)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4319345">I have to say that when I remember the relief that I saw on my mother's and father's faces, I am inclined to support this bill and try to improve it. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319346">This bill should be accompanied by a real national strategy on palliative care. In my opinion, some or all of the $3 billion that the Liberals promised for home care during the election campaign should have been included in the most recent budget. However, that is not the case.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319347">Cancer can strike at any age and often there is no hope of recovery. Many other diseases produce similar effects of enduring and intolerable suffering without necessarily being life-threatening. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319348">That is why I am also concerned about the fact that in this bill, the government did not use the wording in the conditions set out in the Supreme Court's decision. The Supreme Court basically said that Canadian adults who are able to consent and who have a grievous and irremediable medical condition that causes enduring suffering that is intolerable to them have the charter-protected right to physician-assisted death. That is the crux of the Carter decision, which gave rise to the bill that is before us today, Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319349">What is the government trying to do today with this fourth criterion that it added, whereby the natural death has to be reasonably foreseeable? I have to admit to the House that in my mind at least, this is confusing. The terms are hard to define, the likely commendable goal being to seek the broadest consensus, even though that consensus already exists. If not, we would not be debating this bill. The Supreme Court likely would not have ruled the same way either if it had not sensed the evolution of this society.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319350">We are about to undermine the process with such a vague and mandatory criterion because the legislation tells us that to have access to medical assistance in dying, the person absolutely must meet the four criteria set out in the legislation. The first three criteria are easy to understand, but the fourth is exceptionally vague. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319351">I hope to see this fourth criterion disappear during our discussions in committee. With it, we are about to force those who are suffering to again demonstrate the unconstitutionality of the legislation, leading us right back to where we are today. We are here now, so let us see the work through and do it properly. Let us agree to ensure that this bill complies with the Constitution, that it will not be challenged later, and that those who wish to use it can finally do so.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319352">Other questions remain practically unanswered, which is why the work coming up in committee after the bill passes second reading, I hope, is so important. As we point out in our supplementary opinion attached to the report, the government must adopt an approach to legislating medical assistance in dying based on the following principles: protecting vulnerable persons; taking into account the ethical concerns of all medical professionals; guaranteeing equal access to medical assistance in dying; protecting the conscientious objection of health care professionals; and respecting jurisdictions.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319353">My time is running out, so I will conclude by saying that the NDP's job is to clarify the ambiguous provisions in the bill, strengthen the bill to avoid charter challenges, and demand stronger commitments with respect to palliative care and mental health care services to protect the most vulnerable Canadians. I can sense this in listening to my colleagues and all members of this House.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319354">I am prepared to take questions from my esteemed colleagues.</ParaText>

The question is deeply personal, emotional, and even spiritual, and I understand and appreciate the concerns and challenges many have with the subject matter before us.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319368">I, too, have struggled with these decisions, as have others. For example, I was deeply concerned when I was first confronted with the report of the Special Joint Committee on Physician-Assisted Dying. In particular, one of the areas I was concerned about was the idea that minors might be able to attain medical assistance in dying. I was also concerned with the notion that doctors who, for legitimate issues of faith or conscience, oppose medical assistance in dying might be forced to participate in this process contrary to their personal beliefs. Both of these things would have made the bill clearly unacceptable to me. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319369">Fortunately, Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> attempts to address these issues by seeking to find a balance in this legislation, the best approach to ensure that dying patients who are suffering unbearable pain have the choice of a peaceful death and that the vulnerable are protected. I still question whether we have done the very best job we could do. I know the committee worked very hard at this and spent many hours listening to people. I guess I am still looking to see if we can make it better. However, I have to acknowledge the extremely tight timelines we are under, and the House must contend with those deadlines or we will have no protection for anyone. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319370">The Supreme Court decision and the parliamentary timelines over the past year have combined to thrust us into this time crunch that none of us would have preferred to be in. This does not change the fact that we are here now. Nor does it change the fact that the defeat of Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> would mean the current prohibition on medical assistance in dying would end. The fact is that the Supreme Court unanimously decided that Canadians suffering intolerably have the right to request assistance to end their suffering.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319371">The issue before us is not if, but how, we do this. This is not a political issue for me, and I do not believe it is a political issue for anyone in the House.

							<ParaText id="4319372">Palliative care, parental leave, family leave, and home care, while not directly contained in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, must be part of the discussion, and they are. As I listen to the debate, it is clear that the matter is one that members are contemplating in a holistic way. I am pleased to hear again as part of the debate on this legislation that the government is committed to supporting quality end-of-life services and will continue to work with provinces and territories to improve palliative care for everyone. That means we will engage with the provinces and territories to support the development of a pan-Canadian monitoring system to collect and analyze data, monitor trends, and publicly report on medical assistance in dying. This helps to assure us that the government's approach is one of caution, one that is seeking a balance.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319373">I also need to acknowledge the parliamentary secretary's verification that the government will work with the provinces and territories to explore mechanisms to coordinate end-of-life care for patients who want access to medical assistance in dying, while respecting the personal convictions of health care providers.</ParaText>

This means that the issue before us again is not if but how.

							<ParaText id="4319378">For me, this is not just a discussion about the extension of life, nor should it be exclusively a decision about prolonging one's death. In instances where the end of life is near, the court has spoken and Parliament must now step up. If we fail to take action, we know the consequences, so doing nothing is not appropriate.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319379">In order for me to support Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, I need to be assured of the government's firm and unwavering understanding that it will continue to support quality end-of-life services and will work with provinces and territories to improve palliative care.

No, not a mention.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319400">We should be providing funding to improve and provide palliative care to our aging population in our cities and rural communities. The previous Conservative government started the consultation. After the Carter decision, many submissions were made by Canadians. It is a difficult issue in households across Canada for families who face this and confront the issue. It is a very controversial and highly emotional issue.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319401">Many Canadians believe that the Supreme Court's decision in the Carter v. Canada case is another instance of judicial activism. That was stated in many of the letters received by my constituency office. The court struck down the criminal laws against physician-assisted dying. Many Canadians supported the laws against doctor-assisted suicide. There was a very small group asking for this, the smallest of minorities, but the Supreme Court gave these special interest groups what they wanted.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319402">I believe the Liberal government has shirked its responsibility to educate Canadians on what we are debating. There has not been enough consultations with individuals, groups, and experts. Even today, in the midst of this debate, which has been a good debate, the Liberals tried to shut down the debate. The Liberals have not taken into account a range of interests in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, such as those advocating religious freedom. The previous speaker talked about the conscience rights of physicians and health providers and many are advocating for safeguards to protect the vulnerable. This bill is not a compassionate approach that considers all pertinent interests.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319403">I do not believe the Special Joint Committee on Physician-Assisted Dying did a sufficient study. Quebec studied this issue for six years. Other countries studied it for years. However, the court has given Canada only a matter of weeks of study. The committee did not study what happened in other jurisdictions where we have seen this brought forward. The special joint committee heard from pro-euthanasia lobby groups.

The Liberals say that the committee can make amendments and better define things like conscience rights, or what happens when a doctor refuses to assist a person to commit suicide. The committee may look at the term “reasonable foreseeable death” or the issue of advance consent. However, I have no faith in the Liberal-dominated committee that will hear Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319407">Today the Liberals are in a hurry to pass the bill and send it to committee. I have served and chaired many committees, I have seen how witness lists have been tightly controlled. I do not believe the views of average Canadians will be heard at this committee. I do not believe the religious community in Canada will even be given the chance to testify. I think we will see a Liberal-dominated committee that will turn down all amendments that might change the bill. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319408">We already saw that at the previous special joint committee. That is why the official opposition had to table a dissenting report to the conclusions of the committee. We listed the problems that must be addressed.

Many are in absolute fear of dying. It is the great unknown. There is a chance there will be unbearable pain and suffering, many people believe. We do not know. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319410">Palliative care experts tell us that it is possible to find balance in the human body. The human body is very good at shutting itself down, and palliative care is all about assisting each individual in that process compassionately.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319411">My daughter and wife both serve as nurses.

Health services are, as we know, a provincial jurisdiction. The government knows this and it is trying to wash its hands of some of that issue. In fact, the Liberal government knows there are going to be many problems within the bill when we move forward to the next level and try to get unanimity among all the provinces and territories. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319413">The government has already said that it will continue to study the issues of doctor-assisted suicide. Some have said that we will continue to study the issue around mature minors. Will they someday be able to receive assisted suicide, or people with mental illness? The government is going to study that as well as advance requests.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319414">We know we live in a time where there is a slippery slope. Here we are debating Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. Most of us think those are the parameters today, but what will they be tomorrow? If it is a right today for some people to have doctor-assisted suicide, why is it not then a right for someone else? How long do we think it will before the courts take that one on and change what we may very well want to implement here today? I think it is a concern for people on both sides of the House. It is not good enough, so we need to do some of this work before we talk about the many other things.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319415">There are a couple of areas of concern with the bill that need to be addressed at committee. Canadians need to be certain that physician-assisted dying is limited to competent adult persons 18 years of age and older. We need to ensure safeguards for vulnerable persons and confirm their capacity to make decisions about their life or being killed. We need conscience protections for physicians, and this is the big one.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319416">We need conscience protections for physicians, nurses and other medical practitioners who oppose physician-assisted dying. Once Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> is passed into law, without conscience protections, euthanasia and assisted suicide will enter the standard of care. </ParaText>

How will the law protect the vulnerable? Should the law recognize advance medical directives? Should the law impose waiting periods? Should the law enable conscience objections by health providers?

							<ParaText id="4319442">This is a highly personal and emotional topic for all members in this place and frankly all Canadians facing life and death decisions. Members of my own immediate family struggled in their last days. My younger sister suffered a painful extended period prior to her death, even where some palliative care was available. My older sister suffered a lesser quality of existence for far too many years because the only accommodation for younger, chronically ill patients was an extended care facility for seniors.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319443">Our governments must deliver on promises for expanded palliative care for all, and housing for the chronically ill and disabled. This access is surely also a charter right.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319444">I have carefully considered the letters and conversations with my constituents who have expressed a wide range of views and perspectives on the matter of medically assisted dying. What I found discouraging is the lack of full understanding by many I have spoken with, and the misinformation being provided to them about the implications of the Supreme Court decision, and in particular, those who have expressed opposition to the enactment of a law on providing medical assistance to the dying.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319445">I hosted a meeting in my constituency with my colleague, the MP for <Affiliation DbId="214384" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation>, the co-chair of the special joint committee, to provide an opportunity to understand the background to Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, including the ruling by the Supreme Court, the report of the special joint committee and the tabled bill.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319446">I have been deeply impacted in my views by meetings with a constituent suffering deeply with a fast-paced diagnosis of ALS, already unable to speak and desperately hoping to be able to gain assistance in his death when he determines it is the right time for passing.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319447">I have heard from constituents concerned that the bill reduces the rights of Canadians to choose an assisted death, while others expressed concern the bill would increase risks to the disabled. I must share that by far the majority of views expressed to me, including at my public forum, have expressed concern that the bill does not go far enough in upholding the directions by the Supreme Court to uphold the constitutional and charter rights of Canadians.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4319448">How well does Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> address these key needs and concerns? The bill does set forth a basic framework for decriminalizing medically assisted deaths, including right of access. However, instead of following the recommendations of the Special Joint Committee on Physician-Assisted Dying to adopt the clear and precise terms set forth by the Supreme Court to determine access to medically assisted death, this bill would add further onerous, and frankly nonsensical qualifiers. Most notable is the requirement that a person's natural death has become reasonably foreseeable. Surely that is the case for every human being on this earth.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319449">The Carter family, who was the subject of the Supreme Court ruling, has spoken out strongly against these added criteria. Worse, it is the opinion expressed by numerous legal experts that these additional criteria lack legal certainty and would inevitably force already suffering patients to return to the courts or to travel overseas or to kill themselves. None of these options present a compassionate alternative or uphold our constitutional and charter rights.</ParaText>

The proposed law on medically assisted dying is 19 years too late, but at least it will spare others in similar condition. Unfortunately, it doesn't cover those whose death is not imminent but who have medical conditions that are causing them intolerable suffering. That must be rectified before this law is passed.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319452">A second widespread concern expressed to me is the failure of Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> to provide for advance directives. I am aware from my discussions with Alberta officials that this is a matter of grave concern to Albertans, many of whom are erroneously of the belief that their personal directives cover medical intervention. Many of my constituents have asked me to demand that this right be extended. Again, I quote from a constituent's letter:</ParaText><ParaText id="4319453"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">I would like to have the ability to have an advance directive that would stipulate the conditions under which I would want to have my life ended. At the point I would want assisted death, I may not have the mental or physical capacity to restate my wishes. If this bill passes without the proposed amendments, my only option will be to go to the river valley some minus-30 night and freeze to death. This, of course, will create stress on my family, the community, and police as they search for my body.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319454">Others have expressed concern that the law would fail to prohibit hospitals or other institutions from denying access to medically assisted death on the grounds of religious beliefs. While they accept that individual medical practitioners should be extended that right, they strongly believe there should be a duty to refer to another practitioner, and preferably for the delivery of services within the same institution. This would be the compassionate decision, given the dire state of many who would be making this request. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319455">While the Special Joint Committee on Physician-Assisted Dying agreed to a waiting period between the request and delivery of the services, many have expressed concern that Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> would require a 15-day wait period. Much more preferable would be a waiting period as determined by the medical practitioner, based on the circumstances of each case. I can speak from personal experience that to require a suffering sibling to hang on with severe pain for more than two weeks after making the decision to let go is nothing less than cruel and unusual punishment, and surely offends one's charter rights.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319456">The bill will provide protections to practitioners and afford protections for the disabled. What it would fail to do is extend clear rights to Canadians to determine their own fate within reasonable parameters. Equally disappointing is the failure of the current government to include in its budget the promised dollars for palliative care for all Canadians.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319457">I will vote for this bill at second reading to be considered by a committee. However, I implore the government to ensure that our concerns, the concerns expressed by our constituents and by all Canadians, be considered by the committee members who are undertaking simultaneous review, and to give fair and full consideration to any recommended amendments.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

When the slippery slope argument is invoked, it is as though people think that health care providers do not need to be caring and compassionate, first and foremost, in order to be hired. If that is not the case, they should be thanked and let go. I find it strange that so little consideration is given to health care providers.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319472">We have talked a lot about vulnerable individuals. Those are precisely the people the Supreme Court was trying to protect. The Supreme Court indicated that people with degenerative diseases, who have a grievous and irremediable condition, who are experiencing intolerable suffering, should have access to medical assistance in dying, under section 7. It is pretty remarkable to see that all the rights in section 7, namely, the right to life, the right to liberty, and the right to security of the person, are affected by the total prohibition.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319473">The Supreme Court wanted to protect people in an extremely vulnerable situation. When we talk about protecting the vulnerable, who and what are we talking about? It is as though, when someone enters into a continuum of end-of-life care, they are given the choice from the outset between an injection and comfort care. There is a presumption that should not be there.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319474">What the Supreme Court is asking the legislator to do is to provide a framework for assisted suicide, in other words, for all those whose natural death is not reasonably foreseeable. Those people do not need palliative care. What they need is legislation that frames the provisions to allow them to die with dignity, according to their wishes, and on their terms. That is the essence of the debate. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319475">Yesterday in committee, the Barreau du Québec told us that Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> was not in line with the Carter decision. Last week, the Carter family's lawyer told us that Ms. Carter would not have been entitled to medical assistance in dying. How can the government claim that she would have been entitled? That was the response in committee by the <Affiliation DbId="214328" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="214321" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation>. Did they get an outside opinion?</ParaText><ParaText id="4319476">The Barreau du Québec just said that this bill, because of the totally vague criterion of “reasonably foreseeable natural death”, will make this legislation a legal hornets' nest. I hope that after all this energy we are putting into this debate we will not end up with endless court challenges. The Barreau du Québec sounded the alarm yesterday, as did the Carter family's lawyer. The bill is telling people who have a degenerative disease and are suffering immensely that they cannot make an advance directive. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4319477">People with degenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, ALS, and other cognitive diseases, are not suicidal. They want to live as long as possible until their condition becomes intolerable to them. It is not up to us or anyone else to decide what is or is not tolerable suffering for a person. How could we presume to do so?</ParaText><ParaText id="4319478">We have to protect these people from extreme suffering and a society that is basically trying to make decisions for them.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319479">If Kay Carter did not have access to medical assistance in dying, and if advance requests are not allowed for people with degenerative diseases, then it seems as if this bill does not treat all grievous and irremediable medical conditions that people might have the same way.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319480">The minister says that Kay Carter would have been entitled to medical assistance in dying under the reasonably foreseeable natural death provision. Exactly what does “foreseeable” mean in this case? Does it have anything to do with her age? I hope that we are not talking about age discrimination here. Spinal stenosis can be intolerable at 52, 62, or 82 years of age. Age is therefore not a criterion.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319481">If we want to be thorough, we absolutely must provide a framework and amend the bill to include advance requests.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319482">Furthermore, we must remove the criterion of reasonably foreseeable natural death. Even in a situation as clear as someone in palliative care requesting death, this is not a natural death. Yes, the process of death is irreversible. The patient wants to put an end to the irreversible process of a slow death. It is up to patients to decide whether this is what they want. It is their choice. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319483">However, claims that patients will be forced to make a decision have no place in this debate. This is not the case. I have heard members say that this is frightening and that we should invest in palliative care. As I said this morning, palliative care is important, and the Quebec law addresses this issue, among other things. What about assisted suicide? These people do not need palliative care. They do not need it and we do not need to invest in palliative care to fix their problem. We simply need to respect their right to self-determination.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319484">That is why advance requests are so important. These people do not want to move forward without the assurance that they will be cared for. We are not the ones to decide for them. They will decide.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319485">Of course, sometimes there are people who suffer from insomnia. Things can happen in an instant one night. You go to bed at night and everything is fine. When you get up in the morning everything has changed. For that reason, we have to amend the bill. We must also amend the bill to include an equivalency clause, as I mentioned this morning.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319486">The debate lasted six years in Quebec. Quebec's legislation provides a very good framework for end-of-life care, and it would be unacceptable for this bill to interfere with the Quebec law.

Let us say that someone signs an advance directive when he or she is first diagnosed with dementia, for example, and later on has a change of mind. However, once that person is in a demented state, he or she is unable to sign a request and therefore has to follow through. Is the member not concerned that there could be the potential for people to die needlessly if in their present state they are enjoying life, but when they signed the advance directive they thought they would not be?

There are always means of communicating. There are people who can use signals. For example, some people have written books by blinking. An individual could prepare an advance directive and indicate that a particular signal means “yes”. Before getting to that point, I would hope that the required steps are taken.

I know this is going to be a very difficult debate in the House, as physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia are deeply emotional not only to us in the House but obviously to our constituents. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319492">First of all, I would like to say that I am very relieved to see addressed in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> some of the concerns that were raised by my Conservative colleagues and Canadians across the country. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319493">The recommendations included in the report from the Special Joint Committee on Physician-Assisted Dying were extremely troubling and went well beyond the parameters outlined in the Supreme Court's Carter decision. My Conservative colleagues and I, as well as Canadians across the country, voiced our concerns on the far-reaching recommendations in the report, and we urged the Liberal government to tighten safeguards in this legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319494">My constituents were concerned with the broad and vague guidelines in some of these recommendations. Like many of my Conservative colleagues, I felt it was very important to discuss these recommendations with my residents, and I held several open houses across the constituency. I held these open houses because I felt it was critical to get feedback from southern Albertans on their feelings on doctor-assisted dying.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319495">However, I also thought it was important to raise awareness about some of the recommendations that could potentially be part of the legislation before us. Initially, I think we saw that the vast majority of Canadians supported doctor-assisted dying, but I would like to say that I think the vast majority of those Canadians who support it were unclear about what could potentially be part of the legislation. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319496">I think in their minds, they saw doctor-assisted dying as involving an adult suffering with a terminal physical ailment, and that became abundantly clear at the open houses that I had in my constituency, which had anywhere from 30 to 300 people, including many of my rural physicians. Almost every single person at these open houses—supportive of doctor-assisted dying or not—was shocked at the potential that could have been in the legislation upon seeing the recommendations that were part of that special joint committee. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319497">These people certainly did not expect that doctor-assisted dying would be available to mature minors. They certainly did not expect it to be available to people suffering from mental illness. They also expected that there would be protection for physicians on decisions of conscience, and very strict guidelines around advance directives. Since I held those open houses and started to raise some awareness within the constituency with my residents, I received hundreds of emails and letters from residents who are very concerned about the potential ramifications in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319498">Generally, people in Foothills want to make sure that vulnerable people in our society are protected in the legislation, and I believe Canadians want the same. I am pleased to see some of the concerns that we raised are included in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, which did not include mature minors and did not include people with mental illness. However, the legislation says that those things will still be studied, which means the door is wide open for mature minors and people with mental and psychological illnesses to be part of the legislation in the future.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319499">However, there are still some other issues that I think were not addressed, such as protection for our physicians in decisions of conscience, and palliative care. In all the meetings I hosted, palliative care came up repeatedly. Many of my residents feel that palliative care was truly never addressed as part of the legislation. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319500">We are blessed to have a facility in my riding, the Foothills Country Hospice. I have toured this facility many times and spoken with patients and their families. I could see that the hospice has been a godsend—I got that from their responses—and has become such a wonderful, important part of our community.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319501">Accessible, consistent, and effective palliative care programs across the country would consistently support people in their end-of-life care. Unfortunately, palliative care is not offered on a consistent basis across this country. The report recommended that palliative care be an integral part of doctor-assisted dying legislation, and this is one recommendation in the report with which I wholeheartedly agree.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319502">If we proceed with medical-assisted dying, palliative care must be a fundamental piece of this program. However, palliative care was not mentioned in the 2016 budget, nor has there been any funding whatsoever committed to a national palliative care program.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319503">Foothills residents also spoke resoundingly about the need to protect physicians' and other medical professionals' rights of conscience. Overwhelmingly, my constituents felt that no one should be compelled to administer physician-assisted dying if doing so was contrary to their personal beliefs and ethics. Additionally, almost everyone who spoke to me recognized that referring a patient to another physician to assist in their death does not absolve that first physician from the ethical dilemma. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4319504">In my riding of Foothills, the rural towns have one or two, if any, doctors. Imposing on a doctor in a rural community to participate in doctor-assisted dying puts those rural physicians in a very difficult position in those small towns. They need to have a choice, and we need to show leadership to give them that choice. We cannot download that burden on to provinces or the provincial colleges of physicians and surgeons. Physicians across Canada need our support and our leadership, and that should be part of Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319505">In addition, there needs to be some support structure for physicians who would be participating in doctor-assisted dying. They would be facing mental health issues, as we are now seeing in Quebec. We must ensure there are programs in place to support our physicians in dealing with the potential emotional and mental scars of participating in doctor-assisted dying. Canadians want to achieve a healthy balance between the person seeking physician-assisted death and a physician's own charter rights to abstain from this procedure if it violates the physician's moral ethics and faith. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319506">The Supreme Court came up several times in conversations I had in my riding. Residents are frustrated that the Supreme Court would presume to dictate a law upon parliamentarians. Canadians understand we elect parliamentarians in our country to make laws and the Supreme Court is in place to rule on the constitutionality of those laws. They do not understand, however, why the Supreme Court, an unelected body, is now dictating law to our elected House of Commons and why it is implementing such an unreasonable timeline to come up with the law. My constituents and, I believe, many Canadians are understandably upset that this is how physician-assisted dying came forth. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319507">What does this have to do with this debate? This inversion of the process has left parliamentarians and Canadians scrambling under an unreasonable timeline to develop a complicated piece of legislation that not only ensures that the rights of all involved are protected, but also that the safety of our most vulnerable is also protected. This conversation and public debate simply require more time than has been afforded us currently.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319508">Usually at the end of any of my speeches in debate I encourage hon. members of the House to either vote in favour or against whatever piece of legislation we are debating. Today I am not going to do that. I believe the first priority in this is to ask the Supreme Court for more time. This is one of the most important decisions that we will ever make as parliamentarians, and I truly believe this is a decision that should not be made on an arbitrary timeline. The consequences of this legislation are irreversible. If we make a bad choice now, someone may die who should not have. Canadians on both sides of the issue deserve better. In fact, they deserve our best.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319509">The government has failed on this issue by not challenging the Supreme Court on this timeline. When Quebec developed similar legislation, it took more than six years. We are trying to do something similar in six months. This type of legislation should not be done in weeks. It should be done over a complete mandate of a government.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319510">As parliamentarians, can we honestly say that we have had an opportunity to consult and speak with all stakeholders? Can we really say Canadians have had enough time to digest the implications of the bill and have been given sufficient time to provide feedback to their representatives? </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319511">The Supreme Court's decision has made it clear that we will have doctor-assisted dying. As a member of Parliament, my focus here is to ensure that there are sufficient safeguards in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> to protect the most vulnerable in our society: children, people with disabilities, those with mental health issues, and our seniors. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319512">Can each of us in the House look our constituents in the eye and say we have done our due diligence in just a few weeks? Can we say with confidence that the safeguards in the legislation are properly in place to protect those who need our support and our help? In the short amount of time we have been given, I simply cannot make that claim. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319513">Unfortunately, it appears the government is not going to ask for an extension. In fact, it is no longer even putting up speakers to participate in the debate. On one of the most important issues that we will face as parliamentarians, the Liberals are not even participating. They are silencing the voice of Canadians who desperately want to talk about this important issue. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319514">I hope we all take the opportunity in the time that is left to speak to our constituents, get their feedback, raise the awareness, talk to them about what the implications of the legislation are. I know people in my riding are extremely split on where they want to go with the legislation. I hope the other parties in the House will follow the Conservatives' lead and allow all of us to have a free vote and speak for our constituents. </ParaText>

I want to begin by talking about where and how we got to this place, and build on some of the things that my colleague just talked about.

Certainly, the Supreme Court is within its purview to make these decisions that have huge and lasting implications on Canadian society. Unfortunately, what is happening is Canadians feel, and it is becoming more and more prevalent, that they have no say in these matters, whether it is issues like assisted death, which is before us right now, or legalized prostitution, which we had to deal with in the last Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319538">We are also seeing laws that have been passed in both this House and the other place that are being overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada.

Then we have our judiciary, which is a very valuable part of it, but it has become what I believe and what my constituents are telling me imbalanced.

Even though we might disagree with something that is said by a judge or a number of judges, in Canada, we respect the law and we follow the law.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319542">Again, my colleague talked about how the Liberals could have asked for more time, and certainly that is something that could have been done, but we are now at a place where we have to look at a law and either pass the law or not.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319543">I will not be able to support this piece of legislation. I believe it is flawed. My constituents have not had enough time to talk about it and be part of the process. A number of the issues that are concerning about the bill have already been articulated. I want to reinforce that I am very concerned there is not enough protection for vulnerable persons who may be victims or easily manipulated.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319544">In my previous role, I worked a lot with people with disabilities with a variety of abilities. I met recently in Winnipeg with an individual who has an intellectual disability, but is a very smart, capable individual. He said to me, “Sometimes we can be taken advantage of when we are getting a new phone. It is so easy to manipulate us.” He said, “I am worried if somebody is trying to encourage some of us to die, we can be easily manipulated.” There is very little protection in this legislation for vulnerable Canadians.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319545">There is also no protection, or very little protection, as has already been stated, for doctors, nurses, or other medical practitioners, or institutions for that matter, where killing someone goes against their conscience. The federal government has a duty to protect their rights. This bill could be strengthened by protecting those rights.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4319546">Also, it is very unclear and ambiguous, as far as language goes, around waiting times, around those who can sign for a patient, and there is very little oversight as far as who may have a financial benefit if somebody were to have an assisted death.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319547">There are number of huge concerns. More time is needed to fix these flaws and to protect the vulnerable and rights of conscience.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319548">Last, I want to talk a bit about my experience working in palliative care. I was a volunteer for a number of years. It was really something to behold to be with people as they went through those last stages of life.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319549">However, there are a lot of misconceptions about what assisted suicide is, what assisted death is. I talked to one of my friends this weekend and she said, “Well, of course, Candice, if I'm in a vegetative state, I would like to be able to have the cord unplugged. I don't want to be kept alive.” </ParaText><ParaText id="4319550"> I said to her, “That's not assisted suicide. You absolutely already have that right in Canada to have a living will, to have a do-not-resuscitate order, to refuse medical treatment.” Those are all things that are already entrenched in law and that Canadians have the right to refuse. I think even our <Affiliation DbId="214491" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation> talked a number of years ago about his own father refusing medical treatment when he had cancer. Absolutely every Canadian has that right.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319551">However, that is not at all what we are talking about today. That is not the decision that we are forced to make in a hasty way. That is not the decision that Canadians are being cheated out of being able to talk about, and being able to even, dare I say, vote on. It should be a major issue for Canadians to have major input. We are not talking about refusing treatment. We are not talking about saying “do not resuscitate”. We are not talking about palliative sedation, either.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319552">My sister passed away nine years ago from cancer. Some of my family members said, “I think she died because the doctor gave her a lot of morphine when she was in pain.” No, she did not die from the morphine. She died from the cancer. Palliative sedation is not assisted suicide.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319553">I find it ironic, in a very sad way. I just finished my 308 conversations in my riding last week. The 308 conversations was an initiative of the Canadian Mental Health Commission. It was a wonderful idea for 308—at that point 308 members of Parliament, now there are 338 of us—conversations around how we prevent suicide and how we better equip ourselves as community leaders, as health practitioners, as people working with youth, to prevent suicide.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319554"> I had these meetings. About 70 people were there, committed to preventing suicide in our communities in <Affiliation DbId="214460" Type="2">Portage—Lisgar</Affiliation>. I said, “Folks, I am now going back to Ottawa and I am going to be debating how we can help people commit suicide.”</ParaText><ParaText id="4319555">This is a very difficult issue. It is not one that we can just excuse and say, “Well, in this case, we don't want these people to die, because they're young people who have bullied on the Internet, so we want to make sure they don't commit suicide, but for somebody else who might have a mental illness and just has no hope, we want to be able to help them commit suicide.”</ParaText><ParaText id="4319556">That is wrong and I do not think we can easily reconcile the two. I think we need to talk about it and we need to have protections in place.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319557">Palliative care is very important. It is about giving hope to people. Studies show that if people have a terminal illness and they are assured they can die pain-free, they choose life and they let God decide when they go.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319558"> I think we can all agree, absolutely, that it is about helping people and giving them hope, whether it is a mental illness or whether it is a terminal illness; we give them hope and we help alleviate their pain. I do not think we ever want to see choosing death as the honourable way out. We never want our loved ones to feel like it would be more honourable if they chose death. I think we can all agree. Let us choose life every step of the way. Let us choose life.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Even now, if the current government were to talk about it in any context, there would probably be some. It is almost politically incorrect to talk about it. We should be having these conversations, whether in formal or informal groups. What would be the test? Personally, I think one of them would be that if a government decided to invoke the notwithstanding clause, it then commit to take that particular issue to the electorate so that there would be an extra layer of test on it. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319565">Those are good questions. I do not have the exact answers. All I know is that there is a growing sense of voters who feel they have less ability, when they were not even asked about the issue of assisted suicide in the election. Some of them still think that palliative sedation is assisted suicide, when it is not. There has to be a better way whereby Canadians know that they have a voice, and that our system is equally empowered so that there is not one part of our democratic system that has more power over the other.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

If passed, Bill C-247 will prevent injuries and deaths from impaired driving, which continues to cause needless and heartbreaking tragedies in communities across Canada. Specifically, Bill C-247 will increase deterrence and rates of apprehension by allowing the use of passive alcohol sensors at roadside screenings for impaired drivers. I will explain the details of that proposal shortly.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319588">In addition, Bill <Document DbId="8118649" Type="4">C-247</Document> would rename the crime of “impaired driving causing death” to “vehicular homicide” as a result of impairment. That change would denote greater moral responsibility for the crime of impaired driving, while preserving judicial discretion to tailor sentences to particular circumstances.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319589">The change is based on a proposal called <Document DbId="6848294">Kassandra's law</Document> that was brought forward in 2015 by the Conservative member for <Affiliation DbId="213926" Type="2">Langley—Aldergrove</Affiliation>. I am grateful that he has seconded Bill <Document DbId="8118649" Type="4">C-247</Document> and I am pleased that we can work together across party lines to prevent drunk driving for the benefit of all Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319590">Impaired driving has touched constituents in every riding across the country. My riding of Mississauga—Streetsville is no exception. Last year during the summer, my constituents lost a local leader, educator, mentor, and most importantly a father and a husband. Out of respect for the family, I will refrain from using his name.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319591">Sadly, one night during July of 2015, while riding his bicycle, he was struck from behind by an impaired driver and pronounced dead at the scene. As a secondary school teacher, he spent years dedicating his time to educating and inspiring youth within my riding. His former students and those who knew him conveyed to me what a positive impact he made on those around him. I understand that he inspired many of his students to pursue post-secondary education.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319592">Tragically his life was cut short by an intoxicated driver, someone who chose to put lives at risk rather than call a cab. His death denied five children their father, denied a wife her husband, denied students their teacher, and denied future young people a mentor who could have helped them make positive choices in life.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319593">Soon after being elected, I received an email from a constituent who was greatly saddened by what had happened and also concerned that such senseless tragedies continued to occur at alarming rates in our country. She implored me to take action, and I am now doing so with Bill <Document DbId="8118649" Type="4">C-247</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319594">As I said, if passed, the bill will prevent injuries and deaths from impaired driving. It will do this with two measures to increase deterrence and rates of apprehension. The first measure authorizes the use of passive alcohol sensors at roadside screenings for impaired drivers. What would this change mean?</ParaText><ParaText id="4319595">Currently law enforcement in Canada conducts organized stops at check points to screen drivers for impairment. For example, Ontario conducts a program called reduce impaired driving everywhere, RIDE. When stopping drivers, officers apply breath tests if they, through odour or appearance, reasonably suspect a driver has consumed alcohol. However, according to a 2009 report of the House Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, only a small fraction of impaired drivers are currently apprehended.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319596">Bill <Document DbId="8118649" Type="4">C-247</Document> would increase apprehension and deterrence by authorizing the use of passive alcohol sensors by police at organized stops, or when they had reasonable grounds to make a stop for suspected impairment. Passive alcohol sensors detect alcohol when placed near a driver's face. A positive reading would provide reasonable grounds to conduct a breath test on an approved screening device.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319597"> I am confident that the use of passive alcohol sensors at organized roadside screenings will be charter compliant. I say this because, in its decision in Dedman v. The Queen, the Supreme Court held that the somewhat random searches in Ontario's RIDE program were constitutional because driving was a “licensed activity that is subject to regulation and control for the protection of life and property.” The legal takeaway is that driving is a licensed activity that is subject to reasonable limits because of the risk to others who share the roads. Using passive alcohol sensors would be a reasonable limit that is far more effective at catching impaired drivers than the current method employed at roadside screenings.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319598">Mothers Against Drunk Driving Canada has endorsed Bill <Document DbId="8118649" Type="4">C-247</Document>, citing passive alcohol sensors' benefits. Andrew Murie, CEO of MADD Canada, said, “The ability for police to use Passive Alcohol Sensors will have a great impact on reducing the number of alcohol impaired drivers on our roadways. This private member bill...will allow police to maximize the technology that is available to detect drinking drivers at roadside. MADD Canada appreciates [these efforts] to lower the number of alcohol related crashes, deaths and injuries”.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4319599">Now I want to spend some time on the second measure in Bill <Document DbId="8118649" Type="4">C-247</Document>. As I said, the bill would also rename the crime of “impaired driving causing death” to “vehicular homicide”. This change would denote greater moral culpability, and that is appropriate. The decision to get behind the wheel while impaired is completely reckless, and the devastating consequences are predictable. A conviction should reflect that culpability.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319600"> To raise a recent example, this is the crime for which Marco Muzzo recently received a 10-year sentence for killing three children and their grandfather. That tragedy was directly caused by his decision to get behind the wheel, with a blood-alcohol level nearly three times the legal limit.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319601">The Criminal Code of Canada states that a person commits homicide when directly or indirectly by any means causes the death of a human being. Drunk driving causing death would be a form of culpable homicide because it is morally and legally blameworthy. The moment an impaired driver gets behind the wheel, he or she puts others at risk. Words carry weight, they are not empty, and this culpability needs to be accurately reflected in Canadian law. At the same time, this change would preserve judicial discretion to tailor sentences to individual circumstances. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319602">The proposal to call the crime of impaired driving causing death what it really is, vehicular homicide, was originally brought forward as Kassandra's law after Kassandra Kaulius of Surrey, B.C., a 22-year-old victim of impaired driving. The Conservative member for <Affiliation DbId="213926" Type="2">Langley—Aldergrove</Affiliation> tabled Kassandra's law as Bill <Document DbId="6848294" Type="4">C-652</Document> in the previous Parliament, and again I am pleased that he has seconded Bill <Document DbId="8118649" Type="4">C-247</Document>. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319603">Last week, I had the opportunity to meet with Kassandra's parents, Markita and Victor. When I was discussing this upcoming speech, Victor pointed out that today, May 3, will mark five years to the day that their beautiful 22-year-old daughter lost her life. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319604">Throughout her life, Kassandra was a lively and enthusiastic person who loved sports. As her parents recall, from the time she was three years old she was already running around her family's backyard playing sports with her older siblings. As she got older, her passion for sports grew. She competed on her high school volleyball, basketball, and softball teams, eventually receiving athletic scholarships, and had dreams of one day becoming a teacher.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319605">On the one hand, the inspiration behind this bill was a teacher who inspired students and whose life was unjustly taken from him. On the other hand, part of the bill has been named after a young woman who dreamed of becoming a teacher and whose life was unjustly taken from her.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319606">I also want to mention Families For Justice, the organization Markita and Victor have worked so hard to establish and have used to promote awareness of impaired driving. They have collected over 100,000 signatures in support of their cause. I commend their efforts to provide support and counselling services for families that have lost loved ones.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319607">I do not need to remind the House of the harms of impaired driving. According to MADD, impaired driving continues to be the leading criminal cause of death in Canada, claiming almost twice as many lives per year as all categories of homicide combined.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319608"> In 2010, impaired driving accounted for approximately 1,082 deaths, 63,281 injuries, and $20.62 billion in financial and social costs. What is important to note is the fact that Statistics Canada indicates that 53% of all adult victims were between the ages of 18 and 35. This means that Canada is being denied young minds that would shape the future of the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319609">Furthermore, our country's impaired driving record has been, and remains, poor in comparison to other developed countries. Millions of Canadians continue to drive after drinking, one reason being they believe they can do so with relatively little fear of being apprehended.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319610"> An international review of 15 countries reported that Canada has the second-highest rate of alcohol involvement in fatal crashes. Similarly, a Transport Canada study found that Canada had the highest rate of impairment among fatally injured drivers of eight countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Furthermore, Canada had the highest rate of alcohol-related traffic fatalities as a percentage of total fatalities among 13 countries. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319611">Although the selective breath testing programs that are currently in place are a productive step toward preventing impaired driving, the majority of impaired drivers go undetected at sobriety checkpoints. MADD reports that of the four million to five million drivers who are stopped each year at sobriety checkpoints, less than 1% are subject to roadside breath testing on an approved screening device.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319612"> It is for this reason that the main measure in my bill, the authorization of passive alcohol sensors, is evidence-based and necessary. These devices detect the presence and approximate amount of alcohol in a driver's exhaled breath by sampling the ambient air near his or her mouth.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4319613">The device also contains a pump that draws in air over a sensor that reacts to alcohol and registers a reading within a matter of seconds.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319614"> Passive alcohol sensors provide an easy, reliable and non-intrusive method of efficiently screening a large number of drivers with minimal delay, which will ultimately save more lives each year.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319615">Passive alcohol sensors have been around for some time. The technology is not new, however, initially they were units on their own. It is important to note that when discussing passive alcohol sensors, for the most part, we are simply discussing a feature built into many of the approved screening devices already carried by peace officers. This means that the express authorization of a passive alcohol sensor would most likely allow officers to use their current devices, optimizing the tools already available to them.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319616">As Robert Solomon, a law professor at Western University, has said, “...currently nothing preventing Canadian police from using PASs”.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319617">Regardless, amendments to the Criminal Code explicitly authorizing police to use passive alcohol sensors would be effective. It would create a national standard which would ultimately reduce the confusion that otherwise arises from having 13 different provincial and territorial enforcement powers and practices. Police officers would also be more likely to use PASs if they are given express statutory authority to do so. Furthermore, the publicity surrounding the introduction of a national passive alcohol sensor program together with the knowledge that police officers are using more sophisticated detection methods would increase the perceived risk of apprehension and ultimately have a deterrent impact.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319618">Over the past months, I have consulted with numerous police officers and police chiefs all over the country.

While I will not be able to support the bill for reasons that I will explain momentarily, I do want to acknowledge that this legislation is well intentioned and that the objectives of the hon. member are noble.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319637">Impaired driving is the leading cause of criminal death in Canada. In 2016, that is simply unacceptable. However, that being said, it is important to acknowledge that over the last several decades, Canada has come a long way to combatting impaired driving. Indeed, over the last two decades, the percentage of motor vehicle deaths involving impaired drivers has decreased. In some year-to-year comparisons, there have perhaps been increases, but the trend line is clear and they are going down. While that is not a reason to celebrate, it is evidence that the combination of public awareness, policing efforts, and legislative changes over the last several decades are having a positive effect.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319638"> Nonetheless, there continues to be people who drink, drive, and cause carnage on our roads. These are people like Johnathan Pratt. He was someone who, in 2011, killed three young men outside of Beaumont, Alberta. Pratt was more than three times over the legal limit, driving 199 kilometres an hour down a highway when he rammed into a vehicle occupied by the young men, effectively crushing them to death.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319639">Then there is Roger Walsh, someone who killed a wheelchair-bound woman while he was impaired and behind the wheel. This was Walsh's nineteenth conviction for impaired driving.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319640">The vast majority of Canadians understand that impaired driving is dangerous, that it is illegal, and most importantly that it is wrong. The vast majority of Canadians not only understand those facts, but are heeding the message and choosing not to get behind the wheel while impaired.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319641">However, there are some who continue to do so. There is no one profile of an impaired driver. There are many instances of people who rarely drive impaired, or perhaps someone decides to do so one fateful night and in turn causes injury or death on the road. However, a big part of the problem in terms of those who are causing carnage on our roads is that they are regular, repeat, hard-core drunk drivers.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319642">The question that we must ask as parliamentarians is, how do we deal with a relatively small number of people who are causing a disproportionate amount of grief, death, and injury on our roads? The answer is that we need to ensure that those types of offenders are held accountable to the fullest extent of the law. Unfortunately, some of the laws on the books today are simply not doing the job to the degree that they ought to.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4319643">That is why I was very pleased to see that my colleague, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="213870" Type="2">Bellechasse—Les Etchemins—Lévis</Affiliation>, introduced a private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="8102913" Type="4">C-226</Document>. Bill C-226 contains some important measures to hold serious impaired driving offenders accountable. It would impose a mandatory minimum for an impaired driver who causes death. It would increase sentencing for impaired drivers who cause bodily harm from 10 years to 14 years. It would also allow for consecutive sentencing for impaired drivers who cause multiple deaths to ensure that every victim of impaired driving is accounted for.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319644">When it comes to holding regular, repeat, and hard-core drunk drivers accountable, unfortunately, unlike Bill <Document DbId="8102913" Type="4">C-226</Document>, I believe that Bill <Document DbId="8118649" Type="4">C-247</Document> falls short. While Bill C-247 falls short in this regard, it would impose a form of random breath testing, passive alcohol sensors. Certainly I would acknowledge that Bill C-226 does not contain passive sensors, but I have some reservations about any form of random breath testing.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319645">Under sections 8 and 9 of the charter, it would most certainly run afoul. It is quite arguable that it could be saved under section 1 of the charter, and I believe there would be a reasonable chance that it would be saved. However, the issue is what impact it will have in reducing the number of impaired drivers and deaths on our roads. The evidence is mixed on that question.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319646">Indeed, there is some body of statistical evidence that indicates this type of testing has no more impact in reducing impaired driving than things that are currently employed by law enforcement, such as checkstops. Indeed, in the city of Edmonton in the last few years, one thing that had the biggest impact in reducing impaired driving was the city posting signs saying that if people see impaired drivers, they should phone 911. Therefore, I think we have to perhaps look at other alternatives to random breath testing. What is more, I believe this legislation just does not cut it when it comes to holding the most serious offenders accountable for impaired driving. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319647">It is on that basis that I regretfully will not support this particular bill. However, I want to commend the hon. member for bringing it forward, because it is an important debate and an important issue that Parliament must continue to address.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We think that it is a way to better detect alcohol. However, the fact remains that the problem of impaired driving is much more complex than that. This is just one of many measures that need to be implemented to better detect impaired driving.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319649">The bill would allow police officers to use passive alcohol detection devices. A passive detection device is a meter with a display of coloured stripes that light up when the presence of alcohol is detected in the ambient air. In order for a police officer to administer a breathalyzer test, he must have grounds to suspect that the person consumed alcohol. That does not necessarily mean that the police officer needs grounds to suspect that the person is drunk, just that he or she consumed alcohol. The police officer can then administer a breathalyzer test.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319650">This device would not be used to collect evidence, but it would help give police officers the grounds they need to conduct breathalyzer tests and perhaps detect more people who have been drinking. It could help prevent impaired driving. Every year, too many families are the victims of impaired driving. That is why we must make use of all of the tools available. However, we need to do a lot more to prevent drunk driving. There are many factors to consider. In rural areas, it is a matter of infrastructure, of public transit, or organizations that provide driver services. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319651">When people do not really have any options for getting home after a night out, it may, unfortunately, make our roads less safe. We need to look at those aspects of the issue. Data indicates that it can take up to three years before a person who regularly drives drunk is caught by the police.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319652">For instance, in our rural regions, people who drink might decide to use back roads that have less traffic to get home, in order to avoid roadside checks. There are also people who drink in the morning. By noon, these people could already be impaired. Roadblocks are more often set up at night. This does not necessarily allow authorities to catch everyone who might be impaired. Furthermore, this might not be the first thing an officer thinks of when they stop someone for running a stop sign at 11 a.m., for example. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319653">Using the tool in question, we would be able to better screen these individuals, so it is a good tool, but we need to do a lot more to discourage people from driving while impaired. Of course, any time we increase the risk of being arrested, the risk of being caught, that can have an impact on the number of drunk drivers, but we need to do a lot more.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319654">Unfortunately, there are people who are repeat offenders. It is really hard to put an end to this. We also see cases where there is no doubt about the person's state. When these people decide to drive while impaired but do not hurt anyone, the consequences are relatively minor, so they may continue doing it for quite a while, and as a result, the safety of the public is at risk during that entire period.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319655">It is therefore important to take a more enlightened approach and examine the problem of drinking and driving in its entirety.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319656">As I said, we will be supporting the measure introduced by my colleague, but it is just one small measure among many much larger initiatives that should be implemented to actually reduce the problem of drinking and driving.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4319657">In my riding, a disproportionate number of people drive under the influence. For example, in the RCM of Témiscamingue, which has the smallest population of the four RCMs I represent, there are more drunk driving incidents. It is also the largest RCM in terms of size, and there is little in the way of taxi service.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319658">Ville-Marie is the biggest city in the RCM of Témiscamingue, and I believe there is one single taxi in operation there, and it is not available nights. This points to a lack of infrastructure. There is no taxi service because there is not enough demand, and there are no local services to drive people home. That can cause people to take risks they should not take. Locally, there is a lot of awareness-raising going on. Groups are trying to make people understand that they have to plan how to get home before they start drinking. This work is never done.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319659">Organizations that try to prevent drinking and driving should receive more support, especially in rural regions where people have few alternatives. We cannot tell them to take the bus, walk, or ride their bike. It is simply impossible. Some people live 30 kilometres from town. It is very hard. Taking a taxi is not really an option either. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319660">When it comes to drinking and driving, there has to be a better strategy than passive detection devices. We have to gain a better understanding of the situation and take the time to talk with the people on the ground. We have to talk to people convicted of impaired driving, in order to determine what they could have done to avoid taking the wheel. We have to learn from past mistakes in order to prevent the loss of lives. It is not easy.</ParaText>

							<ParaText id="4319662">When we see such situations, we can only hope that more efforts will be made to solve the problem of drunk driving. We have been working on this for years, and I do not believe that we are going to solve the problem by taking a piecemeal approach. We have to have a comprehensive plan. I hope that such a plan will be introduced and that we will take a giant step forward in the fight against impaired driving.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319663">We must not forget that many Canadians have lost a loved one because of drunk driving. I hope that my children will never be exposed to this danger, that I will be able to provide them with infrastructure, and that I will teach them to be responsible when it comes to drinking. I hope that more lives will not be lost and that more families will not be broken.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319664">I am pleased to express my views on this matter.

He has shared with me some of the stories, as he did today about Kassandra's death, but other things have compelled him to respond with this private member's bill, and I want to commend him for his passion and commitment in bringing this important issue forward. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319668">The social impact of impaired driving in Canada cannot be overstated. We have heard a number of statistics, but it is important to actually break those down into the impact it is having on families and communities across this country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319669">Each year, on average, nearly 1,500 Canadians lose their lives as a direct result of a decision some Canadian has made to operate a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol. That means, on average, that each and every day in this country nearly four people lose their lives, and there are very few families and no communities that have not been impacted by this terrible crime. As has already been stated, impaired driving is the number one leading cause of criminal death in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319670">As my colleague the member for <Affiliation DbId="213892" Type="2">St. Albert—Edmonton</Affiliation> has indicated, we have seen some improvement over the past number of decades in societal condemnation and in the number of impaired drivers we see; but there is so much more work to be done.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319671">It is important to reflect on why we have seen some of those reductions. I was actually a young police officer in 1979 when the first roadside screening program was established in the city of Toronto, the RIDE program, which is now “reduce impaired driving everywhere” but began as “reduce impaired driving in Etobicoke”. As young police officers, we were sent out with the task of randomly pulling over vehicles on the street to determine if their drivers had been drinking and driving. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319672">That program had two very important purposes. The first purpose was to detect the people who were driving impaired and to hold them responsible for their conduct. However, perhaps most importantly and most impactfully, it had the effect of sending a very clear message about society's condemnation of impaired driving, the seriousness with which we as a society and our police and courts took this offence. It also created a stronger impression among the population that this was a crime, a crime that would be dealt with effectively, a crime where we would increase the likelihood of detection, where there was a greater certainty of consequences and that those consequences would be significant and serious enough to deter that criminal behaviour.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319673">We have also seen some additional tools and technologies that have enhanced our ability to be more effective in those roadside stops. For example, many years ago, roadside screening devices were developed that enabled police officers to administer a test on the basis of reasonable suspicion of those people who we believed had been consuming alcohol prior to operating a motor vehicle.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319674">If I may, I will explain to my colleagues a little bit how that is done. I actually got a fair bit of experience at roadside RIDE spot checks as a police officer in Toronto. I think for the last 20 years, I have spent every New Year's Eve standing along the roadway with a number of other police officers pulling over cars. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319675">When we do that, as a car is going through the spot check, the police officer will stop the driver and make certain observations and certain inquiries. Among the observations, the officer will will try to detect the scent of alcohol on the driver or glassy eyes or slurred speech. We would ask those drivers if they had been drinking alcohol.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319676"> If we make observations that cause us to be suspicious that the driver has been consuming alcohol—and it has to be a reasonable suspicion, not a mere suspicion but not at the level of reasonable, probable grounds—police officers are empowered in law to make a demand for the driver to submit to a roadside screening test, the consequences of which can lead to other things I will speak of. However, because we stop literally thousands of cars in an evening in this way, the opportunity to detect if the individual has been consuming alcohol is somewhat limited.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4319677">The experience of police officers across this country in conducting those all important random stops has been that people do not not admit to having consumed alcohol or the signs of consumption are not obvious. We know that many people avoid detection, notwithstanding the enormous amount of resources and effort being put into making a difference in our communities. It is quite obvious to those of us who have worked out on the streets in our communities and seen the carnage, seen the impact it has on families, seen the literally thousands of people who have lost loved ones to impaired driving, that we must do more.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319678">Our current court system is processing nearly 60,000 criminal cases each and every year related to impaired driving. In addition to that, there are literally tens of thousands of injuries as a result of the decision that some people make to drink and drive. We must do more. The private member's bill brought forward by my friend from <Affiliation DbId="213908" Type="2">Mississauga—Streetsville</Affiliation> gives the police authorities one more tool to enable them to do their job.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319679">Bill <Document DbId="8118649" Type="4">C-247</Document> proposes to amend the Criminal Code to specifically authorize the police to use a device referred to as a passive detection device, often referred to as a passive alcohol sensor, at the roadside in an effort to better detect impaired drivers. These sensors are able to detect alcohol in the ambient air. It does not require that the driver blow into a machine. It can provide police officers with a reasonable suspicion that would enable them to make a demand for a roadside screening device to be administered.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319680">Not two weeks ago there was another private member's bill brought forward in this House by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="213870" Type="2">Bellechasse—Les Etchemins—Lévis</Affiliation>. In that bill, he made a number of very important proposals. Many members, representing all parties, stood in this House to express their concern about the need to do more with respect to impaired driving. I would submit that the private member's bill that we are speaking to today is along very similar lines. It is one additional and important tool that may enable us to keep our communities safe.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319681">Historically, there have been a number of things that we know can make a difference in preventing crime in our society. One of the most significant things that we can do as a society is to increase the likelihood of detection and conviction for those who would choose to commit a crime. We know that the offence of impaired driving often goes undetected even at roadside screening sites where the police are randomly stopping cars. We know that the proposed private member's bill would increase the likelihood of detection.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319682">We also know it is important to reinforce societal condemnation of impaired driving. We can do that through public education. We can do it by advising people of the risks and consequences of driving impaired. I can give an example of when the increased likelihood of detection and consequences made a real difference to the safety of our communities.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319683"> In many jurisdictions across this country, drivers under the age of 21 are required to drive free of all alcohol and are subject to administrative suspension if they choose to drink and drive. The likelihood of consequences at the roadside screening events has had a very significant effect on drivers under 21 right across this country choosing not to drink and drive. It has changed the societal attitudes among those young people about drinking and driving and has made our roadways safer. Anything that we can do to improve the decisions that people make about not drinking and driving will make our roadways safer.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319684">In the limited time that I have, I also want to make some reference to the other important element of Bill <Document DbId="8118649" Type="4">C-247</Document>, which proposes to change the name of two impaired driving offences. This bill proposes to rename two impaired driving offences, specifically the offence of impaired driving causing death and the offence of “over 80” causing death, to vehicular homicide as a result of impairment. I think there is cause to consider both of these recommendations. I look forward to having the opportunity to bring this matter before the justice committee for further discussion.</ParaText>

In essence, and I put it in the form of a question earlier, the member for <Affiliation DbId="213908" Type="2">Mississauga—Streetsville</Affiliation> has put together a bill on what I believe is a very important constituency issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319700">As a number of members might be aware, I have been around as a parliamentarian for a number of years. Both I and my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214246" Type="2">Winnipeg South Centre</Affiliation>, were first elected back in 1988. I can recall shortly thereafter trying to canvass the residents I represented at that time on what issues were important to them. One of the issues that came up back then was drinking and driving. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319701">The member has been with us now for just over eight months, a number of sitting days, and he has already hit on what I think is an important constituency issue. I applaud him in recognizing an issue that really does matter. He has brought forward this legislation which we anticipate will ultimately come to a vote in the House. Hopefully, we will see it pass to committee stage. I know the member is open to receiving amendments and I suspect there is a very good chance we will see something coming down.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319702">I want to add some of my thoughts with respect to the legislation itself. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319703">The member who spoke earlier, the former chief of police, I believe for the Toronto area, talked about societal attitudes and the degree to which society has really changed in this regard. I thought it was interesting when he made reference to the fact that it was back in 1979, I think, when we started to see these roadside awareness campaigns take place.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319704">Before 1979, back in 1975 and 1976, I can recall pumping gas at the age of 12 or 13 years at a car lot and in the background there were mechanics and others deeply engaged in drinking alcoholic beverages and who thought nothing of getting behind the wheel and driving away. It was something that was not frowned upon whatsoever. In fact, when I was in high school, they even had names for individuals who got caught drinking and driving, and it was in reference to a dollar amount of a particular fine.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319705">How things have changed. I go to graduation ceremonies, as we all do, and I find it is the young people of Canada, in recent years in particular, who are leading the charge in terms of changing the attitudes with respect to drinking and driving. We will see safe grads taking place at the local high schools throughout our communities. Individual guests are allowed to participate in the graduation activities but they have to sign something, or if the young people know they are going to be drinking, they have to have a designated driver. I have seen safe grads booklets, literally booklets in terms of responsibilities. Whether it is at Sisler High School, Maples Collegiate, R.B. Russell Vocational School, St. John's High School, and others, just in the north end of Winnipeg alone, they have recognized how important it is to have a change in attitude. That change started, I believe, back in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when we started to see police forces across our country following, in part, but also leading in terms of the need to change societal attitudes. For all of those who have done that, I applaud their efforts.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319706">As has been pointed out far too often, every day there are hundreds of individuals who lose their lives as a direct result of drinking and driving. What a terrible way to lose a life, because someone made the stupid decision to get behind the wheel of a car and drive while intoxicated.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="25">(1825)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4319707">We need to look at ways to change that situation. That is also not to mention the thousands of Canadians who are affected every year through loss of limbs and other types of injuries that are sustained. When we talk about those victims, it does not include the victims who are family members who have to endure the loss of a loved one, or those individuals who are going to have to provide the care that is necessary. That could include everything from a broken limb to someone being paralyzed. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319708">The costs to society are huge, both socially and economically. That is the reason that when we look at good government policy, we should be looking at the initiatives that could really make a difference. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319709">My understanding of the passive alcohol detection device that the member is making reference to is that it would assist police in ensuring a higher level of detection. That is something we need to pursue because, for whatever reasons, there are some who are very slow at understanding the importance of not drinking and driving. Here we have a suggestion, through legislation, that could have a profound and positive impact in dealing with the issue of drinking and driving and prevent others from doing that. As legislators, where we can take action on issues of this nature, I believe we should.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319710"> In my question to the member, I made reference to the fact that our police agencies of all sorts do a phenomenally good job in keeping our streets and communities a safe place. In doing that, they have a number of tools that they can use. What is being suggested in the legislation is yet another tool. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319711">If we need to look at ways to change the law that would enhance a police officer's ability to make our streets safer, we should be exploring that. That is the reason, without hesitation, why I stand in my place today to applaud the member's efforts. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319712">The member has said that he is open to amendments. I look forward to the bill hitting committee stage in anticipation that at the end of the day we will have a safer community because the member took the initiative to make a difference and bring forward a piece of legislation that could ultimately save lives and contribute to making our communities safer. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

When legislation like this comes before us, we always sit long hours. I certainly want to thank the members of the Conservative party for the dissenting report. It was great to see that at least some of those ideas were worked upon in the legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319717">This House finds itself in a position where we must pass an effective regulatory framework to make way for medically assisted suicide. I am rising today to help ensure that this new framework respects the charter rights of physicians and patients alike. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319718">It is my fear that the proposals put forward by the government in an attempt to bring our laws in line with the charter may in fact do the opposite. I believe there is a potential to break with the charter by not effectively protecting the rights of physicians to practise according to their freedom of religion and conscience.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319719">Additionally, I fear that the government's promise to revisit this legislation in a few years simply gives it an opportunity to further expand it. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319720">As a member of the opposition party, I feel compelled to warn the House of what I fear might happen if the bill is passed in its current form. I believe that decisions such as this can inevitably lead down a slippery slope.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319721">While the government has chosen to forego many of the more contentious recommendations made by the joint special committee, Liberal and NDP members of that committee clearly felt confident in the recommendations. This leads me to believe that, in time, this law will be expanded even further to include those measures.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319722">The Supreme Court was quite clear in its ruling. Access to assisted suicide was to be limited to a “competent adult” person who “clearly consents to the termination of life” and has “a grievous and irremediable medical condition (including an illness, disease or disability) that causes enduring suffering that is intolerable to the individual in the circumstances of his or her condition.”</ParaText><ParaText id="4319723">I am happy to see that the government has listened to some of the recommendations made by my hon. colleagues in their dissenting report. In that report, they referenced a system currently used in Quebec, where only patients aged 18 and older with severe incurable physical illnesses, and whose medical condition is characterized by an advanced and irreversible decline, can request medical help to die.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319724">Furthermore, in Quebec, the attending physician must ensure that his or her patient has clearly consented to physician-assisted suicide, ensuring, among other things, that it was not the result of external pressure, while also providing the patient with a full prognosis on the condition and possible treatment options along with the likely consequences.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319725">Quebec physicians are free to act according to their conscience. If they do not want to proceed, they must refer the patient to an independent body which will contact another physician. Two independent physicians must confirm that the patient meets all of the criteria prescribed by the legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319726">Keeping in mind the Quebec system and considering the irreversibility of assisted suicide, we must acknowledge that the realities of this practice as a form of treatment permanently ends a human life. As such, we must exercise great caution to ensure that there are effective safeguards against any abuse of the system.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319727">I understand that the <Affiliation DbId="214328" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> has said that physicians cannot be prosecuted under the bill for failing to comply with a patient's desire to end their life. The absence of any specific mention of this in the legislation that was brought forward is troubling. Without a specific reference to the rights of physicians to act according to their conscience, I believe it will not be long before doctors are facing lawsuits for failure to comply with a patient who wishes to die.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319728">Again, while I am glad to see the government has decided not to include certain recommendations that the committee made, I feel it is necessary that I voice my objections to them before the government decides to add them at a future date.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319729">I am doing this because my constituents are very concerned about this issue. I have received dozens of letters and calls from people in my riding, and they all want me to warn of the consequences that opening this door may bring. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319730">I will touch on some of the most at-risk parts of society as far as assisted suicide is concerned, namely the young, the elderly, and those who suffer from mental illness.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319731">In the preamble to the bill, the government said that it would leave the door open for non-legislative measures involving requests for assisted suicide from “mature minors, advance requests and requests where mental illness is the sole underlying medical condition”. This is where I take the most issue with this bill. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319732">What the Liberals call “mature minors” are people who are not allowed to buy alcohol or vote, and people who are subject to a different set of criminal standards than adults.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319733">The Government of Canada, for many decades, has been of the opinion that while all citizens are entitled to their constitutional rights, there are what we call reasonable limits on certain rights. What I mean by this is that the rights of an individual stop when they directly conflict with the rights of another individual. Therefore, there is no primacy of one constitutional right over another.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4319734">Now that the right to assisted suicide has been added to that list, I believe it should not now or in the future be made available to minors. When setting the voting age or creating the Youth Criminal Justice Act, governments create a different system for people who are not yet adults. The rationale for these differences comes from the medically accepted fact that the human brain is not fully developed until around the age of 18.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319735">With respect to the possibility of providing assisted suicide to requests where mental illness is the sole underlying medical condition, I have two points. First, the Supreme Court did not mention mental illness in its ruling. Second, the court said that individuals seeking assisted suicide must be fully competent.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319736">To that point, I would ask the government this. When a predisposition toward suicide is often a side effect of mental illness, how are doctors supposed to decide when the decision to die is the true wish of the patient or merely the effect of their condition? Is this a decision that we really want to force upon our doctors?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319737">Another group of individuals that I fear may be exploited as part of this system are the elderly. Elder abuse is already a well-known problem in Canada and, no matter what actions the government takes, it is difficult to stop it entirely. The inevitable consequences of access to assisted suicide is that the elderly are put at risk of being exploited.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319738">In jurisdictions where assisted suicide is legal, there have been cases of elderly people seeking the service because they feel they have become a burden to their family or to society. There have been even worse examples, such as situations where the elderly person's own family has pressured him or her into seeking assisted suicide. We cannot allow this to become a feature of the system.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319739">What we do need to do is to help our elderly folks, providing them with a better system of palliative care.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319740">During last year's election, the Liberals promised to invest $3 billion on new palliative care. However, when the budget was released, there was nothing. I know that a number of my colleagues have raised this in other speeches, so I will not get it into in any greater detail. However, this is part of a broad theme of the Liberals breaking campaign promises during their high-spending agenda in many other areas.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319741">Earlier, I spoke of my fears that the rights of doctors to operate according to their own conscience and religious convictions may be supplanted with this new right that the Supreme Court has granted.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319742">I have seen arguments from people who say that doctors should have no right to deny such treatment, especially if they are working in isolated areas. To those people, I would say that we all have constitutionally protected rights, and one of those rights is that of the individual to practise their religion unhindered by the government. Each major religion in Canada disapproves of suicide in one way or another. Many of our doctors subscribe to and conduct themselves according to these religious beliefs. We cannot allow the rights of assisted suicide to replace the rights to practise one's religion or to follow one's conscience.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319743">I want to add that I have had a number of religious nursing homes in my riding, Grimsby, Vineland, United Mennonite, saying “What happens if the doctors refuse? Does it now fall on us, as an institution, to try to carry out their wills?”</ParaText><ParaText id="4319744">These are some of the things that I think need further discussion.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319745">We, as parliamentarians, must ensure that the proper safeguards are in place to prevent exploitation of the system. That is why I join with my colleagues on this side of the aisle in cautioning against moving too fast and too far on this issue.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319746"> Our goal, first and foremost, should not be to extend assisted suicide to patients, but to protect patients from it. By this, I mean a strong regulatory regime is required, one that would ensure that only those with incurable diseases and unconscionable suffering are granted access to this treatment. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319747">We cannot make this a common form of treatment. It must be the absolute last resort.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319748">This is by far the number one reason that my constituents have written to my office in recent days. I tell them what I am saying right now. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319749">We cannot allow this system to become the norm. We must ensure that the first priority of this legislation is to protect human life. We cannot allow minors, whether mature or not, access to a system that ensures they have no future. We need to partner with the provinces and tackle mental illness rather than making suicide a more valid alternative. We also need to further the partnership to support palliative care.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319750">I know that I am very fortunate. In Grimsby, we have the McNally House Hospice, which is well sponsored and well looked after in the community. I know in the greater region of Niagara that we have a number of facilities that people support in a big way. They give access to late-in-life care to more elderly members of society, therefore reducing the risk of elder abuse. I believe that is very important, and I realize that is not what every community has in this country. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319751">We must, above all else, treat this issue with the same care that we would expect our doctors to provide to us.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The work was done in Quebec for many months and years in advancing this conversation forward. There seems to be some reluctance in the country to talk about end of life. It is not a comfortable conversation for many Canadians. It is not one that often happens even within families to a proper level before that time comes. We all wrestle and grapple with these issues. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319753">Once the Supreme Court decision came down, we joined with the then Liberals in opposition to suggest that a special committee be struck. The then government voted against that and wasted many precious months in hearing from an even broader spectrum of Canadians than we were able to since the last federal election. However, that all happened and now we are here.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319754">The member mentioned something about the conscientious objectors. This is my question. We note that it is in the preamble of the bill, but not in the structure of the bill itself. There are those in the medical profession who, for whatever reasons, be they religious or personal beliefs, do not wish to practice physician-assisted death. Yet it does not appear in the text of the bill itself. For those who have been around Parliament a bit, they know there is a difference between those two things in terms of its strength.</ParaText>

I mentioned earlier in my speech that caregivers approached me in my office from various religious nursing homes and nursing facilities, which obviously have a very conscientious view of life and how important it is to them. One concern they had was that in smaller communities, there may not be many doctors or people may not have as many options, maybe not even palliative care, for that matter. If a doctor did not want to perform that service, what would happen? Would it mean that the responsibility would go back to the nursing home or care facility? That is a concern.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319757">To maybe echo the question back to the member, that is one of the things we need to strengthen. We need to ensure it is not just in the preamble but in the actual legislation, so there can be protection for those with conscience and want to act according to their faiths.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The legislation has in it the need for two independent witnesses and two independent doctors. That is a big improvement over what we thought might come from the committee report. Yet there is no regime in place to ensure that those two supposed independent witnesses and doctors are actually independent.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319760">Would my colleague support an amendment that would include some type of prior review, which would mandate either a judicial or a tribunal review to ensure that the assertions being made were actually factual?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

One thing that concerns me is how far the report actually went. While I appreciate where the government legislation landed and that it is not perfect, my concern is what will happen in the future as we look to review these kinds of things. What happens then? Do we push it further?</ParaText><ParaText id="4319763">We have seen before that if we do not clearly articulate the legislation, it becomes very easy to push the limit, to move around the edges, and then say we thought it meant something else or maybe we could go in a direction that was not originally intended by the people who were there at the time.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319764">I, by all means, would support a notion like that.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Yet, as I approached Parliament this evening, thinking about this particular debate, I found myself struggling to use the word “pleasure”. It is simply because this debate strikes at the very heart of some of the most difficult questions we face as legislators, that we face as Canadians, that we face as friends and family of those who have faced the incredible difficulty of end of life.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319766">There has been a certain amount of trepidation and perhaps fear from many of us in this place to talk about end of life, end-of-life care, the palliative care question, and to talk about end of life and the issue of medical assistance and dying, physician-assisted suicide.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319767">I suppose there are some things required of us all in this debate. One is to fully appreciate and understand that great sense of responsibility and to bring to this conversation as much humility as we can muster. For some of us in elected office, humility is not always at the ready and available. It is also perhaps to bring the best wisdom we can from those who know a great deal more about this subject than we might.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319768">Oftentimes we say we have to separate the personal from the political, that we as legislators have to act purely in the best means and understanding that we have about the law and how we wish to craft the it in a way that is defensible at the Supreme Court, and is representative of our constituents. Yet, this debate brings those two things together for many of us.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319769">This is incredibly personal for any who have stood in the House and spoken to this bill, or who will, if one reflects back on any experiences we have had with family members facing those challenges at end of life.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319770">The Supreme Court of Canada ruled unanimously and gave Parliament a timeline to work toward creating legislation. It struck down the laws in Canada as it saw them. Many of those judges were appointed by the previous Conservative government.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319771">What concerns me in what we see before us today is the government, as we often hear, has attempted to strike a balance. It has attempted to seek a perfect middle ground on such a contentious issue. While I admit that is a very difficult thing to do on legislation on an issue like this, we raised a number of concerns at the special committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319772">We continue to raise those concerns, even though the New Democrats support getting this bill to the committee stage so we can hear from those witnesses who now have seen the final legislation. We need to understand whether it is constitutional, whether it is helpful, and whether it will actually achieve what the Supreme Court and Canadians have asked us to do.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319773">I mentioned in the past that it was with regret that after the Supreme Court came down with a very clear directive to Parliament to form a new law, to create new rules for our country, the previous government was unwilling or unable, for whatever reasons, to begin that work at all. We sought to pass a motion in the House of Commons to start the committee process, to bring the witnesses in so we could hear from them, but we were also six to seven months out from an election. The government seemed to not want to really talk about it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319774">The government struck some process that has since not borne any fruit, and now we are under the proverbial legislative gun. We are sitting late. The committee has worked incredibly hard. I want to thank all members, Conservative, Liberal, and New Democrats alike, who worked tirelessly to bring us incredibly important recommendations, some which made it into this bill, some which did not.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319775"> I know the Liberal co-chair of the committee has expressed his disappointment on some of these important issues. Yet, we face this time crunch, somewhat of Parliament's own manufacturing, unfortunately. While the process has been hard worked at, it perhaps will need some revising as the bill moves forward.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319776">Let me take some specific moments and some concerns that we raised. The protection of medical practitioners, while it appears in what is called the preamble of the bill, in the aspirations of the bill, it does not appear in the actual heart of the legislation, it does not appear in the law. For those in the medical services community who have sincere religious, heartfelt beliefs that prevent them from assisting someone with end-of-life procedures, we need to have the most complete protection for those health care professionals.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="50">(1850)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4319777">I come from northern British Columbia. This is an absolutely contentious issue. Faith leaders from a broad set of denominations and those working within the medical profession, who are incredibly dedicated and gifted medical service providers, have come forward with serious concerns. I am not able to allay their concerns with what I see in this legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319778">We helped unanimously pass a motion from the member for <Affiliation DbId="214564" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> to finally have a national palliative care strategy. It is the other side of this coin. While there is the incredibly important issue of what happens at that moment of end of life, for all the moments leading up to that, what kind of care do we offer those who are passing from this life? What kind of honour, respect and love do we offer them through our medical system, through this great Canadian public medical system?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319779"> For so many years, governments have spoken the words. They have said that palliative care is important. They have said that they care for our seniors, for our elders, and for our sick, yet we see nothing for this in budget after budget. We do not see the ability to lift up that burden together and provide that palliative care. In some senses, Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> would be an opportunity to enshrine at least into law the requirement for the country to finally have a national palliative care strategy. It is disappointing that it is only referenced as opposed to being brought in with full weight and structure. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319780">I was also disappointed because the committee worked so hard. As a New Democrat, it is difficult for me to credit a joint Senate House of Commons committee. However, I know those good senators came to this process with an open mind. They worked very diligently and came up with a series of recommendations for the government over a number of the issues, and they were simply ignored.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319781">That brings me to another concern. Legal and medical experts told us that even Ms. Carter would not actually qualify for assistance under this bill. She brought this case to the Supreme Court. She suffered so much. Her family went through hell trying to achieve the services they desired and had to go all the way to the Supreme Court. It finally won that arduous process. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319782">Rather than get that perfect place where the government has sought to balance the competing interests over such a sensitive topic, my concern is that the government has muddled it entirely and invited future challenges in court. We have also heard from some of the lawyers who presented in front of the court. They said that this legislation would be challenged almost immediately. Therefore, what have we just gone through? </ParaText><ParaText id="4319783">The committee met many hours and heard from dozens of witnesses. We looked at the very clear ruling from the Supreme Court. Then we came out the other end with something in the middle that offered neither side any great solace, if there are just two sides in this debate. We have heard from a number of the groups that have worked tirelessly on this issue, for decades in some cases, of their disappointment and dissatisfaction. Happily, the way the process works in our Parliament, the bill can go and be remedied. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319784">This is the true test for the new government. This is its first constitutional legislation. This is the first time it must meet the challenge of the charter in legislation. Will it meet that challenge with the humility, courage, and intelligence that is required to do the right thing, not just the right thing by the courts, but the right thing by Canadians who are desperately seeking the ability to end their life on their terms when they are suffering so greatly? For us, to stand in judgment of them and their families, for us to say we will decree, under more and more narrow definitions, who can actually access this service seems dangerous to me. It seems hubris and unintelligent. This is simply because we invite years more of litigation in the courts and years more of uncertainty and suffering by those very families that are already suffering with a family member whose life is coming to an end in such terrible conditions.</ParaText>

This decision required the government to revisit Canada's long-standing prohibition against euthanasia and assisted suicide.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319800">Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> came about as a response to the Supreme Court ruling on the Carter case. The Carter case determined that persons who satisfy the following criterion of being a competent adult, suffering intolerably from a grievous and irremediable condition, and able to give their clear consent, have a right under section 7 of the charter to physician-assisted dying, or PAD.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319801">Since that decision, the government appointed a Special Joint Committee on Physician-Assisted Dying to make recommendations on a legislative response. Liberal and NDP members in the main report for the special joint committee recommended a very permissive physician-assisted death regime beyond the parameters set aside by the Carter case. Their original report included provisions that suggested that physician-assisted death be available to persons with terminal and non-terminal illnesses, and to persons with physical and psychological conditions. What was most concerning, however, was the suggestion that the government would, in the future, study issues related to physician-assisted death for minors.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319802">The recommendations and provisions suggested by the original report would set Canada on a very treacherous path. In response to these concerns, my Conservative colleagues released a dissenting report, which reined in some of the worrying suggestions and put forward a framework that more closely reflects the Carter decision. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319803">In the dissenting report, my colleagues raised key issues that the legislation could tackle, which included limiting physician-assisted death to competent adults 18 or over; safeguards for vulnerable persons, including a provision for a psychiatric assessment; no advance directives; and conscience protections for physicians. Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> has adopted some of these key provisions from my colleagues' dissenting report.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319804">The main safeguards in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> include limiting euthanasia and assisted suicide to physical illnesses only, and putting in place an age restriction for such procedures. For those individuals who fall under the criteria for PAD, there is no specific referral to a psychiatrist in order to determine whether there are underlying mental illness issues that would compromise their capacity to give an informed consent.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319805">Letters have been pouring in from communities in my riding. I did promise my constituents that I would listen and study all of the important points that have been raised. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319806">This situation has pit the gravely ill against their own family's moral positions, and I too have been touched by the many stories that I have heard. Departed friends and family members had spoken to me in the past about allowing for a merciful end to their suffering, a position that many of us may find ourselves in when our time has come.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319807">However, I am concerned that amendments may be introduced in committee to make the current legislative framework more permissive, or that an opening is presented for regulation to allow for the same permissiveness later on. This concern does not come from thin air, but rather from the very study penned by the special joint committee. Perhaps there could be amendments that would spell out a more restrictive legal framework so that we could effectively ensure that the safeguards are there to always protect the most vulnerable. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319808">Canadian families on all sides of this debate are left anxious as to what lies ahead when the bill moves forward. The Carter case has forced Canadians to come to terms with this difficult decision. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319809">I want to reiterate what my Conservative colleagues have been saying in the weeks leading up to this debate: our priority as parliamentarians should be to ensure that any new legislation developed conforms strictly to the Supreme Court decision, nothing more and nothing less.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="05">(1905)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4319810">Most Canadians want to see the government focus on improving palliative care, as it is an integral part of end-of-life care. There was unanimous agreement from the special joint committee and stakeholders, including the CMA, on the need for a pan-Canadian strategy on palliative care with dedicated funding. If it were up to Canadians, a national strategy on palliative care would be priority number one.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319811">The conscience rights of health care professionals should also be taken into consideration. For some, physician-assisted death is against their moral code. It would be unjust to force a medical professional to act against their convictions. The oath to do no harm is founded in our commitment to look after one another and to care for our most vulnerable through viable medical interventions that honour the sanctity of life. There are many physicians and other health care providers that have raised this issue both with their members of Parliament and at committee. We parliamentarians need to address this for their sake. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319812">There are harsh lessons to be learned from past experiences of jurisdictions such as Belgium. After legalizing euthanasia, deaths from such interventions increased every year. Safeguards were allowed to be removed and euthanasia is now available to individuals who are experiencing mental distress. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319813">One of the most troubling instances of this slippery slope was when the Belgian parliament approved a bill that removed the age restriction from physician-assisted death, a provision actually recommended by our special joint committee report. This PAD extension to minors was not included in the original legislation passed by Belgium years before either.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319814">The slippery slope is a real social phenomenon. We cannot allow Canada to go down that path. We cannot allow any legislation on physician-assisted death to be permissive. Provisions must be restrictive as the Carter case dictates it to be. Canadians expect us to be steadfast in delivering a fair and clear legislation, but we have to avoid expediting any circumstances that would lead to fewer safeguards. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319815"> I urge my colleagues to learn from these harsh realities and lessons. While it has become imperative that the House pass legislation before June 6, it is equally important to make sure that we have an effective piece of legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319816">It is also true that not having a legislative framework to address physician-assisted death is equally irresponsible. Without a comprehensive legislative framework, Canada would consist of a patchwork of provincial protocols that would create other serious concerns.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319817"> We must also remember to be realistic. Even with safeguards, consent can be coerced and vulnerable individuals will never be without risk. In Belgium, there are cases where physician-assisted death was administered without explicit consent; it could very well happen here. Life and death decisions should never come easily, nor should it come from anyone other than oneself . </ParaText><ParaText id="4319818">Life is truly a gift and we must treat it as such. Providing care should always be the priority, and I hope that a pan-Canadian strategy on end-of-life care is also unveiled. This legislation as it is does not carry sufficient provisions and safeguards. We can do better. We owe it to our constituents to do better.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319819"> I hope that if the bill is sent to committee, parliamentarians will have the chance to amend it further to include improved safeguards. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319820">In closing, I would like to pay tribute to friends and family I have lost along the way. My mother and father, Verna and Herman Dreeshen, in life taught me and others so much about compassion and kindness. My parents also showed so much during their final days about strength of character, faith, and the realities of life. Of course, they are both dearly missed.

It is not just an important issue but a difficult issue. In fact, it is a real constellation of difficult issues and difficult decisions. It is an issue that has been a concern in Canada for decades, including the case of Sue Rodriguez more than 20 years ago. We are talking of it again because of the landmark Carter decision that has instructed Parliament to create legislation to legalize and regulate medically assisted dying.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319909">Like all members of the House, I have received many letters, emails, phone calls, and personal representations from all sides of the issue. Some people are concerned that because of the restrictions in the legislation they would not be eligible for the procedure should they need it in the future; while others are worried that medical practitioners who have ethical concerns would not be able to opt out if they wish. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319910">Obviously we need good legislation that clearly spells out the eligibility criteria for this procedure as well as the regulations around the actual procedure itself. Because of these needs, I am generally in favour of this legislation, but I feel that it is deficient in several regards.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319911"> We have to ensure that this bill properly addresses the Supreme Court decision. The last thing we need is to prolong the suffering of grievously ill people through more litigation. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319912">As I mentioned, we also need to ensure that the practitioners who are undertaking these procedures are protected regarding their roles and moral beliefs. Last week in the House, I tabled a petition from many of my constituents on this issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319913">We need to ensure that people with progressive illnesses have access to suitable palliative care, as many people have mentioned here this evening. They need access to palliative care, pain management, and home care so that medically assisted dying is not set out simply because other more appropriate actions are not available.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319914">Finally, we need to ensure that this procedure is equally available across the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319915"> The need for this procedure is clear as was laid out in the Supreme Court decision. One of my constituents has already requested legal access to the procedure, several months ago, without waiting for our action here as his suffering was so great. He waited through the foot-dragging of the previous government, but could wait no longer. Clearly, other Canadians who are suffering through intolerable pain and discomfort will continue to access this service through more complicated legal channels if we do not pass legislation here.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319916">Just last Friday, I met with another constituent who is suffering with advanced progressive multiple sclerosis. He wanted to talk first about federal funding for research into experimental treatments for MS. Because of the advanced nature of his disease he was not able to access the present experimental treatments, but he desperately wanted others to have greater access in the future. However, now that he cannot dress himself, bathe himself, or even shave his face, he feels that life with any dignity is fast slipping away. He is deeply concerned that he would not be eligible for medically assisted dying because his natural death may be years away and not “reasonably foreseeable” as this bill now states. Many experts feel that even Kay Carter, who brought the case before the Supreme Court, would not be eligible for medically assisted dying under the criteria now set out in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319917">The same constituent also recounted how difficult life is for his wife as he faces his progressive illness. He would like better access to home care services and later palliative care, so that his wife can have respite from his daily care. However, these services are not available equally across Canada. We desperately need a national palliative care strategy and the funding that goes with it to ensure that patients who need this care have access to it. Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> refers to palliative care in its preamble, but it is silent after that. The government was silent on palliative care in the budget, despite a promise for $3 billion for home care in the election campaign.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="50">(1950)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4319918">Hospice care is also needed across this country, but it is even less available than hospital palliative care. In my riding, there is only one hospice centre and it is five hours by road from the east side of the riding. I have met with an active hospice society on the eastern edge of the riding, but it is struggling to find funding for a hospice, despite a clear need for it and a strong case that it will save a considerable amount of money in the local health care system. This disparate amount of care is a concern to me, since we do not want people choosing medically assisted dying simply because they do not have access to proper pain management, palliative care, home care, or hospice treatment. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319919">Finally, I would like to talk about advance directives. Many people with progressive diseases would like to provide their loved ones and physicians clear instructions regarding their fate if they become incapable of giving those instructions at a later date because of their deteriorating physical condition. The special joint committee that studied this issue made a recommendation to allow advance directives regarding medically assisted dying under certain conditions, but this recommendation is not included in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. Certainly advance directives must be crystal clear if they are to be used, but it is an issue that we must face.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319920">To conclude, I feel that the eligibility criteria put forth in this bill may not reflect the Supreme Court ruling that brought us to this point. While we have to be careful to protect the most vulnerable in our society, many Canadians, including the constituent I mentioned at the start, will suffer even more than they are now if we get this wrong. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319921">I know that this debate will continue at committee and I hope some of the concerns I and others have raised will be addressed in the few weeks remaining before the June 6 deadline.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Certainly the <Affiliation DbId="214321" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> faces a very daunting one. It is clear that Canadians have varied beliefs and deeply held convictions when it comes to the issue that is before the House today. I appreciate that the justice minister has attempted to find a law that balances the autonomy of individuals and the rights and responsibilities of the Canadian community as a whole, while simultaneously protecting the vulnerable among us.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319975">It has been said that a society can be judged by how it treats its weakest members. I believe that is true.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319976">I have to confess that I have wrestled with this legislation and continue to do so today. It seems as though the Supreme Court of Canada, with the Carter decision, has forced us into an unending abyss of grey. I prefer clear lines. I like black and white wherever possible.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319977">I believe that doctors exist to save lives, not take them, and I believe that we as a society should always contend for life and not against it. However, the Supreme Court of Canada has ruled otherwise, and thereby robbed Canadians of clarity when it comes to this issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319978">Assisted dying is now permitted in Canada, and we as parliamentarians have been tasked with the responsibility of putting legislation in place.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319979">To that end, I would like to take a few minutes to share with the House and with the Canadian public my reflections on the proposed legislation. In particular, I would like to explore whether or not the rules and regulations within this legislation are adequate to protect the most vulnerable Canadians among us from being encouraged or pressured into pursuing assisted dying.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319980">To be clear, this legislation is far better than what was recommended by the special joint committee, but there are still a number of things that cause me concern.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319981">The first is a lack of access to quality palliative care within the nation of Canada. Right now, only 30% of Canadians have access to palliative care. Without access to all end-of-life options, a person cannot make a fully informed decision with regard to how they will face their death. Palliative care affirms that fighting to preserve life is our natural instinct and that dying is a part of our natural human experience.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319982">Palliative care empowers a person to come to the end of his or her life with dignity intact and in a state of comfort. It deeply concerns me that we as a society are willing to invest significant dollars into assisted death before allocating adequate funds for palliative care. Why are we shifting to placing greater emphasis on death than on life?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319983">Furthermore, I am concerned about those who acquire a disability during their life. In my role as the critic for persons with disabilities, I was able to consult with many organizations from across the country as well as organizations within my local constituency, and with a broad number of individuals who currently suffer from a disability. These personal stories helped to shape the concerns that I hold and will deliver today.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319984">Without exception, every person who acquired a disability in their life told me that they experienced a period of intense depression as they adjusted to their new reality. For some, this period lasted days, and for others it lasted years. However, the hope they shared with me was that despite how different their life looked after they adjusted to their disability, they did regain purpose, joy, and dignity.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319985">All of these individuals continue to face significant daily challenges. Quite a few of them rely on others for basic needs, such as eating or personal hygiene, and many even live with chronic pain. However, all of them have come to value the life that they lead and live with dignity, honour, and respect.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319986">The message that these individuals brought forward to me was that in their previous lives they did not have a clue with regard to how it was possible to live with purpose and dignity while having a disability. This attitude took a while to discover, and they did so within the circumstances of their condition.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319987">This is why I was pleased to see that the justice minister held her ground and did not allow for advance consent. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319988">The Supreme Court, in many previous decisions, has defined the concept of continuous consent. We often hear about this in relation to sexual assault trials, but the principle is active in this case as well. Both the trial judge and the Supreme Court specifically limited assisted dying to a competent adult person who clearly consents to the termination of life. This consent needs to be given throughout the entire procedure. A previous declaration cannot fully appreciate how a person's understanding of his or her own condition changes as he or she learns to adapt to the new reality. Simply trusting someone's preconceived concept of what they will be like in the future is not a reliable mechanism for determining how they will actually be with their future condition.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="15">(2015)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4319989">I appreciated the reference from the minister to the need to protect vulnerable persons. The Supreme Court rightly found that the intent of the previous Criminal Code provisions was to protect vulnerable people from being induced to suicide. The Supreme Court validated this intent with its Carter decision. The unfortunate reality of people with disabilities and those with degenerative conditions is all too often one of poverty. In this circumstance, these individuals are entirely reliant on community access initiatives in order to live lives of dignity.</ParaText><ParaText id="4319990">I have heard tragic stories of individuals who, with minimal community supports, such as adequate home care or assistance in transportation, could easily live a dignified existence. However, because these individuals were left in isolation and vulnerability, they wanted to access assisted suicide. They wanted to end the suffering that had nothing to do with their condition and everything to do with their social vulnerabilities. This is the harsh reality. Without strong safeguards in place, vulnerable people could be influenced to accept assisted dying because of non-medical social circumstances.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319991"> For this reason, all of the major organizations I have talked with from across Canada that work with persons with disabilities have called for a prior review by an expert to assess non-medical social vulnerabilities. This is not currently part of the legislation that is proposed. Something that I believe is absolutely essential to any legislative framework as we go forward is to have a prior review by someone with the expertise to determine if isolation, depression, burden, or poverty are impairing the ability of someone to make a competent decision with regard to assisted dying. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319992">I commend the Liberal government for reintroducing into this debate the concept that physician-assisted dying must be connected with a condition that would lead to death. I appreciate this provision. As an alternate member of the Special Joint Committee on Physician-Assisted Dying, I saw a number of members of that committee from both the House of Commons and the other place argue that assisted dying should be offered to any individual who felt he or she was experiencing “enduring suffering that is intolerable to the individual in the circumstances of his or her condition.”</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319993">The emphasis was on the perceived experience of the individual rather than a physical condition. There is no science to this approach, and no external diagnosis. If followed to its logical conclusion, this so-called criteria would allow anyone to access assisted dying without any accountability whatsoever. However, by tying assisted dying to an external medical diagnosis, it would move this process to something beyond the relative experience of the individual. This is critical to lessening the slippery slope that would inevitably exist with this legislation in place.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319994">Every student who has taken an introductory class in politics would be familiar with the concept that laws are a social contract within Canada. When a law is struck down, it means that by extension every Canadian is in part affirming a previously banned behaviour that is now legal. It may not seem like a big distinction to limit assisted dying to conditions that reasonably could be expected to cause death, but it will in fact make a significant difference in the society we build going forward. </ParaText><ParaText id="4319995">If we are a compassionate society that believes in protecting the vulnerable, it means that we believe society has the ability to overrule the impulses of the individual when we determine that those impulses would cause harm to the individual or harm to another person. This motive to save others is one of our redeeming characteristics as human beings. To allow this procedure to be accessed based on the subjective experience of individuals who feel they are in pain from a non-terminal condition would fundamentally alter the social fabric of our society. We are a society that contends for life. We must remain as that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4319996">We as a Canadian society need to ensure that we do not tell those living with a disability, those who have to rely on others for the necessities of life, and those who face chronic pain with courage and determination, that their lives are not worth living. It is easy to lose sight of the broader implications to society when one focuses only on the post-modern concept of relative truth. Such an approach makes it impossible to argue with a suicidal person that his or her life is worth living. However, when we affirm objective truth, that is truth that remains true. Whether an individual believes it or not, it is so because we as a society have chosen to believe it.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

In the 1991 Rodriguez decision, which upheld the prohibition against assisted suicide, the term “assisted suicide” was used 92 times. However, in the 2015 Carter decision, in which the Court came to an opposite conclusion, the term “assisted suicide” was used only 23 times, while the term “assisted death” was used 24 times.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320018"> When we look at the current legislation before us, we see that the term “assisted suicide” does not appear at all, the term “suicide” appears only seven times, and the phrase “medical assistance in dying” is used 72 times.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320019">In 20 years, we have progressed from recognizing the value and dignity of life and making every effort to discourage people from suicide, to now offering assisted suicide as a form of health care and calling it “medical assistance in dying.” </ParaText><ParaText id="4320020">While I find many parts of Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> alarming, I want to start with this shift in the language. It is misleading to use “medical assistance in dying” in the context in which this bill does. Medical assistance in dying is not helping people choose to end their lives. Medical assistance in dying is what the medical community calls palliative care or hospice care.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320021"> As Canadians, we are blessed to live in a country that has a great health care system, with many physicians who care deeply about helping their patients live fulfilling and healthy lives. When circumstances change and patients are facing an incurable deadly disease, these same doctors use their medical knowledge to relieve pain and suffering through end-of-life care. This is real medical assistance in death.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320022"> That is why I believe amendments are necessary to correct the hijacking of real health care. First, Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> should be amended to replace “medical assistance in dying” with simply “assistance in dying”. This would separate assisted suicide from health care.</ParaText>

This would eliminate the requirement of the medical community to be involved, as well as any concerns around the conscience rights of doctors. Licensed individuals, including doctors who wish to participate, could assist in the assisted suicide process and allow our health system to remain focused on its primary objective of providing health care to all Canadians.</ParaText>

In the outline of the legislation provided by the government, there is a definition of “medical assistance in dying”. I believe that using this particular term is important. It is important for Canadians, when it comes time to make this choice, that the word “suicide” is not attached to it, because it is a choice they are making at a time in their lives when they are in great distress and pain.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320051">I do want to highlight for the member that there are two definitions. The first one is the administration of a substance by a medical practitioner or authorized nurse practitioner that causes a person's death and the second is the one he has been referring to, which is the prescription or provision of the substance that the person then self-administers. There are two separate pieces and that is why “medical assistance in dying” has come forward.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320052">He also mentioned the medical community.

The debate we are having today and will continue to have in the coming days and weeks is an important one. We need to find a solution before the deadline that the Supreme Court of Canada gave us. We got an extension so that we could get the job done in a limited period of time.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320062">I would like to review the reasons why we are debating this issue. I think it is important to put the debate in context. We are having this debate tonight because of a Supreme Court of Canada ruling that directed Parliament to consider the matter and propose a legislative solution.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320063">In its decision, the Supreme Court of Canada clearly struck down two Criminal Code provisions. Now it is up to us, as responsible parliamentarians, to fill the legal void that will take effect on June 6, 2016. This discussion predates the Supreme Court of Canada's decision. Rulings by lower courts led to the Supreme Court of Canada's final ruling. That is why we are here to talk about this.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320064">It started when Ms. Carter, who is familiar to us all, and a number of other people went to the B.C. Supreme Court because they wanted the Criminal Code provisions that, until now, prevented people from aiding someone to take their own life struck down. That is what started the debate, and it ended with the Supreme Court of Canada ruling.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320065">I would like to read a few excerpts from the ruling that indicate what our mandate as parliamentarians is. The Carter decision is historic. The first aspect that makes this decision historic is that the Supreme Court of Canada recognized that the B.C. court had the right to rule against the jurisprudence from the Rodriguez case. The trial judge decided to change the jurisprudence, because her ruling contradicted the ruling from a previous case. The trial judge's ruling also contradicted a Supreme Court of Canada ruling. Frankly, that was one of the important topics of discussion that came from this court case. Did the judge have the right to reverse the jurisprudence that had been valid until that point? It is a contentious issue. The fact that the Supreme Court of Canada validated the interpretation of the trial judge was historic. The changes that have taken place in the social context, in our society, are what allowed her to change the jurisprudence. The Supreme Court of Canada upheld the decision. It was also historic because it recognized that the right to life also includes the right to end one's life. It was the first time we had such an interpretation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320066">I will now quote an excerpt from the Supreme Court of Canada decision:</ParaText>

I agreed with this interpretation, but I have to admit that, reading it for the first time, it was a surprise. That is why my colleague spoke about irony. Nevertheless, it is quite true that the right to life also includes the right to dispose of it.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320071">I remember very well the moment when the decision was handed down on February 6, 2015. It was a Friday afternoon and I was in my riding office. The first thing I did was read the document. I was very interested in constitutional law, but also in this timely topic and the societal debate.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320072">Quebec had a similar debate over the course of several years.

I was especially intrigued by the mandate given to us in its decision, namely to draft new legislation so that the right recognized by the Supreme Court would be granted to Canadians.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320073">However, I was disappointed that the discussion did not get underway in the ensuing days. I was expecting it to happen quickly, but there were delays. I do not understand why, because it was a historic and unanimous Supreme Court decision. This decision directly involved parliamentarians, but it took a long time before things were put in place. We spoke out against that.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320074">True, some work was done by experts. However, once again, it took too long. It is important to point out this foot-dragging. As a parliamentarian, I was disappointed that it was not the first item on the government's agenda when we returned to this place. The government quite simply did not want to talk about it. Yes, it did appoint a panel, but it quite simply refused to talk about the issue. I found that deplorable.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320075">Now we are faced with a fait accompli, if I can put it that way. The Supreme Court decision requires us to make this service accessible because it is a constitutional right. As responsible parliamentarians, we cannot stand idly by. The Supreme Court gave us the mandate to ensure that this new constitutional right is accessible and given to Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320076">As parliamentarians, we cannot just say that this is a constitutional right that every Canadian is entitled to and then turn around and restrict access to this service as much as possible. We should do the opposite. </ParaText><ParaText id="4320077">It is important to understand the essence of the Supreme Court decision, that the right to medical assistance in dying is a constitutional right protected under the charter. As parliamentarians, we have no reason not to make this service accessible to everyone. I urge all my colleagues to support this bill in order to send it to committee and possibly improve it, so as to ensure that it respects the Supreme Court decision.</ParaText>

It has lent itself to thoughtful consideration of what is a very challenging bill because it is a challenging issue. I have found listening to the debate helpful in terms of coming to some conclusions about this bill and about the wider issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320095">We have heard a number of members refer to their personal experience, which is natural to do with issues like this. My own is somewhat inconclusive. I have had several people whom I have been close to go through longer dying processes where it was clear for a while that they were in decline and were not going to get better and were suffering severely. I would say that for me, the lessons coming out of some of those different experiences mitigate in different directions on this.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320096"> In some cases, I have seen situations that really exposed the value of making medical assistance in dying possible because of the great suffering of people who know that death is coming and would rather die with dignity and choose the circumstances of their death and be able to die surrounded by their family, and having said their good-byes. I have also seen situations that really emphasize the vulnerability of people who are in hospital and unable to advocate for themselves, and how important it is in those situations to have family members who can do that for them. As well, I have seen how important it is to have rules, especially in the case where medical assistance in dying is available, to ensure that people are not taken advantage of in that vulnerable state.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320097">I have also seen in those cases, and in one in particular, the fact that even prior to the Supreme Court decision, decisions about death and dying were already being made in Canadian hospitals and there were conversations already being had by families. Right now or prior to the Supreme Court decision, those conversations were about when to stop providing treatment or when to begin starving someone, frankly, who is in hospital. It is important to note that the conversation was already happening prior to the decision. Now that the decision has been made, this conversation is going to happen in new ways regardless of the decision that is taken here, because the Supreme Court has said that medical assistance in dying is something that is going to be available to Canadians. What we are here to decide is the framework under which that is provided and the rules according to which that is provided. We really cannot stress that enough.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320098">There are two distinct sets of considerations, as far as I am concerned, that would lend themselves to making a decision on this bill. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320099">One set is what we could call the substantive considerations about what exactly those rules should be. When we try to set those, it is helpful to have an expression of the ultimate values that we want to see manifest in the legislation. I was searching for the words and, as it turns out, quite fittingly, in a submission to the Special Joint Committee on Physician-Assisted Dying by the moderator of the United Church, which is my church, I found that language. The submission incidentally was not a position statement by the United Church. There was at that time and, as far as I know, there is still no official position by the United Church. However, the moderator made the submission and quoted a former moderator of the United Church who said:</ParaText><ParaText id="4320100"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">For Christians, life is a sacred gift from God and needs to be valued and protected.

God is love, and the Christian affirmation is that God’s love is the only absolute. “In life, in death, in life beyond death, God is with us,” says our creed. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4320101"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">So the United Church’s theological tradition is not to suggest that believing in the sanctity of life means that any attempt to end life must be prevented. Instead, what we are called to do is first listen to the struggles of those who are facing hard decisions and to make sure that they are not alone in those decisions, and second, to trust people with difficult choices about their own lives.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="05">(2105)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4320102">I cannot help but agree that the best decision we can make and the best policy we can implement is one that empowers people to make those decisions in their own lives and to ensure they are not alone in doing that, that it is not something they cannot consult their family or their medical professionals about and have a conversation about the right way to go about making the kind of decision that they may well be inclined to make anyway. We have heard some of the stories of terrible suffering and incidents that occur when people are denied the right to do what they intend to do with their own life.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320103">It should not be a policy that causes people to make those decisions because other services were inadequately available or because they were under undue pressure from family or medical professionals. The safeguards in the bill actually do a fairly good job of ensuring that people will not be subject to that kind of coercion.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320104"> I worry that the lack of provision for any kind of advance directive may put people in difficult situations where they are not able to have that conversation and where it may possibly lead either to premature death because they choose to do it while they still can or to prolong a needless suffering. I would support a cautious movement toward a limited form of advance directive, because I recognize that it is a thorny issue, and it is not obvious the best way to do that, and I think it opens up a can of worms.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320105">I agree with the cautious spirit of the bill with respect to extending this decision to minors.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320106"> I share the concern expressed by others in this House that there is no protection for the right of conscientious objection for health professionals who do not want to engage in this practice. I would hope to see amendments to this bill at committee to bring that in.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320107">The second set of considerations that I think are very important for us in this place as legislators is to recognize that no matter what Parliament does here, medical assistance in dying will be available. That is not a decision we are making here. That is a decision that has been made in the Supreme Court. We are here to talk about the conditions under which that service will be provided. It is crucial that the rules be the same across the country, that we have a federal framework that applies across the board, and that it does not become a hodgepodge of various regulations from province to province to province.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320108">It is important that we give certainty to medical professionals who will inevitably be called upon to assist in certain deaths, that they know that their career will not be on the line or they will not be risking going to jail if they go ahead and engage in this. That is why it is important to make amendments to the Criminal Code to give them that certainty, and this is the place to do that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320109">It is important as legislators that we also strive to honour the spirit of the Supreme Court decision, and that we head off needless legal challenges. We heard in this place that whatever happens, there will be challenges. However, I think there are some obvious ones. Adding language that was not in the Supreme Court decision, like the language of a “natural foreseeable death”, would preclude one of the very same women who pursued the right to medical assistance in dying in the Supreme Court. I think it is an obvious basis for challenge. It would be a mistake to send this bill out of this place if the service could not be provided to the person who the Supreme Court determined had a right to it. </ParaText><ParaText id="4320110">In the last few moments that I have for debate, I want to say that those are the considerations that bear on this bill. However, this is happening in Canada no matter what, and we need to make sure that palliative care and other long-term care solutions are available to Canadians so that this is not a first option, a second option, or a third option, but it really is an option that comes after all other reasonable options have been explored, and that people have the support and the resources to access all of those options. </ParaText><ParaText id="4320111">With that said, I will put on the record that I will be voting for this bill at second reading, and those are my reasons why.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

However, what I would say matters greatly, what matters in this place is if we are going to do that, we need to see federal leadership. That has been the problem with health care in Canada for decades now. There has been a total absence of leadership from the federal government.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320118">We have heard members talk about introducing palliative care into the Canada Health Act. That is fine, except we cannot enforce the Canada Health Act unless we have a federal government that is actually funding health care in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320119">We have seen the contribution of the federal government over the decades go from 50¢ on the dollar down to 17¢ in health care. It was projected to go lower under the Conservative plan. We have yet to see in the Liberal budget anything that would stop that reduction in the federal share of health care funding.</ParaText>

I do not know if we will agree quite as much on this issue as we did on the Air Canada Participation Act, but I always appreciate his contribution.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320122">The member talked about the issue of autonomy. I would like to raise the issue in the context of the social architecture of choice, the factors that are around individuals that may shape a choice such that the choices they end up making are not the ones they would want to make under ideal circumstances.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320123">Specifically, if we are going to genuinely protect autonomy in this case, I believe we need to have a strong system of palliative care. We need to have an advanced legal review to ensure the criteria are actually met, that a person is not being pushed into this, and someone is checking that the criteria are met. We also need some clarity that prevents people from shopping doctor to doctor with ambiguous criteria where there are vastly different interpretations.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320124">Would the member agree with me that these proposals are not things that limit individual choice, but rather they are things that protect an individual's choice to get what they want and not be forced into something that is not really what they are seeking at the end of the day?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

That is not a true expression of autonomy, and it is important to provide that.

In my 10 years here, this has likely been one of the most sensitive, most compassionate and emotional discussions I have had with my constituents in Lambton—Kent—Middlesex. </ParaText><ParaText id="4320128">Let me start with a little background. Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> is act to amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted dying, so we can allow someone under the law to kill someone else. It sort of catches me in the pit of my stomach, quite honestly. Section 241 of the Criminal Code talks about counselling or aiding suicide. It says:</ParaText><ParaText id="4320129"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Everyone who</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4320130"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2"> a. counsels a person to commit suicide, or</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4320131"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2"> b. aids or abets a person to commit suicide,</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4320131"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2"> whether suicide ensues or not, is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4320133">That is what Canada has been built upon in terms of the desire to not have people help people kill themselves.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320134">In February of last year, the Supreme Court of Canada gave all the exemptions to this Criminal Code. The Criminal Code now gives an exemption for medical assistance in dying, so no medical practitioner or nurse practitioner can be charged. There is an exemption for people aiding the practitioner. If the doctor is doing it, and a nurse practitioner is helping, they are exempt from any charges.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320135"> The pharmacist who provides the cocktail, whether injected by the doctor or prepared so the patient injects it on his or her own, is exempt from any criminal charge.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320136">There is an exemption now for a person aiding a patient. No person commits an offence if he or she does anything at another person's explicit request.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320137">The coverall is that if there is a mistake made, no charges can come forward.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320138">I find it quite extraordinary that with the stroke of a pen, nine judges made a decision to take a criminal law in the country and turn it 180 degrees, now make something that was criminal a health remedy. We now have to encourage people to take someone else's life.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320139">I find it quite hypocritical that we are talking about assisted suicide, assisted death at this time. We like to use comforting words so it does not really mean we are actually giving someone the authority to kill someone else, but that is what we are doing. That is what the Supreme Court told us we have to do. At the same time, we have a national strategy on suicide prevention.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="20">(2120)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4320140">I am not sure where the government is on that discussion at this time, but I find the two of them are running in opposite directions. When my colleagues talked about first nations, we have all read about the issues. We are all up in arms and disturbed when we see not only individuals but groups coming together to commit suicide.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320141">One of the key things in any the long term care is palliative care. We have heard this from just about everyone. Many of us have talked about our experiences or someone we know. I can also speak of that. </ParaText><ParaText id="4320142">My parents died of cancer. Anyone who knows someone who has had bone cancer knows of the pain that comes with it. Maybe back then though, when my parents were suffering and succumbed to cancer, there was true palliative care. In their cases it never crossed their minds to ask for some sort of assistance to terminate their lives, let alone ask to have their doctor either provide or give them the solution to take their lives. </ParaText><ParaText id="4320143">We talk a lot about palliative care, where it is and how it will be funded. We have the governing party saying that it is in the budget. The member from Winnipeg said it was in the budget. It has not been produced. We know it is not in the budget. If we read the preamble, we might read between the lines, if one has a visionary mind that there might be money for it. There just is not. It is not in the legislation. It is not in the budget. I am afraid it is a lone wolf out in the desert saying it. </ParaText><ParaText id="4320144">We need to take some lessons from other countries, like Belgium and the Netherlands. Belgium started this 15 years ago. It was very secure so patients did not get on a slippery slope. However, now it is estimated that 32% of those patients never gave their consent for their euthanasia. We are told it now increases by about 47% per year. </ParaText><ParaText id="4320145">As palliative care dollars drop, the desire to have something to take the pain away, which palliative care could look after, goes to assisted suicide. </ParaText><ParaText id="4320146">I have some serious concerns about this. I talked about palliative care. I also do not see where there is any protection for doctors, nurses, nurse practitioners. Nor is there protection for institutions that have a moral conscience, an ethical bar that will not allow them. I have talked to doctors and nurses. A nurse had asked me if this was true. I said we would have to wait for the legislation. She said that if it were true. she would be out of it. She could not kill someone or be part of the euthanization of someone. A doctor who took an oath to protect lives said that he never took any oath to take away life. </ParaText><ParaText id="4320147">Does the government have a vision in the future?

							<ParaText id="4320168">All of us, as Canadian MPs, have the opportunity to have a close relationship with our constituents thanks to the many means of communication available. It is always a great privilege and a sign of undeniable trust to listen to heartfelt confidences.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320169">I observed great resiliency but, at the same time, great concern about the bill. I use the term “resiliency” because, in Quebec, the debate was held over a long period of time and my constituents accepted the voice of the majority of the Quebec National Assembly, even though the decision was not unanimous.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320170">The concern was caused by the version of the bill, which provides a broader interpretation than what Quebeckers had said they wanted. I hope that the final version of the bill will allay these concerns, if not completely eliminate them.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320171">What was surprising was that the discussions I had with my constituents all led to another very important issue, palliative care. Unfortunately, not all Canadians have access to palliative care and that is the problem. Why not focus on life and on living with dignity, as was suggested by Sauveur Champagne, one of my constituents, and on the quality of our lives in our last days? Appropriate care could have prevented this debate. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320172">There is medical comfort care and ethically provided adequate support that, unfortunately, not everyone can access for different reasons.

It is human nature to enjoy the best that life has to offer.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320173">I believe that Canadians are aware that life is very fragile and that we all have the opportunity to share love and friendship, to strengthen bonds and to help one another while we can.</ParaText>

This will leave scars on our society if it is not properly regulated and accepted, given that part of our population does not support this bill, since it goes against their fundamental, cultural, and religious beliefs.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320176">With all due respect, we must consider the views of that segment of the population, which is just as important, because they are also entitled to have a say in this Parliament. Others, on a more personal level, are going through the process of losing of a child or parent right now, and they could, to various degrees, change their views on the act of choosing to end one's life.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320177">That being said, ultimately, the decision to end one's life is up to the individual, based on his or her convictions, beliefs, and physical condition. I hope it remains a personal choice that is respected by all family, friends, and loved ones, a choice that is not influenced by any external pressures.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320178">The question we need to ask is this: how can we be sure that this will not get out of control? It will be difficult to include safeguards in the law that will cover all of the very different individual cases. That is why many of us already feel as though this law will not be perfect; it will merely be acceptable. As medical advances allow people to live longer, what will be the appropriate degree of dignity, for those who have to decide?</ParaText><ParaText id="4320179">For those who want to enjoy more precious moments, this may represent a tremendous opportunity to prolong their lives. For the others, the door will now be open to allow them to make a new choice, which also seems to bring hope to those who no longer want to count the days.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320180">Personally, I have would have liked to wait and do what Quebec did, to take five years to assess the impact of this type of end-of-life option. Taking that amount of time to conduct a comprehensive study would help us, as legislators, make a more informed decision. I think that would be the wise thing to do in order to make the right choices for the safety of Canadians and future generations. However, that is not going to happen, since we are obligated to make such a quick decision. In my opinion, there will always be some doubt since the law will be merely acceptable. Time will tell whether this change in direction was a good one. May God help us.</ParaText>

We will live with this new law. We have to ensure that it will be interpreted in accordance with our guidelines.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320183">In closing, the best way for people to figure out where they stand on this issue is for all Canadians to experience the end of life alongside someone who is dying.

The issue of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide has been debated in Canada for a number of years. However, a resolution for this sensitive issue became critical since the decision of Carter v. Canada, which unanimously struck down the Criminal Code ban on assisted dying, and gave Parliament a year to come up with new legislation. </ParaText>

Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> seeks to fulfill section 7 of the charter, namely the right to life, liberty, and security. The bill proposes a wide and detailed range of legislated objectives, legal notions, patient eligibility criteria, exemptions from the criminal liability, and safeguards. However, as experience shows, the question of life and death is very vague. An absolute prohibition of assisted dying forces Canadians who have grievous and irreversible medical conditions to suffer and look for medical assistance abroad to end their lives.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320208">There have been two cases in Canada: Rodriguez, and Carter v.

The reason could be debated for days, but like all living things we strive to live by adapting to our environment. From bugs to humans, we adapt to survive, to live.

My wife, like myself, believed in fighting to the bitter end. I watched my wife battle cancer for two years.

Some of my comments may be new to this debate and some will echo those of others before me. However, they are all the voice of my constituents in Calgary Confederation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320238">As my constituent Brenda Robinson said to me in a letter, “There is no doubt that we are in a defining moment for our nation on this important issue. So many lives hang in the balance of how our leaders craft this legislation.”</ParaText><ParaText id="4320239">As I said, there are many sides to this complex issue. The people watching this debate the last couple of days, those people in the galleries, or those watching CPAC on their computers are able to pick and choose the parts of this legislation that they do and do not like, but I and all of us in the House only have the option of a yea or a nay when it comes to a vote. We know that the legislation will pass. It has to pass because the court has said so.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320240">Members may or may not know that I am a big proponent of palliative care. My constituency assistant Lou Winthers in Calgary was the founder and executive director of Hospice Calgary. My late father-in-law was the executive chef at the Rosedale Hospice in Calgary. He spent much of his long life career as an executive chef in many hotels throughout the country. He spent his final years cooking for the dying in the hospice in Calgary. </ParaText><ParaText id="4320241">For many years, my family has volunteered with Hospice Calgary. Never would I have ever thought that I would be fighting for a bed for my wife one day. I saw then first-hand how critical it is that we have a good palliative care system here in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320242">Through my experience with Hospice Calgary, I also saw first-hand how horribly underfunded this specialized care is within our current health care system. We need to improve palliative care both for the patients and their families. I cannot thank the staff enough at Agapé Hospice for the support they gave me and my family only a few years ago. I only wish that all Canadians had the access and support they need to get palliative care during one of the toughest times in one's life. We need to do better, and we can do better, but we have a long way to go.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320243">I have received more correspondence on this issue than any other issue since being elected or during my 10 years as an MLA in Alberta. Normally, we see letters either urging an MP to support or oppose legislation. However, the inevitability of this legislation has resulted in a different kind of response. My constituents are writing to suggest how things can be improved and to express concerns with respect to very specific parts. This has made for some very emotional and thoughtful reading.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320244">Ken, a constituent in my riding, wrote to me saying, “Even though I am personally against all euthanasia on personal, moral, and faith grounds, I concede [we]  will probably have to have a law that allows it in extreme circumstances. But many of the current recommendations go far beyond, and in effect could allow this to become an ‘on-demand service’ that leaves many of the most vulnerable unprotected.” Ken's letter is one of many that raise concern for our most vulnerable.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320245"> Connie C., another constituent who wrote to me, is passionately against any form of suicide. She said, “My father's death was a gradual decline that spanned a four month period, it was a difficult time for him and for the family. However, we shared some very meaningful time together during those four months and I have a new appreciation for the death process. It was painful and difficult for him, unfortunately struggle is part of the human experience.... Suicide cuts short the human experience and no physician should be asked to end a human life.” That is what Connie had to say.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="05">(2205)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4320246">On the other side of the issue, there are those who wish to have access to these medically assisted options.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320247"> Valerie wrote to me and said, “My father and others in my family have had dementia and I saw how they forgot to bathe and brush their teeth and refused to let others take care of them. My father lived his last 6 months in a nursing bed doing nothing but lay in bed. If I get dementia I know I do not want to live like that. If I do not have the option of physician assisted dying then I will opt to find a way to end my life while I am still able to make this decision. I beg you to please allow me a better option should I get dementia.” </ParaText><ParaText id="4320248"> Debra Lee wrote to me, and she wrote to the <Affiliation DbId="214491" Type="2">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> as well, with a perspective that few have. She worked for over 40 years as a registered nurse. She said, “I saw my share of people die, many of them with good management of their symptoms but some who did suffer a great deal–from physical as well as emotional pain. Some people received intrusive treatments which had no hope of curing them or even easing their suffering. But for too long in my career, I observed a death denying culture–everyone from health providers, family members and individuals themselves having difficulty accepting death.”</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320249">As I stated earlier, this issue is complex.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320250">Another constituent, Catherine G., focused on some of the specific parts of the proposed legislation that she felt needs to be improved. She expressed concerns that there is not enough protection for the vulnerable. She said, “I believe that physician assisted death will leave many elderly people open to the worse form of abuse. They may feel pressured to accept it since they feel themselves to be a burden to their loved ones. We must care for the sick and elderly; doctors must never kill.”</ParaText><ParaText id="4320251">Many expressed concern for the most vulnerable in society, but some also wrote about their own vulnerability.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320252"> Tracey wrote, “Today my mother is slowly starving to death in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's. Since my grandmother also had it, there is a good chance I will as well. Without assisted suicide I will be forced to commit suicide as soon as I am diagnosed because I won't allow my children to go through what I have, nor do I wish to suffer as my mother has.”</ParaText><ParaText id="4320253"> Doug James, another constituent of mine, echoed my sentiments exactly when he said, “I suggest that we are better off having what some will call incomplete legislation, rather than no legislation at all, and trust that future legislation can be passed to address any deficiencies.”</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320254">It is for this reason alone that I will be supporting the bill. It is not about a vote of approval for the bill or the circumstances that brought it about. Rather, it is a vote that recognizes that when it comes to something as personal and sensitive as death, it is better to have options available, even if we do not like them, even if we do not believe in them. It is better to have some legal framework than none at all.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320255">My decision will undoubtedly be welcomed by some and loathed by others, but I am confident that my constituents will look at my past, my experiences, and respect that in the absence of an overwhelming and clear direction from my constituents, I am voting for choice.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320256">In closing, I want to also echo a deep concern expressed by David MacPhail, who wrote to me and said, “There should be clear conscience protections for health care workers and facilities in the legislation.... It is not right that people should be forced to participate against their deeply held convictions, either through referral or by doing the procedure.” He went on to say, “It is not necessary to make dedicated physicians and healthcare workers put their careers on the line and open themselves to professional disciplinary action simply because they wish to follow their conscience...”.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320257">Finally, I want to reiterate my main concern with the dying process, and that is palliative care. I challenge all in this House to approach this issue with as much energy, urgency, and focus as we have seen on this bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320258">I believe that when we all focus on a shared goal, we can achieve remarkable improvements in a very timely fashion.

We are proposing a change in how we provide end-of-life care for Canadians, but it goes beyond that. </ParaText><ParaText id="4320275">If the bill passes, we will give new authority to agents of the state to take someone's life away. That is a sobering responsibility, the one that I hope none of us is taking lightly. What is proposed is a fundamental shift in Canadian society and how we see ourselves as humans. After only a few hours of debate, we will be asked to change the viewpoint of centuries. We will be asking doctors, who have sworn an oath to not play God, to instead do just that and be the agents of death for some patients.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320276"> We are doing this without consultation, without asking doctors, nurses, and pharmacists if they want that responsibility. This is not what they were trained to do. This may not be what they want to do, but Parliament is planning on telling them to do it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320277">The haste with which we are being asked to overturn centuries of thought and practice is unseemly. I understand the Supreme Court, in setting this deadline, is only doing what it perceives as being proper. I am sure the justices of the court are well-meaning men and women, genuinely  concerned with the plight of those who are terminally ill, in pain, and who wish to end their lives but are physically unable to do so.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320278">I am sure that I am not alone in receiving calls, letters, emails, and submissions from people opposed to this legislation. Many have come from those who take a religious approach to this issue. From what I can see, people of faith, Christian, Muslim, or Jewish, are united in their belief in the sacredness of life, and feel that in endorsing so-called assisted dying, the state is intruding into areas that should be beyond its jurisdiction.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320279">It seems to me that we, as a nation, should be having a full and lengthy debate on how we approach life and quality of life, a debate perhaps done under more objective circumstances than when a loved one is suffering from an incurable illness. We are being asked to make profoundly disturbing choices and ordered to do it now. It does not take much talent to predict that in the aftermath of this legislation there will be confusion.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320280">However, if killing patients becomes an option, for whatever supposedly good reason, how long will it be before that reason becomes more flexible than rigid? What about those with no family who are a drain on hospital resources? Would it not be in the financial best interests of society to end their lives? </ParaText><ParaText id="4320281">How are we going to prevent families from pressuring their aged ones, urging them to request death so that the next generation of the family will be financially better off? There are so many issues that are still unresolved. We are acting in haste, and it seems to be almost guaranteed that we will get it wrong.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320282"> This brings me to this hastily drafted piece of legislation that we are considering tonight. Apparently the government has decided that the idea of assisted suicide is not itself worthy of debate. It seems to be a foregone conclusion that despite the objections of people of faith and many other Canadians, medically assisted dying is a done deal. Laying aside any debate on the merits or lack thereof on the concept of assisted dying, we need to examine this bill and deal with its flaws. </ParaText><ParaText id="4320283">I am extremely concerned about the safeguards, or perhaps I should say the lack of safeguards, that this legislation provides for those who, in good conscience, do not wish to take part in aiding someone's death. Simply put, the bill does not go far enough in protecting those people.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="20">(2220)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4320284">What happens when a physician, in good conscience, declines to end someone's life? We do not know. We are told that there will be protection of conscience rights, but that is not spelled out in the legislation. Apparently, that will be left for the provinces to figure out, or for someone else to make the rules, and who, we are not told.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320285">If I were a physician, I would be feeling very uneasy right now. The legislation spells out how doctors would not be subject to prosecution for ending someone's life if they requested aid in dying. What would happen to health care professionals who decline to end a life? What penalties would the state impose on them if they wish to abide by their conscience, or would the state not allow them to follow the dictates of conscience and insist they become killers?</ParaText><ParaText id="4320286">Supporters of the legislation, I am sure, will tell us that, of course, no one would be forced to perform actions they consider to be unethical. If so, where is that in the legislation? Health care professionals cannot be faulted for being uneasy when they are told, “Trust us”.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320287">We might not be discussing this issue if we were doing a better job as a nation in assisting those approaching the end of their natural life. Where is the commitment of the government to increase funding for palliative care, which was an election promise unfulfilled in budget 2016? </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320288">Three billion dollars was promised for long-term and palliative care, but nothing was delivered. Should we not, as a nation, be considering how to improve the quality of life for those facing serious illness, or is it just cheaper to encourage them to end their own lives to save money for the health care system? Access to proper palliative care would be an essential part of end-of-life decision-making and, in many cases, would encourage people not to take their own lives. </ParaText><ParaText id="4320289">When we are talking about conscience in these matters, the concept goes beyond the rights of individuals. It also strikes deep at the nature of our health care system. Has the government given any consideration to the fact that many of the hospitals in our country were founded by religious organizations and are still run by them, groups whose members would not look favourably on the idea of being ordered by government to assist in providing services to which they are philosophically opposed? Is that something, again, to be left for the provinces to work out? </ParaText><ParaText id="4320290">Is it the government's intention to require hospitals run by Roman Catholics or the Salvation Army to administer procedures that run counter to their deeply held beliefs? What right is more important, and how does the government choose? What sort of coercion would be applied to force individuals and organizations to abandon deeply held beliefs?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320291">The legislation before us is deeply flawed. It should not be supported unless it is greatly improved, especially in providing protection for freedom of conscience for both individuals and institutions in the health care system.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It is approaching 12 years that I have been a member of Parliament in this place and, unlike some other members, there are issues on which I have received more correspondence. However, I have received a fair bit of input from my constituents and, not surprisingly, it varies. I want to express my appreciation because the democratic process only works when everyone is engaged, when citizens speak what they feel are the fundamental principles involved.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320308"> I also want to give a special shout to one of the high school classes at Bishop James Mahoney High School, which I was at last week. We discussed these very profound issues. The young people in a grade 11 class had thought about it deeply. They had read the legislation. They had gone through it, unfortunately I might say, more thoroughly than some of the parliamentarians who may be voting on this in the future. The students had come to some very clear conclusions and understandings about what this is, because however a member will vote on what we are speaking on tonight, this is a moral issue for however we deal it. Not that most, if not all, issues do not have a moral component, but this one in particular is fairly clear.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320309">As has been said by other members, this is also a fairly personal thing. Each and every one of us will have to deal with death at one time in our lives. </ParaText><ParaText id="4320310">I was on the phone earlier today with my mother, and she reminded me that it was exactly a year ago today when she called me and said to go down to the nursing home because my grandma was passing away. She did not pass away that day, but she knew she was dying. I held her. It was one of those times when we begin to think about the consequences.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320311"> There had been the previous court ruling. One has responsibilities to family, to country, to everything. As a member of Parliament, I feel that all members of Parliament, even those who cannot speak to this debate, have a duty to tell their constituents how they stand.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320312">The first point I wish to make tonight is one that people need to understand. The law is a blunt instrument. The law is not something that can easily distinguish fine and distinguishable cases. The law is something that is very difficult to implement in very specific situations. In a situation like this where we are dealing with a law that involves the protection of life, we must give the absolute greatest caution and protections to life. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320313">Pollsters ask questions. They ask people how they would vote in this situation or that situation. However, to be perfectly blunt, no pollster can encapsulate the complexity of even one unique situation. Yet we as legislators are asked to make a decision, to come to some sort of conclusion. That is part of our job.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320314">Because the law is such a blunt instrument, because the law cannot distinguish in the most subtle cases, and because human beings are valuable, we must give whatever protections we can to life. It is for that reason that, whatever the restrictions that have been suggested by other members tonight, I will be supporting that. I suspect that I will be in the minority in this House in that I will not be supporting the legislation, because I do not support the underlying principle of the legislation. I suspect that I will be in an even smaller minority in that I would be prepared to support the notwithstanding clause to override the Supreme Court's decision.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320315">However, it comes down to that basic and fundamental understanding that the purpose of civil society and the purpose of government is to protect life—life, liberty, and the protection of property. Those are the things that we are to do.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320316">Yesterday, I was at an event where we had a speaker talking about freedom and about the issues involved. He noted that throughout history there have been different forms of government, but mostly they have come down to three basic styles: familial, clan-style government like there are in many African tribal societies and like the clan system of northern Scotland; a hierarchical system, such as dictatorships and the system in the Middle Ages when they had the emperor, the king, the surfs, etc.; or a covenantal system where each and every member of society agrees, sometimes to some degree compelled by law but often through their own decision, to their own actions and their commitment to morality, to be covenanted to be part of and supportive of their neighbour.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="35">(2235)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4320317">That is one thing we need to understand. The basis of constitutional government is a system where we covenant to each other, to support each other, and not because we are forced to through a hierarchical power structure. Yes, there are police, laws, and ways of dealing with wrongdoers. However, each and every one of us has a particular commitment to our fellow citizens throughout our lives, even until the end of our lives. That needs to be thought about in each and every situation as we debate this legislation. That commitment to each other, at the bare minimum, is a commitment to defend the lives of our fellow citizens and fellow human beings.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320318">Earlier last month, in the popular press, there were stories about some doctors in Quebec. I hope this is a mistaken story as these things are often exaggerated, but the story was told that some doctors had refused to treat people who had attempted suicide, even though they were very treatable. The college of physicians and surgeons in Quebec had to set a guideline to say that if people go into the hospital, doctors must treat them and not just assume that because they have attempted suicide, they have given an indication that they want to die. If the people are not covered under either the Quebec law or the Supreme Court ruling, they must be treated. Doctors have a responsibility, a covenant, to protect the life of a human being and that is the job of a doctor in an emergency ward.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320319">When I read that article, I thought to myself that we need to understand that this is one of the consequences of passing this legislation. There are people, regardless of how many protections there are, whose lives will be taken because of this legislation. Again, I hope the story in Quebec was incorrect, but if it was true, there were people who attempted suicide, cried out for help, and unfortunately, were successful, but whose lives could have been saved.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320320">Because of this debate politically, because of the ruling of the Supreme Court, and because of previous legislation by one of the provinces, there is a very real possibility some doctors did not interfere. When we hear about and discuss the suffering that people are concerned about—and in many cases, it is the fear as much as the suffering that people want to end as they come to the end of their lives—we need to understand that each and every one of us, even as we approach the end of our lives, still has that covenant with our fellow man. The question of how much suffering for one human life is one that we are very practically applying today in this legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320321">We need to understand that and ask ourselves how much suffering and fear we want to deal with and how much we want people to take in exchange for a human life. We make those decisions. We have to in society. It is not a morbid question; it is a realistic question. We set speed limits. We do these things. We know there are consequences to actions. We cannot live in a perpetual bubble.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320322">The point I am making is this. Even at the end of life, if one has fear or pain—and I do not doubt the sincerity, the depth, and the agony of people who go through this—the decisions people make as they approach the end of their lives will impact others. There will be others who, because of the changes in this law and the reasons that are given for the law, will be pressured and will lose their protections such as in the cases I referred to in the province of Quebec. That is something we cannot forget. The ultimate duty of civil society and of government is to protect life. We must do it at all costs.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320323">I again want to thank my constituents and my fellow members of Parliament, but to have a clear conscience, I must vote against this legislation. I can do no other.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It does not matter what our background or what our basis is, atheist, religious, irreligious, whatever it is and for whatever reason.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320337">For the trauma that a person could feel if he or she helped to assist someone else to die, for just that personal reason, even if one supports the principle of the legislation, there should be no restriction on this conscience legislation, whatever we put with the bill.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I am mailing out what I call a constituency referendum. It is effectively a survey designed to ask them in as impartial a way as possible how they would have their member of Parliament vote. The reason I am doing this is that I believe, when it comes to a profound issue of conscience like this, the consciences of my constituents are every bit as good as my own conscience, that of the other members of Parliament, or the people on the Supreme Court of Canada. They will guide me at third reading.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320341">My comments today are, therefore, about the underlying issue that I think is at stake here as we, meaning Parliament, the courts, the policy-makers here in Canada and frankly in every country in the world, must face as we deal with the realities of life and death at this particular moment in time.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320342">Right now, and this is not something that has always been true in our history, life is expensive, maintaining life is expensive, and death is cheap. This is something that has not been true throughout our history.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320343">Anybody who reads the novels of the Brontë sisters is aware of the fact that in the mid-19th century, and in every century before that, life was relatively inexpensive to maintain, in part because the ability of medical technology to keep people alive was so limited. The doctor would arrive, perhaps bleed someone if they had a simple fever, and then, at least this is how it happens in the novels, advise the relatives to prepare themselves. The financial difference between life and death was very limited.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320344">That is no longer true. I want to make this point in the context of a health issue that has nothing to do with euthanasia or the assisted suicide or assisted dying debate, but it really illustrates just how expensive life is in a world of improved technology and pharmaceuticals.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320345">This month, May is cystic fibrosis month. I know somebody who has cystic fibrosis, and I have become very passionately involved in this. Every year, I encourage members of Parliament to wear a rose, and we will all be doing this next Wednesday, in honour of those who have cystic fibrosis. I wear the cystic fibrosis pin today.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320346">Now there was a drug introduced in 2012, called ivacaftor, trade name Kalydeco, which, for the 4% to 5% of cystic fibrosis patients who have the delta-F508 mutation of the gene with the CFTR protein, for that small segment of cystic fibrosis sufferers, this drug effectively turns what would otherwise be a terminal disease into a manageable illness that is problematic but not fatal.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320347">It is available at a very high cost to them, their families, or the public health care system, depending on where the patient lives. The cost to get access to Kalydeco is approximately $300,000 American per year. The patents on drugs are typically about 20 years long. Presumably at the end of that 20-year period, the cost will drop dramatically, but right now it is $300,000 per year. Members can do the math, $300,000 times 20 means that it is $6 million to keep one individual alive.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320348"> It is well worthwhile, but the fact is that life is expensive, whereas denying them this care, and some provinces do not give public funding for the drug, is cheap. That costs very little. I do not mean to suggest that the drug company is charging unreasonably, or any of these other subsidiary questions. It cost $458 million for Vertex, the company that developed this drug, to bring it to market. My observation is simply that life is very expensive and maintaining life is expensive. Death is cheap.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320349">Now, turning to palliative care, of course it costs a great deal less than this to keep people alive on palliative care at the end of their lives. However, the fact is that denying care is less expensive. This is exclusive of the Supreme Court ruling. It is exclusive of whatever is in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> or should, or should not, be in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>. This creates a dynamic in which there is a strong financial incentive for policy-makers to promote the less expensive option, as there is in everything.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="50">(2250)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4320350">In this case, it means that the incentive to do what is necessary to allow the life option as opposed to the death option is reversed or weakened. This means the incentive to not provide palliative care is going to be very strong.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320351">In this situation, the Supreme Court of Canada ruling in Carter v. Canada is likely to have tilted the dynamic in favour of death as a solution to the high-cost problem of maintaining lives that are deemed to be not worth living.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320352">To make the point about how this is relevant, I want to quote from what the <Affiliation DbId="214491" Type="2">health minister</Affiliation> said on the Friday before the break, in her speech on the issue. I had the good fortune to be able to question her afterwards about this. She said:</ParaText><ParaText id="4320353"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> Today, Canadians are aware, and have a general understanding, of palliative care. However, some studies have [shown] that the overwhelming majority, perhaps 70% or more of us, do not have access to it, particularly in rural and remote areas. Many providers are not well trained to provide palliative care services. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4320354">I think she was just presenting what she regards correctly, as a fact. However, read this a different way and a more sinister meaning becomes evident. We lack the funds, or the provinces lack the funds, for palliative care, but death is the less expensive way to ensure that no one lives an unbearable life.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320355">Again, I do not think she meant this in a sinister way. The implication was simply there to be found, and taking her words and reading them a little differently, we see that implication.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320356">Faced with this problem, the problem brought upon us by the fact that we can extend life in a way that never could before but with limited funds and, inevitably, there are not enough funds to deal with all the life needs that are out there, the wrong move taken for a reason that seems noble but is poorly thought through could have disastrous consequences.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320357">To make this point, I want to turn to one of the best books on public policy I have ever read, <I>Lectures on the Relation between Law and Public Opinion in England during the Nineteenth Century</I>, by the great Albert Venn Dicey.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320358"> Writing about Lord Shaftesbury, the well-meaningful philanthropist and statesman, he writes something that I think could well be applied to the Supreme Court's ruling in Carter v. Canada:</ParaText><ParaText id="4320359"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...the natural desire of an ardent philanthropist to save from immediate suffering any class of persons who are unable completely to protect themselves against oppression, and to do this by the means which lie nearest to hand, without deeply considering whether action which gives immediate relief to [these] sufferers ...may not possibly in the end produce evils of untold magnitude. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320360">In response to this, the danger is that we will do what Dicey warned about Parliament reacting. He was talking about the British Parliament. He was writing of a different century, but this is a warning that is well taken by any Parliament dealing with this kind of situation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320361">He said:</ParaText><ParaText id="4320362"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...laws passed to meet a particular emergency, or to satisfy a particular demand...produce, in the long run, more effect on legislative opinion than a law which openly embodies a wide principle. Laws of emergency often surreptitiously introduce or reintroduce into legislation, ideas which would not be accepted if brought before the attention of Parliament or of the nation. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320363">This legislation is being introduced in haste in response to an artificial deadline, and it is an artificial deadline, set up by a Supreme Court which has a noble goal in mind but which has not, in my view, looked at all the implications of what it is trying to do. In dealing with a highly atypical set of cases, all of our jurisprudence in Canada at the Supreme Court level is based upon suffers of ALS who, on that bell curve of different ways in which people can die, either fully in charge as ALS sufferers are of their wills and their minds but not of their bodies or, at the other extreme, like Alzheimer's sufferers perhaps in reasonable physical health but not in possession of their faculties, and everybody in between. We have used that set of cases that have come before us because that is the way the court system works. Only the mentally capable can get their cases to the court and the court has generalized in a way that leads, potentially, into a hasty reaction that could lead to a principle being introduced into our law which may have, as Dicey says, unfathomable consequences.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320364">I ask us all to move very cautiously and to seriously consider the possibility of amendments to this legislation in the coming weeks, as we go into committee.</ParaText>

This is a deadline that was imposed after we asked for a later deadline. On June 6, there will be serious ramifications if a law is not passed. I am at a bit of a loss to understand what is artificial about what the Supreme Court has said.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320367">Surely this is not a reflection of disrespect for the court, but it must mean something.

There is nothing special about June 6 other than the fact that the Supreme Court said that was the day on which this part of the Criminal Code would simply cease to be in force or have effect.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320370"> The court could have acted as the American court would have done and simply said that this law had no force or effect right now, period. It could have done that, which would have produced a different legislative reaction. We would not have reacted in the haste to get legislation rammed through by a certain date if it were not for the fact that the law was not being struck down until a future specific and relative approximate date. Therefore, in that sense, it is highly arbitrary and artificial.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320371">Throughout my comments, I have tried to indicate that I am not trying to be disrespectful either of the court or of the drafters of the current legislation. I am simply observing that we are potentially, as a system, responding in a very much sub-optimal way to the great health care issue of our time, which is the fact that we can save many lives, but we do not have the financial means to save all lives in the way we might choose to do. That is an issue that is going to confront us over and over again.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Also, there should be some clear language that would give health care workers and health care institutions a guarantee that they would not be required to participate in any way in physician-assisted suicide.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Reid" id="8893014"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="214290" Type="2">Mr. Scott Reid</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4320375">Mr. Speaker, earlier today I discussed with my hon. colleague for <Affiliation DbId="214378" Type="2">Kitchener—Conestoga</Affiliation> his suggestion that a mandatory palliative care consultation ought to be required prior to the process that is contemplated in the law to physicians or nurse practitioners signing-off on an assisted death request. That is an excellent proposal. </ParaText><ParaText id="4320376">We do have a shortage of these practitioners in Canada. The fact is that I can get a prescription right now electronically from someone who is not in the same room as me. Some kind of provision could be made for this. A budget could be provided for it. Right now, zero dollars have been provided for it, and I do not think the palliative care initiative that the government has talked about deals with this kind of consultation, which would be preferable.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320377">In many cases, it might be a conclusion that it is not available in one's area, but at least no one would die uninformed. Also, I think it would create pressure from relatives to start making better or more widely accessible palliative care. It is an excellent idea. If it is not incorporated into the legislation, then it should be incorporated in a later bill, which would amend the act.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320378">With regard to the issue of conscience rights, here is the problem. The right to request that one's death be caused, the right to end one's own life as a part of the right to life in section 7 of the charter, now that the courts have interpreted that right this way, imposes an obligation on others who are in a position of being state actors or semi-state actors. This would require them to assist a person. They cannot withhold this right from a person. Seeing as doctors are people who have a monopoly over health care because of their position, which is created by the state, they may be forced, unless there is a specific provision in the law, to provide that care. That is the danger, and I hope it will be corrected in amendments to the bill.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It is probably one of the most difficult, if not the most difficult, issues we are going to face in this Parliament.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320383">We all know someone who has died in pain, a loved one, a child, a colleague. We have all seen the ravages of disease on the body of people we once saw only as the embodiment of life and hope. I have lost two of my most beloved uncles to cancer. One of these uncles was a lifer in the Royal Canadian Navy, who finished his career in service to Canada as base commander at CFB Esquimalt.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320384">Commander Larry Dzioba, as any commander would be, was ready for his battle that would come. He fought cancer to the end and was still living independently, in relatively good health, up until the final two days before he passed away. I credit his strong Ukrainian stock for his strength and always think that he viewed pain as something to be tolerated.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320385">Another uncle of mine, Michael McCauley, passed away after years of chemotherapy and radiation. In the end, he passed away at home in his bed surrounded by his family. He maintained his dignity until the very end.</ParaText>

Peter and I worked together at the famed Deerhurst Resort in Muskoka, pre-gazebo days, and later together in Edmonton. Peter went from diagnosis to death in just three months, but his family and friends will forever be grateful to the wonderful staff at the Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton, who ensured that Peter lived his final days as comfortably as possible and with dignity.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320387">Unfortunately, however, far too many Canadians suffer due to inadequate palliative care. A 2015 study shows that anywhere from 15% to 30% of Canadians have access to adequate palliative care, and even at the highest levels of the spectrum, it is nowhere near enough.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320388">This is where my concerns with Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> begin. From the bill's preamble, I quote the following:</ParaText><ParaText id="4320389"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Whereas it is desirable to have a consistent approach to medical assistance in dying across Canada</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4320390">The government wishes to have a universal approach to assisted suicide in Canada, but does not state the need for universal access to palliative care across Canada. Members of the House have repeatedly commented on access to broadband Internet as a human right, yet there is nothing about a human right to palliative care. The government commits to broadband expansion in its 2016 budget, but if we search “palliative” in budget 2016, we get the message ''no matches were found''. It is disgraceful and shameful. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320391">The health minister has said that $3 billion will be committed over four years for palliative care across the country, but there are no details on this. It is not listed once in the budget. There is no information on how it will be rolled out or how it will be paid for. </ParaText><ParaText id="4320392">In fact, the $3 billion is probably the same $3 billion that the Liberals promised in their election campaign for increased home care services. It is not specifically for palliative care, which they are stating now, but for home care services.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320393">Alarmingly, the health minister said in January, just before meeting with provincial health ministers, that "more money isn't necessarily the only solution”. The $3 billion is promised, yet it does not seem to exist anywhere in the budget and, according to the government, may not be necessary. I would argue that virtually every doctor who treats terminally ill patients would disagree. </ParaText><ParaText id="4320394">It is paramount that the government states immediately how it will ensure equal access to proper palliative care across this country. It is unfathomable that the government would introduce assisted dying legislation without announcing a detailed strategy to prevent terminally ill Canadians from believing doctor-assisted suicide is their only option.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320395">The government has a moral obligation to outline such a strategy and provide adequate funding immediately. It is not enough to simply spout off a few talking points, get in a few good sound bites, and then hope it is later forgotten.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="05">(2305)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4320396">The government has not done nearly enough to think through this bill in its haste to meet the Supreme Court's deadline. It has not begun to consult with the provinces on many of the responsibilities that will be downloaded onto them. For example, Alberta has been working on this for five months with no apparent consultation with the government.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320397">I believe assisted suicide is not the answer to the complex problem of human suffering, whether it be physical, emotional, or even spiritual suffering. Medical advances specifically in pain management drugs have gone a long way in helping the suffering bear pain and keep their dignity. What is really needed above and beyond the medical advances and improvements in palliative care is a willingness to be involved in the lives of those who suffer. The reasonable answer to suffering is love, companionship, and hope for the better, hope for tomorrow, for hope allows us to continue on.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320398">In addition to the philosophical objections that I have to this bill, there are many practical concerns. One is the lack of education on the matter of alternative methods for care of the terminally ill. For example, a survey of pre-licensure pain curricula in the health science faculties of 10 different Canadian universities showed that many would-be doctors receive less training in pain management than their counterparts in veterinary medicine. Meanwhile, a survey of over 1,100 doctors and nurses showed that those who treat fewer terminally ill patients, therefore knowing the least about symptom management, are most likely the ones in favour of assisted suicide, whereas those with the most experience with symptom management and end-of-life care tend to oppose it.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320399">Dr. Max Chochinov, a noted specialist on palliative care, explains that the will to live is directly inverse to the amount of pain and that loss of dignity drives wanting to die and treatment of pain can improve sense of dignity.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320400"> I realize that we will have doctor-assisted suicide in Canada. The courts have decreed it, and society appears to demand it, but we in this House must ensure that we are doing everything to ensure we protect the vulnerable and enshrine the belief that all life is precious before we introduce a new law.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320401"> There are holes that must be addressed before Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> becomes law. Like many others in the House, I am disappointed that there are no provisions to protect the rights of doctors, nurses, and other medical practitioners who object to participating in assisted dying or referring on conscience grounds. We must protect their rights regarding referrals as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320402">My own doctor stated on the issue, “not selling you a drug but sending you to a street corner for drugs where you are murdered makes me just as complicit in your death.” I enjoy the bluntness of my doctor.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320403">It is not enough to simply leave it to the provinces or to say that there is no problem because so far no health professional has been forced against his or her conscience to perform certain acts. The rights of health care professionals must be respected and must be enshrined in federal law. It has always been our society's custom to assist the suffering, to be by their side, and not to kill them. This practice must be reaffirmed, and a respectful approach to human life must be upheld, one that recognizes that the intrinsic worth with which every human being is endowed is not eradicated by suffering. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320404">Life is precious and I believe that our nation's laws must reflect this fact. In the <I>Gospel of Life</I>, Pope John Paul II wrote very eloquently about the issue of assisted suicide. He stated that assisted suicide is a crime which no human law can claim to legitimize. However, he further stated that elected officials “could licitly support proposals aimed at limiting the harm done by such a law and at lessening its negative consequences at the level of general opinion and public morality. This does not in fact represent an illicit cooperation with an unjust law, but rather a legitimate and proper attempt to limit its evil aspects.”</ParaText><ParaText id="4320405"> Doctor-assisted suicide is already a reality in Canada. While I acknowledge that Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> reflects many of the safeguards of the dissenting report put forward by my Conservative colleagues on the special committee, it is still a flawed piece of legislation. It does not include an obligation to provide all possible palliative and pain management options to terminally ill patients. It does not mandate that funding be given and then maintained for end-of-life care. It does not guard the conscience rights of medical professionals. Beyond this, Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> does not offer a legitimate and proper attempt to limit the evil aspects of suicide. It is for these reasons that I will not be supporting this bill. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We know that a number of Quebeckers are working in Alberta. The media are reporting an incredible tragedy that is taking place as we sit here in the House. I want everyone there to know that we are thinking of them. </ParaText><ParaText id="4320418">I thought long and hard before speaking to this important issue tonight, not because I did not want to talk about it or because the subject was not important to me, but because this is a hugely complicated issue. It took Quebec more than six years of work, thought, and study to reach a consensus, and even after all that work, it was not unanimous.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320419">The proof is that most of the palliative care facilities in Quebec have not begun offering this option to their clients within their facility. I am going to focus on that in my remarks.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320420">The joint committee recommended making more resources available for palliative care to improve access across Canada. I agree with that recommendation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320421">I had the opportunity to tour a palliative care centre last year when I visited my brother-in-law, who was dying. This evening, before speaking to the House, I also called an acquaintance who sits on the board of directors of a foundation that helps fund these types of homes in my riding. This person confirmed what I had noted last year. The mission of these homes is to take care of the dying and not to take their life. These homes support patients in their final weeks, days, and hours of life. The services and support that the individuals themselves and their families receive at these homes are essential so that they can live their final moments in dignity.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320422">I believe it is important, as we prepare to pass such a law, to have the time to study it and put it in place. I do not believe that it is appropriate to move so quickly on such important issues as life and death.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320423">My acquaintance also told me that she had lost a colleague a few weeks earlier. Her colleague knew that he was sick and that she was connected to the administration of the home. He told her that he wanted the opportunity to make use of the new Quebec law on end-of-life care and that he very much wanted to have access to such care. The weeks passed, and it came time for him to enter the home, where he could end his days in peace, with the idea of making use of the new Quebec law.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320424">My acquaintance had the opportunity to visit him before he passed, and this man told her that he no longer wanted that option because he appreciated the care and attention he received from the staff and volunteers in the home so much that he wanted to live until his last breath. He probably talked about that option because he was afraid of suffering, of losing control, of making his family suffer. All of his fears were legitimate. </ParaText><ParaText id="4320425">This example shows that it is possible for someone to live with dignity, surrounded by family members, in settings tailored to their needs, with attentive and, above all, competent people around for this extremely important stage in any human being's life.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320426">I am giving these examples, not because they are something I experienced, but because they illustrate some of all the different possibilities and situations that could arise.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320427">My colleagues who sat on the joint committee worked very hard to ensure that certain provisions would be included in the bill, and I would like to talk about those provisions now. They are all equally important and they represent an essential minimum in the bill before us today.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320428">We identified five important points and we insisted that they be included in the bill. The first is that medical assistance in dying should be available only to adults. It should not be made available to minors. Medically assisted dying should not be made available to people who are mentally ill. The conscience rights of doctors must be protected and consent to the termination of life may be given only at the end of a person's life. Finally, palliative care needs to be improved.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="20">(2320)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4320429">In my opinion, that last point is an important aspect of the bill. Services like those offered by Maison Desjardins in Rivière-du-Loup, which is in my riding, should be available all across Canada, given how important these facilities are to those who work there and those who use them. The government should therefore invest in these types of services and facilities across the country. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the government has no plans to do that at the moment.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320430">Another person I know in Montmagny has been receiving cancer treatment for many years. She decided to start up a palliative care facility in the Montmagny and L’Islet region, where she has been working tirelessly for many years. An army of volunteers are helping her and supporting her in her illness and in setting up the facility. My hope is that when her time comes she will be able to benefit from all of the effort she put into that facility. In order to ensure that these types of facilities are available, the government needs to create the proper conditions to help communities take matters into their own hands and offer places across Canada where people can live out their final days with dignity.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320431">What we are really talking about in the House tonight is human dignity. It is crucial that all future decisions be made in a way that ensures that end-of-life care is available all across Canada. That is crucial.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320432"> In closing, in my riding next Friday, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="213959" Type="2">Louis-Saint-Laurent</Affiliation> and I are organizing an evening of discussion to promote a better understanding of this very serious issue. Knowing that we were elected on October 19 and given how quickly everything is happening right now, I feel as though we are caught in a trap and working against the clock, which means we cannot make informed decisions. In spite of everything, I will be voting in favour of this bill at second reading, so that the bill can go to committee and we can examine the committee's recommendations.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320433">This does not mean that I will vote in favour of the final bill. I am committing to making a decision after listening to my constituents. I think this is a fundamental decision. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind: as the representatives of our constituents, we must listen to them and allow them to share their views. We do not have much time to respond to this bill. I was listening to my colleagues earlier and it occurred to me that June 6 is an arbitrary date. There will be a June 6 in 2017, a June 6 in 2018, and so on. I think we should be taking the time to really think about this legislation and make it as complete as possible.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

There is a major difference between the Quebec legislation and the proposed Canadian legislation. Under the Quebec legislation, a health care professional must be present until the very end. However, under the Canadian legislation, a health care professional could give the patient the lethal drug and then leave the patient alone. That seems unthinkable to me. We cannot talk with so much compassion for hours and then imagine that under this bill, someone could be given the drug he needs to end his life without anyone by his side throughout the process.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320437">I would like to know what my colleague thinks about that.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I know members have spoken politely, softly, and respectfully. This has been the tone on all sides. However, I wonder if I may stretch that tone a little bit.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320447">This is the most important issue that Parliament will deal with, I suspect, in a very long time. Without resorting to personal attacks, this is an issue to get angry about, if there ever was one.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320448"> The mistakes that we stand to make in this legislation mean that men and women may die who would not have otherwise, who will be missed because of the absence of advance review, who will be pressured forward because of the lack of palliative care, and who will be matched with willing physicians because of allowances for doctor shopping, even if they have been identified as not meeting the criteria by their own and other physicians.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320449">Tonight, we should be angry. Canadians should be angry. While speaking softly and politely about the need to talk about death and the need to listen, the government is proceeding to shut down debate after only two days. The invocation of closure in this case will not in any way affect the timeline of this bill. We know that.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320450"> It is already being studied at the justice committee, and even days of additional debate would not prevent the justice committee from proceeding on the timeline it has already set. A vote would not change that. It would not affect the timeline at all, and yet the government is proceeding to shut down debate with its notice of closure motion coming forward tomorrow.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320451">Canadians who care about this issue from all sides, Canadians who care about the important role we have as legislators to examine and debate legislation in this House, these Canadians should be angry about what is happening on this legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320452">The absence of meaningful debate increases the significant chances of error when it comes to shaping legislation that is, in my view, already riddled with problems. An error on an issue this important will mean unnecessary loss of life.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320453">I have already spoken about my substantive concerns on this bill, but by way of quick review, this legislation contains no meaningful safeguards because even the exceptions in it are riddled with holes. The written consent provision excludes those who cannot sign. The waiting period can be routinely waived. Mental illness is not at all clearly excluded.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320454"> The requirement that death be reasonably foreseeable is too ambiguous to effectively exclude anyone. The requirement that two doctors sign off merely encourages doctor shopping. Even if the already-ambiguous criteria are not followed, people who kill an unwilling patient can be let off the hook if they claim a reasonable but mistaken belief that the criteria applied.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320455">I have said that we have here a perfect storm: ambiguous criteria and a reasonable but mistaken belief clause, which means that it would be nearly impossible to prosecute anyone who kills a patient, even without consent. We have heard the data from countries with similar systems and the impact they have on patients who do not consent.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320456">All of these problems could be fixed through amendments. A requirement for advance review by competent legal authority would ensure that those who do not consent are not pushed forward against their will. Provisions on palliative care and conscience protection would better protect the autonomy of patients and would also protect the autonomy of physicians.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320457">We could discuss these changes. We could make these changes. We ought to.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320458">Tonight, I want to also do what other members in this House have done, and that is to share stories about life and stories about death. </ParaText><ParaText id="4320459">My story starts around the turn of the last century in Germany, with a Jewish doctor named Rudolf Kuppenheim, the first person in his family who was able to get a university education. One day in the course of his practice, a young child named Gertrud was brought to him for treatment for diphtheria. At the time, the usual treatment was to make a small slit in the throat that would allow the afflicted child to breath. The child's mother, however, resisted this treatment. Her mother refused to allow Dr. Rudolf Kuppenheim to make the necessary incision, because it would leave a scar. The mother believed that the scar would prevent her daughter from getting married.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="30">(2330)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4320460">Rudolf became angry, very angry, and justly so. He berated the woman for putting her daughter's life at risk. Notwithstanding the social pressures and the challenges that a young woman might face in that culture and time, this girl's life, her value, her dignity, were not dependent on whether or not she could find a husband.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320461">As it happened, that girl not only got married, but she later married that doctor's son. That couple had a daughter who was born Ursula Lilly Kuppenheim, and Ursula Lilly Kuppenheim was my grandmother.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320462">She grew up in a society that denied her dignity as well. As a half-Jewish child, she lived through the horrors of the Holocaust, only able to leave Germany after the war. Her mother had her dignity denied because she might have been hard to marry off. She had her dignity denied because of her Jewish heritage, but the shifting vagaries of social attitudes never changed who these women were: human beings.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320463">Rudolf Kuppenheim and his wife tragically took their own lives when the Gestapo came to their home. Suicide is always a tragedy, but I understand that they were in a position where they felt that they had no other choice: suicide or tortured death in a concentration camp. No just society forces people to make that choice, but at the time my grandmother lived.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320464">In 2006, my grandmother, or Oma as we called her, died of cancer. Everyone dies, but not everyone truly lives. Across continents, from persecution to extensive contribution, my grandmother truly lived.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320465">She always told us that she wanted to die like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob did. They did not suffer or get sick, at least at the time of their death. They just realized that they were about to die, called their families together, and said goodbye. That is what she wanted, but it did not happen that way. She did suffer very much.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320466">Suffering is a part of the human condition. It is just and right that we seek to minimize it. It is also just and right that we understand that a human who suffers does not cease to be human, to have value, to have dignity. She had dignity from the moment she was born to the moment she died, whether her dignity was denied because of her Jewishness or because of her illness.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320467">Members here have to understand that the so-called dying with dignity movement is shaped by a very dangerous view of humanity. It views human beings as instrumental or experiential creatures, valued for what they do or for the quality of their experiences, but that is not what we are. We are in fact creatures with intrinsic value.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320468">We value the dignity of human beings, not principally because they are useful, because they are having a good time, or because they want to be valued. We value human beings because of what they are. We understand intrinsically the difference between human rights and animal rights, rights for creatures which have feelings and experiences only, and rights for creatures that have value intrinsically. This movement, this presumption that the ill or disabled lack dignity could not be more wrong. </ParaText><ParaText id="4320469">I want to conclude with a final appeal to all members. If they have grave concerns about this legislation, stand up and vote against it at second reading. I know some members are worried about the possibility of a legal vacuum, but this legislation replaces ambiguous criteria with other ambiguous criteria. It does not create any kind of review mechanism. Fundamentally, it replaces one vacuum with another.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320470">There is a better way. If members vote down this legislation or even ensure that the vote is closer, the government can, will, and indeed must come back with a more serious bill, and if it does a better job of incorporating certain specific proposals we have made, then we can all work together to ensure a quick passage of a better bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320471">Alternatively, if we go along just because we want to proceed, we will have entrenched a piece of legislation that will cause real problems, life and death problems, problems that will be very hard to fix.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320472">It is disgusting, but we have a proposal to invoke closure on an issue so vital, on an issue of life and death, after only two days of debate. We must stand up to this. We must make our stand. I have made mine and I ask members in the House to make theirs. </ParaText>

If one believes that humans have value, that has consequences, obviously, for one's desire to give them choices. Also, however, a belief in intrinsic human value with dignity can limit choices if individuals wish to, in a dramatic way, harm themselves in a way that denies their intrinsic value. The basis of autonomy is this respect for intrinsic human dignity in all cases, in all circumstances, which must be preserved.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320477">The amendments that I have proposed are not ones that in any way derogate from autonomy with respect to euthanasia or assisted suicide. There are things like advance review, a guaranteed offer of palliative care, conscience protection for physicians, and more robust criteria, which will actually ensure that people who have suicidal ideations for short periods of time do not access this so-called service when, in fact, their longer-term desires are to live. These are things that protect a more robust notion of autonomy in all cases.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320478">Clearly, whatever one thinks of the underlying question, let us marshal our energies in the direction of fixing these problems in the bill to protect both human dignity and values of autonomy.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The Carter/C-14 doctrine of autonomy is a clear repudiation of that kind of faith and the establishment of a new faith in man as utterly independent of God. One does not need to be Abrahamic to understand this. If the Parliament of Canada recognizes personal autonomy as extending a moral right to determine the manner and timing of one’s own death, and to take one’s own life or another’s life, it necessarily recognizes the person—and [Parliament] itself as a deliberative body of persons—as lying outside of all putative divine authority in such matters. In short, the C-14 preamble is the final repudiation of the Charter preamble. “The principles of fundamental justice”...now operate independently of any reference whatsoever to the supremacy of God. The link between “the supremacy of God and the rule of law” is decisively severed.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4320495">He then goes on to quote Nietzsche:</ParaText>

Are we not straying, as through an infinite nothing? Do we not feel the breath of empty space? Has it not become colder? Is not night continually closing in on us? Do we not need to light lanterns in the morning? Do we hear nothing as yet of the noise of the gravediggers who are burying God? Do we smell nothing as yet of the divine decomposition?

Let me first say that I am very thankful that the government decided not to follow through with all of the recommendations made in the Liberal-dominated special joint committee report and decided rather to incorporate many of the comments of the dissenting report created by me and other members of the Conservative Party. </ParaText><ParaText id="4320498">While Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> is a huge improvement from the very permissive, wide-open regime recommended by the joint committee, the legislation falls far short in protecting some of our most vulnerable Canadians, and as a result, I cannot support it. </ParaText>

This includes the need to make a referral to a participating doctor. </ParaText><ParaText id="4320500">While the preamble states boldly that that it is “desirable to have a consistent approach to medical assistance in dying across Canada”, and later refers to “respect the personal convictions of health care providers”, there is no section in the actual clauses of Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document>, no clear, unequivocal statement that no doctor or health care worker would be under any obligation to participate. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320501">Just as important, what about health care institutions and hospices which, because of the core values they embrace, may not want to have physician-assisted suicide available in their institutions? What about a hospice which raises upward of 50% of its own revenue from private donations and which relies largely on armies of volunteers and donors who believe in the inherent and intrinsic dignity of human life? My fear is that if any of these institutions are forced into situations in which they are obligated to engage in physician-assisted suicide, the community may face the very real possibility of losing those volunteers and donors, and ultimately, may in fact lose the very institution itself. This would be a tragic unintended consequence of not guaranteeing conscience rights to doctors, health care workers, and institutions. </ParaText><ParaText id="4320502">These changes must be included in Bill <Document DbId="8177165" Type="3">C-14</Document> if we are to respect the professionals and institutions that provide excellent quality of health care every day. </ParaText><ParaText id="4320503">There also needs to be a clear commitment to providing palliative care as a real and viable option.

Each of us in this room have made the mistake of making a short-term decision without adequately considering the long-term consequences.</ParaText><ParaText id="4320518">I am very concerned about where we are going with this bill. Many of my colleagues, on both sides of the House, have given illustrations from other jurisdictions that have implemented a regime similar to the one we are considering, in fact in some cases more restrictive than the one we are considering. Yet over time, those jurisdictions have seen an incredible widening of the door, while thinking at first they had adequate safeguards, and in a very short time moving from a smaller number of people accessing physician-assisted suicide to an increase within a period of 15 years, for example, in Belgium I believe, it went from 330 to over 2,200 last year.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4320519">If we are to extrapolate those numbers to Canada with a population of three times that of Belgium, we are looking at potentially over 6,000 Canadians dying by physician-assisted suicide in one year.
