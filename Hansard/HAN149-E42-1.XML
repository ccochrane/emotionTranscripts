It will be my pleasure to give him the floor on this fundamental issue. I do not think I have ever discussed an issue with such serious consequences on the state's ability to provide services to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788814">I think it is now fair to say that we no longer live in a fair and equitable tax environment that works well for our workers, those less fortunate, and the poorest families in our country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788815">Let us put things in context. We live in a society where every year we hear the same old story: by noon on January 2, CEOs of major Canadian companies have already earned as much in a little over 24 hours as an average worker will earn for the entire 365 days of the year. It is this type of inequitable society that the successive Conservative and Liberal governments have built over time. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788816">Two billionaire Canadians have as much money as the poorest third of the population. Two people alone have the equivalent of what 12 million people have in our country. Are we supposed to just accept that and move on? The highest paid CEOs in Canada earn 193 times more than the average salary and the gap has only gotten bigger over the years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788817">A number of things explain this increased inequality. According to the Gini coefficient, which measures inequality, for a decade now, inequality has been growing at a much faster rate in Canada than in the United States, a society often considered to have greater inequality. Inequality is growing faster here than there. How did that happen? What caused this to happen? There are several reasons. In his book <I>Une escroquerie légalisée</I>, Alain Deneault provides a list of reasons that is impressive, but not comprehensive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788818">First, there was the reduction in federal corporate tax rates, which dropped from 37.8% in 1981 to only 15% in 2012. Next, the federal capital tax was eliminated. Then, the federal capital gains inclusion rate was cut from 75% to 50% in 2000. I will come back to that. We could also mention the sales tax and duty exemptions, and the fact that some companies can indefinitely defer payment of their taxes. Well, imagine that! Let us attempt to do the same with our T4 slips in just over a month's time, see how that goes. Let us not forget that some mining and oil and gas companies can be set up as non-taxable income trusts, and that tax rates for Canadian taxable assets owned by non-residents are declining.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788819">This is not an exhaustive list, but it does show that over the years the trend has been to systematically favour big business and the wealthiest in our society to the detriment of those who receive a pay cheque every two weeks and are required to pay their taxes in order to receive, incidentally, fewer and fewer services.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788820">One thing that is not on that list but is nevertheless a reality is the phenomenon of people sending money to tax havens to avoid paying their fair share of taxes here in Canada. Were that tax money collected, it could be used to provide social programs and social housing, improve public transit, provide care for the elderly, and help students take on less debt. We are losing billions of dollars because that money is being sent to a bunch of sunny tax havens. It is hard to put a number on exactly how much is being lost. It is kind of frightening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788821">What is more, the problem is exacerbated by all of Canada's bilateral tax treaties, such as the one we have had with Barbados since 1980. Since then, Canadian direct investments in Barbados have increased by 3600%. Canadian businesses and individuals sent $130 billion to Barbados in 2011. Two years later, $170 billion was sent to Barbados and hidden there. Why? </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4788822">This happened because we foolishly agreed that, if people paid their taxes in Barbados and reported their earnings in Canada, they would no longer have to pay taxes in Canada. It is the principle of the avoidance of double taxation, under which people do not have to pay taxes on the same income in both countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788823">There is just one small problem: in Canada, the corporate tax rate is 15% and the individual tax rate is approximately 25% or 30%, whereas in Barbados, the tax rate is 1% or 2%. Obviously, that is nothing. People are paying their taxes in Barbados and reporting the income here in Canada. It is completely legal. There is nothing that can be done about it. Billions of dollars are being lost every year. That is why the NDP's motion proposes that all of the bilateral tax treaties be reviewed and renegotiated. These treaties are obvious scams that are depriving us of necessary resources and giving gifts to those who do not need them. It is rather mind-boggling.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788824">Canadian investors invest four times more in Barbados than in Brazil. Looking at total Canadian investments, twice as much is invested in about 10 tax havens than the total invested in China, India, and Brazil—growing countries where we need to be present. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788825">All of these multinationals are profiting from crime. They are now responsible for 40% to 60% of international economic transactions, transactions that are taking place between the same companies and their subsidiaries. They are what is called shell companies or dummy corporations, and their sole purpose is to move money to a certain address via a certain country. They are also called PO box companies. They are empty shells that produce nothing, or are sometimes paid to manage a company’s branding or logo. We have seen millions of dollars being paid to manage a logo. I would like to be able to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788826"> This has created totally absurd situations where all these dummy corporations, all these PO box companies, are often accommodated in the same place. I have one good example: in Georgetown, in the Cayman Islands, there is one building in which 18,000 companies are registered. In fact, the Cayman Islands have more registered companies than inhabitants, making their population the most entrepreneurial in the world. And the tax havens or shell companies do not exist only in the southern hemisphere. In Delaware, in the United States, the Corporation Trust Center houses no fewer than 250,000 companies on its premises. Now that is quite a number. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788827"> I have spoken a little about the tax havens, which make up a large part of the problem. Statistics Canada estimates them at $7 billion or $8 billion. The Conference Board of Canada says it is probably more like $47 billion, while Canadians for Tax Fairness cites $80 billion. The range is huge, but in any case it is a lot of money. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788828"> The other thing we would like to talk about is the Liberal promise to put an end to certain tax loopholes, particularly stock option deductions. This was a promise made during the election campaign that unfortunately has been totally forgotten. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788829"> All these tax loopholes were examined by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives in November 2016. That study has some absolutely incredible things to tell us. When we add up all these deductions, all these tax loopholes and all these tax credits, the shortfall to the public purse comes to $103 billion. Every year, about one hundred billion dollars eludes our coffers, money we could be using to care for our seniors, to treat our sick, and to have roads that make some sense. They examined 64 tax measures that constitute exemptions or deductions. Of those 64, only five are progressive; the other 59 are regressive. What does that mean? For a tax measure to be progressive, one assesses whether most of the benefit of the measure goes to the 50% poorest or the 50% wealthiest Canadians. Only five tax measures benefit the poorest, while the other 59 benefit the wealthiest. In certain cases, such as that of dividend tax credits, it is the wealthiest 10% who benefit, as much as 91% and 99%. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788830"> The Conservative and Liberal governments pulled off something absolutely incredible—they created a tax environment called Robin Hood in reverse. All of us together are going to chip in and subsidize the wealthiest.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4788831">Mr. Speaker, the number one priority of this government has been Canada's middle class and those aspiring to be a part of it. In the first budget, we saw a major shift in terms of the middle class tax cut and the Canada child benefit program. We saw it in the redistribution for our seniors with the 10% GIS increase. We saw it with the special tax of 1% on Canada's wealthiest. I would remind NDP members across the way that they voted against all of these measures. However, this is a substantial shift in addressing the issue of inequality, which the member has referenced. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788832">More importantly, we recognize that this is an important issue that the member is talking about today, and we invested over $400 million in the last budget to deal with it. This is why we will be supporting the motion. Does the member not agree that investing over $400 million to provide CRA the resources needed to get these tax evaders is encouraging? Maybe the NDP should have supported that particular initiative.</ParaText>

It would be no problem for me to find out the year the report was published.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788841"> The problem with the figure provided by Statistics Canada is that employees are able to estimate the amount only when the companies or individuals tell them that they have sent money to tax havens and that money came back here after the transfer. They are not obligated to systematically report this to Statistics Canada. The result is that these estimates are based on data that has been voluntarily submitted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788842"> This is why the Conference Board of Canada and Canadians for Tax Fairness quote numbers much higher than $7 billion or $8 billion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4788847">Mr. Speaker, I am happy to take the floor after my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="214102" Type="2">Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie</Affiliation>. I thank him for tabling this motion which is extremely pertinent in the context of last week’s revelations about the KPMG affair. That affair is coming back to haunt the <Affiliation DbId="214329" Type="4">Minister of National Revenue</Affiliation>, who had quite a hard time defending herself yesterday in the House over settlements negotiated with tax evaders. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788848">This issue is a priority for the NDP, which is fighting for greater equality and tax fairness. That is why we are debating this motion today. We hope all members of the House will support these measures, which can be taken immediately or in short order to resolve this major problem. I would like to discuss some of the solutions we are proposing to the government. It is my understanding that the government may support our motion, so I am optimistic about convincing it that these short-term measures are feasible. They will help reduce the inequality in our society.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788849">We reserve our harshest criticism for the fact that we have a two-tier tax system. Not only is there an endless array of tax credits, deductions, and exemptions for businesses and the wealthy, but also, if ever the Canada Revenue Agency does catch up with them, they typically negotiate deals to pay back the money they owe to society at preferential interest rates while avoiding penalties and fines that could, at the very least, serve as a warning to others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788850">That is why Canadians are so outraged by what they have seen in the recent reports. It seems as though there is a two-tier system: one for wealthy taxpayers, multimillionaires and billionaires, and another for ordinary taxpayers. If the latter make a mistake, even acting in good faith, or if they fail to report income, the CRA is ruthless and does not hesitate to drag those taxpayers to court, people who may not have the means to defend themselves. Wealthy taxpayers, meanwhile, are offered amnesty deals. They are asked to pay the taxes they should have paid in the first place and are told that all will be forgotten. The slate is wiped clean moving forward for them, and yet, ordinary taxpayers are not given the same advantage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788851">Our motion comes at a time when international tax competition is becoming increasingly fierce. This competition is extremely harmful to tax bases all over the world. This problem is not unique to Canada. The problem of tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance exists around the globe because of certain unscrupulous countries that are contributing to this highly competitive tax environment in which each country tries to have the lowest tax rates and give tax benefits to companies and wealthy taxpayers so that they will do business there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788852">Canada is no exception. In some ways, we play into this competitive tax environment. Many of the tax measures that are in place today are a product of that very environment. Canada grants benefits, deductions here and exemptions there. In the end, only the wealthiest members of our society benefit. If we talk to our neighbours, if we go door to door and ask average taxpayers if they are receiving deductions for dividends, tax credits, or capital gains exemptions, if we ask ordinary people about that, we see that they are not the ones benefitting from these credits. Only the upper class benefits from these measures, which are found within a framework that encourages Canada to compete in a way that is damaging in the long term. We may be making some gains here and there in the short term, but this approach is not productive in the long term because, if all of that money is left in the pockets of the rich, we are not able to provide quality services to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="30">(1030)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4788853">Let us not forget that services are not free. As a society, we collectively decide to pool our resources to achieve our goals, in other words, provide high quality and affordable, even free, services to the entire population. That way, regardless of where a person comes from or their financial situation, they can obtain said services. Take health care, for example. We want health care to be provided to everyone, independently of their income. We want everyone to have access to an education without having to spend a fortune on it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788854">My philosophy is that we should pool our efforts and money to provide our fellow citizens with the best services at the best possible cost. Tax competition is causing us to lose more and more means to provide services. Governments are forced to cut more and more from services or increase prices, which is really unfortunate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788855">That is why we are focusing on a few solutions. Among other things, the government needs to tighten the rules around shell companies. How many shell companies are in tax havens that are actively part of this tax competition? How many shell companies are being used only to report profits offshore?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788856">It is one of our society's biggest problems. Real economic activity takes place here, in Canada, or in other industrialized countries, where consumers live. The consumers are not in Barbados, but in Canada, the United States, and Europe. Even though the economic activity takes place in these countries, the profits are reported elsewhere, with different schemes that are increasingly complex. Over the years, the OECD and the government have worked together to address tax schemes. In our opinion, the profits should be reported where the economic activities take place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788857">Accordingly, if the economic activities take place in Canada, then the Canadian subsidiary must pay its taxes in Canada. That is currently not the case. That is why the motion mentions shell companies. We must tighten the rules for these companies. There is work being done on this. We have to tighten the rules in order to ensure that companies report their profits where the economic activity really takes place and not in countries where taxes are low.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788858"> Tax treaties are another issue. Since my colleague has talked about this, I will not go on at length about the subject. In some cases, tax treaties have legalized non-taxation. The goal was to do something good by not taxing the same income twice. For example, if a Canadian company does business in the United States through an American subsidiary and the subsidiary pays taxes at a higher rate than in Canada and then repatriates its profits for its Canadian shareholders, obviously that will not be taxed twice; we are not crazy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788859"> However, double taxation agreements have been signed with countries that have a low or non-existent tax rate; Barbados is the best example of this. There is a good reason why billions of dollars in foreign investment are finding their way to Barbados. Barbados is second on the list of countries where Canada makes the most foreign investments. As I said earlier, that is certainly not where the consumers are, and that is not where real business is being done. That is where the profits are reported, and that is where billions of dollars are sent every year. In Barbados, the tax rate is between 0.25% and 2%. Canada and Barbados have a double taxation agreement. My colleague provided more details on this subject a little earlier.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788860"> We are asking that the government examine this question, to ensure that double taxation agreements are not being abused. In this case, there has certainly been abuse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788861"> We must make every effort to create something that is not a two-tier system. This is a major problem that Canadians condemn. In the KPMG case, agreements were signed and settlements negotiated. It was told that its slate would be wiped clean if it paid the tax owed. It was decided that all would be forgotten.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788862"> It is not too late for the government to file criminal charges in the case of KPMG, which facilitates tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance, and against the clients who participated in this scheme. In fact, that is what I asked the <Affiliation DbId="214329" Type="4">Minister of National Revenue</Affiliation> to do, yesterday. That would allow for exemplary sentences to be imposed, and it would show others what happens when you engage in tax evasion. We hope that will mean we can put an end to this scourge in our society.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4788866"> We completely support additional investments. During the Conservatives’ term in office, we asked that they reinvest in the Canada Revenue Agency. We made very frequent requests for hiring more auditors. Unfortunately, the Conservatives reduced investment instead. Fortunately, $444 million has now been invested. For the moment, my colleague is the very person who tables the government’s answers to questions on the Order Paper. If I look at the recent figures we have, dated today, with the new international investigations branch that was created on April 1, 2006, 56 investigations have been opened, but none has yet been sent to the Public Prosecution Service of Canada. We have therefore seen no results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788867"> If we take the case of the Panama Papers, more than 397 individuals had been identified on the date when my question was answered, including 50 companies and 80 individuals. How many of those cases were referred to the criminal investigations program, the step before prosecutions? None. This is not moving fast enough. Canadians are outraged by this situation, and the government keeps saying that it is investing money. However, we are not seeing any results. It is all very well to keep up the fine talk, as the minister has done with her pink cards, but if there are no results at the end of the line and if no white-collar criminals are convicted in the Canadian courts or in the criminal courts, these are not positive outcomes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788868"> I support these additional investments, but I am anxious to see concrete results and people who are actually in handcuffs for tax fraud and tax evasion. That is not what we have seen, however, and it is not what we are seeing. I hope it comes to pass.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4788870">Mr. Speaker, I am happy to answer that question. I alluded to it in my speech. The tax treaties are double taxation treaties, among others. The most telling example, which was even raised by the Bloc Québécois in the past, was the one signed with Barbados in the 1980s, under a certain Minister of Finance, Mr. Martin—I do not know whether that tells you something—who perhaps had interests, even personal interests, at the time this double taxation agreement was signed, because he himself had companies in the country with which the treaty was signed, namely Barbados.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788871">That is the classic case, the most telling example, where we have a double taxation treaty with a country that has a low or non-existent tax rate. That is the major problem. That is why, in the recent debate on double taxation concerning the Canada and Taiwan Territories Tax Arrangement and the Convention between Canada and the State of Israel, which have been renewed, I implored the government to monitor our double taxation conventions very closely, to assess whether the tax rates in the countries concerned were reasonable and whether they would allow Canadians to see that everything was as fair as it should be and that these conventions being signed with many other countries were not being abused. There are over 90 treaties at present. I gave the example of the convention with Barbados; it is high time that we terminated that convention, which is being abused, and look to see whether there are others being abused and terminate them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4788872">Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="214102" Type="2">Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie</Affiliation> for moving this motion today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788873">I am pleased to address the issue raised by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214102" Type="2">Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie</Affiliation>. I would like to state unequivocally that the Government of Canada is committed to ensuring that the tax system is fair to the middle class. We believe that Canadians must pay their fair share of taxes. That is why, after our government came into office in fall 2015, one of our first actions was to increase taxes for the wealthiest Canadians in order to reduce taxes for the middle class.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788874">Specifically, the government reduced the second personal income tax rate to 20.5% from 22%. In addition, only those individuals earning the highest incomes in Canada, or the richest 1%, should pay more taxes after the introduction of the new 33% tax rate for individuals earning over $200,000. Since January 1, 2016, nearly nine million Canadians have seen more money in their pockets as a result of the middle-class tax cut. Not only was this a good thing to do, but it was also the intelligent thing to do for our economy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788875"> The tax cut for the middle class and the measures that go with it have helped make the tax system fairer to ensure that Canadians can succeed and prosper in their lives. Single individuals who benefit from the reduced second personal income tax rate will see an average tax reduction of $330 per year, while couples will see an average tax reduction of $540 per year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788876"> At the same time, the government returned the tax-free savings account, or TFSA, annual contribution limit to $5,500 from $10,000, effective January 1, 2016. Returning the TFSA annual contribution limit to $5,500 was in line with the government’s objective of making the tax system fairer and helping those who need it the most. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788877">When other registered savings plans are taken into account, the $5,500 contribution limit will enable most taxpayers to meet their ongoing savings needs in a tax-efficient manner. Furthermore, indexation of the TFSA annual contribution limit was reinstated so that the amount will retain its real value over time.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788878"> We have also taken action to improve the child benefit that Canadians receive. In our 2016 budget, we implemented the Canada child benefit, which is completely tax-free, in addition to being simpler and more generous than the old benefit system it replaced.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788879"> It also does a better job than the previous system of targeting the people who most need it. I firmly believe that the many parents who receive this greatly needed assistance agree with me. Thanks to the introduction of a much better-targeted Canada child benefit, about 300,000 fewer children will be living in poverty in 2017, as compared to 2014. This represents a nearly 40% drop in the child poverty rate since 2014.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788880"> Since the Canada child benefit was introduced in July 2016, nine out of ten families are now receiving more money than they did under the previous system, or nearly $2,300 more on average in 2016-17. Parents with children under 18 will receive annually up to $6,400 more per child under age 6 and $5,400 more per child aged 6 to 17. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788881"> Whether these additional funds are used for things like buying school supplies, covering part of the family grocery bill, or buying warm coats for winter, the Canada child benefit helps parents cover the high cost of raising their children.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4788882">As announced in budget 2016, the government is currently conducting a comprehensive review of the federal tax expenditures. It is doing so in recognition of concerns that have been expressed regarding the efficiency, fairness, and complexity of the tax system. The objective of this review is to ensure that federal tax expenditures are fair for Canadians, efficient, and fiscally responsible for all. External experts have been engaged to provide advice to the Department of Finance. This approach ensures the review is informed by a range of perspectives.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788883"> I can assure all hon. members that the government remains committed to ensuring federal tax expenditures are doing what they are meant to do and that they are doing it to help middle-class Canadians. In addition, the government is committed to strengthening efforts to combat international tax evasion and avoidance, and we have taken, and will continue to take, this important step and actions to do so.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788884">These efforts help protect the revenues base and give Canadians greater confidence that the system is fair for everyone. Canadians work hard for their money, and the majority of Canadians pay their fair share of taxes. However, some wealthy individuals participate in complex tax schemes to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. This is unacceptable, and it needs to change.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788885">The Government of Canada is working hard to crack down on offshore tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance in order to ensure a tax system that is fair and responsive for all Canadians. In budget 2016, we invested $444 million over five years for the Canada Revenue Agency, better known as the CRA, to crack down on international tax evasion and combat tax avoidance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788886">These investments by the government are enabling the CRA to hire additional auditors, develop robust business intelligence infrastructure, increase verification activities, and improve the quality of its investigative work. These new investments to support the CRA's effort to crack down on tax evasion and combat tax avoidance are expected to generate around $2.6 billion in taxes over the next five years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788887">In April 2016, the offshore compliance advisory committee was created to advise the <Affiliation DbId="214329" Type="4">Minister of National Revenue</Affiliation> and the CRA on strategies to combat offshore tax evasion and avoidance. However, we also recognize that assessing tax revenues alone is not enough. Once we do an assessment, we need to be able to collect the unpaid amounts. That is why budget 2016 invests an additional $351.6 million over five years to improve CRA's ability to collect these outstanding tax debts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788888">Canada has been a very active participant in international efforts to address tax evasion. Canada is an active member of the Global Forum which was established to ensure that high standards of transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes are in place around the world. Canada has developed an extensive network of bilateral tax treaties and tax information exchange agreements which provide for the exchange of information that could be extremely critical in investigation processes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788889">Another international development with regard to addressing tax evasion is the new common reporting standard developed by the OECD and endorsed by the G20 leaders. The standard provides a framework under which information on financial accounts in a country held by non-residents will be automatically shared with tax authorities of the jurisdiction in which the account holder is a resident.

BEPS refers to aggressive international tax-planning arrangements undertaken by some multinational enterprises to inappropriately minimize their taxes. Budget 2016 announced a series of actions Canada is taking to implement recommendations from the BEPS project. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4788891">First, Canada has enacted new legislation to require country-by-country reporting for large multinational enterprises. Second, the CRA is applying revised international guidance on transfer pricing. Third, we participated in international work that developed a multilateral instrument to streamline the implementation of treaty-related BEPS recommendations, including addressing treaty abuse. Finally, the CRA is undertaking a spontaneous exchange with other jurisdictions of certain tax rulings.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788892">Going forward, the government will continue to work with the international community to ensure a coherent and consistent response to the BEPS. The government is also taking action in other areas to protect the integrity of Canada's international tax rules. In particular, budget 2016 introduced measures to extend the application of the income tax back-to-back loan rule to royalty arrangements, and to prevent unintended tax-free cross-border distributions of capital to non-residents.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4788896"> Last June, the government reached a historic agreement with the provincial governments to improve the Canada pension plan. This agreement followed a review conducted by the Department of Finance to determine whether families approaching retirement were adequately prepared for retirement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788897"> Finance department officials found that around one in four families approaching retirement, namely 1.1 million families, may not save enough to maintain their current standard of living. This is very troubling. Middle-income families are the most at risk. Families with no workplace pension plans are at an even greater risk of not saving enough for retirement. In fact, a third of those families are at risk.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788898"> The government is aware of the need to help Canadians invest more. Armed with a higher level of savings, they would be able to more confidently envision their future and their ability to enjoy their retirement years with dignity. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788899">Our government is particularly concerned about the situation of young Canadians, who are likely to be more exposed to market risks and, in most cases, will live longer than previous generations. Young people are faced with the challenge of trying to save enough money for retirement at a time when fewer of them can expect jobs that come with a workplace pension plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788900"> In short, the actions that our government has taken reflect our commitment to helping the middle class and those working very hard to join it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788901"> In this context, the government firmly believes that the best way to increase prosperity for more Canadians is to invest in today's economy. This is why the government has made targeted investments totalling $50.2 billion over six years as part of budget 2016. These investments will ensure stronger growth right now and increase the long-term growth potential of the Canadian economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788902"> We have forged ahead in the knowledge that when Canadians achieve their full potential they can build a better life for themselves, their families, and entire communities. In doing so, they are building a better and stronger Canada for current and future generations.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4788903">As Canada's population ages, our prosperity will increasingly depend on young Canadians getting the education and training they need to prepare them for the jobs of today and tomorrow. That is why, in budget 2016, we increased the Canada student grant amounts for students from low- and middle-income families, as well as part-time students. As a result, more than 360,000 students across Canada will receive more assistance to pursue their education.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788904"> We are also working with provinces and territories to expand eligibility for Canada student grants, so that even more students can receive non-repayable assistance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788905">What is more, under the youth employment strategy, the government invests more than $330 million each year to help young people gain the skills and experience they require to find jobs. Our government has taken action to build on this investment and strengthen the youth employment strategy with an additional investment of $165.4 million in 2016 and 2017. These investments will increase the number of youth who can access the skills link program, which helps young Canadians overcome barriers to employment. It will also create new green jobs for youth and help support employment opportunities in the heritage sector.</ParaText>

One is that it can toughen up the government procurement rules so that it would not have to actually achieve a conviction for tax evasion, a criminal offence, so it could ban those who undertake serious tax evasion from further procurement or contracts with the government.

When we look at last year's budget and what it was able to accomplish, it is very easy to draw the conclusion that this is a government that is all about tax fairness, whether it is a special tax that has been assigned to Canada's wealthiest, a tax break that has been given to the middle class, or in fact the $444 million to which the member has made reference in terms of trying to get to the core issues dealing with tax evasion. However, if we look at it from a holistic approach, we see the government is in fact moving forward on a number of files, including tax evasion.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4788925">Absolutely, Mr. Speaker, I agree completely with the question and the premise of the question. Our government has made a commitment to Canadians that middle-class Canadians and those working hard to join them are our priority, and we are going to continue to make them our priority. In budget 2016, we saw some clear programs that illustrated our support for middle-class Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788926">The first of those programs, as I mentioned in my speech earlier today, was the reduction of taxes for middle-class Canadians from 22% to 20.5%. It allowed many Canadians to have more money in their pockets, to spend more money, and to invest into the economy and again to stimulate that economy. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788927">The other program that I am very proud of, as well, is the historic investment we have made with the Canada child benefit program. The Canada child benefit program has lifted hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty, and it has made a clear difference in the lives of many Canadian families. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788928">When it comes to our seniors, we have made again some significant investments to help the lives of our seniors. That is another measure that we took to help the middle class.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788929">Finally with respect to the amount of money we have put in place with respect to the bill that is before us, the $444 million that has been put in place to help address the issue of tax evasion, we want to make sure Canadians are paying their fair share of taxes. That being said, as I have said time and again, most Canadians are paying their fair share of taxes; but for the ones who are not, we certainly want to make sure we have the processes in place to get the job done and also that those individuals can be prosecuted and receive the appropriate penalties.</ParaText>

I will be voting to oppose this motion. I will say that I would have preferred to support it and vote for it, as many of the principles it speaks to I support. I must also point out that the Conservative Party of Canada believes strongly in keeping taxes low, much as it also believes in ensuring that all corporations and Canadians need to pay their fair share of tax.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788938">While this motion rightly seeks to reduce offshore tax evasion, it avoids one of the root causes of the problem, and that is too many taxes. We know that high taxes drive businesses out of the country and dampen Canada's entrepreneurial spirit. We know that high taxes hurt job creation by making it more difficult to start and run a business. We know that high taxes hurt Canadian families that are trying to build a brighter future for their children.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788939">If we want to stop driving families and businesses out of this great country, we need to start by lowering taxes to make Canada more welcoming to them, yet it would seem that the government is doing precisely the opposite. Instead of looking at ways to foster entrepreneurship and business growth, the government is desperately looking for new ways to bring in more money to pay for its reckless and irresponsible spending. We have seen a report from Bloomberg pointing out that business investment in this country has fallen to the lowest level since 1981, and, depending on the statistics, we have seen low grades of investment since World War II. Therefore, this is an issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788940">The government has failed to follow through on its promise to cut taxes for small businesses. Next it rolled back important tax cuts for Canadians, including the popular fitness and children's arts tax credits. Recently it started looking at whether to tax health and dental benefits. It is clear that the government just does not get it. It plans to make life more expensive for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788941">The Conservative Party will fight to make life more affordable, not less. When the Conservative government was in power, it was Prime Minister Stephen Harper who fought to do exactly that. Conservatives understood the value of low taxes and the importance of fighting tax evasion. A pragmatic and balanced policy would achieve both goals. For example, in economic action plan 2013, the Conservative government introduced a number of measures designed to deal with tax evasion, including requiring financial intermediaries, including banks, to report international electronic fund transfers of $10,000 or more to the CRA; extending the normal reassessment period by three years for taxpayers who have failed to report income from a specified foreign property on their annual income tax returns and have failed to properly file the foreign income verification statement; revising form T1135 reporting to provide more detailed information, including the names of specific foreign institutions and countries where offshore assets are located and the foreign income earned on those assets; and streamlining the process for the Canada Revenue Agency to obtain information concerning unnamed persons from third parties, such as banks. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788942">Conservatives also launched the international tax evasion program aimed at reducing international tax evasion and avoidance. Under this program, the CRA would pay rewards to individuals with knowledge of major international tax non-compliance when they provided information to the CRA that led to the collection of outstanding taxes due. This program helped target high-income taxpayers attempting to evade or avoid tax using complex international arrangements. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788943">Economic action plan 2015 built on these measures and announced an additional $25.3 million over five years to expand its activities to combat international tax evasion, and $58.2 million over five years to specifically deal with large and complex business entities that were undertaking tax evasion. I would note that the <Affiliation DbId="229486" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance</Affiliation> has mentioned some of the investments the government makes, which shows that there are progressive efforts to curb tax evasion in this country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4788944">These measures help make sure that every Canadian pays their fair share. In fact, between 2006 and 2015, the Conservative government aggressively moved to close more than 85 tax loopholes. Closing these loopholes amounted to billions of dollars saved annually. That meant lower taxes for all Canadians, not just a select few.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788945"> It is not just us who believe that these measures have helped. In the fall of 2013, when the Auditor General conducted a review of offshore banking, it was concluded that CRA was diligent and that the new measures were helping. Our plan worked on this very issue and is continuing to help CRA crack down on tax evaders. We will continue to advocate that the Liberal government consistently review how it can best address the problem. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788946">Beyond taking direct action to combat international tax evasion, the Conservative Party also took steps to encourage new investment to come to Canada by building a tax-friendly environment for businesses. Conservatives understand that we need to be tough on tax cheaters while also making sure that our tax system is not driving people away. That is why we introduced a number of measures that reduced the overall tax burden in Canada to its lowest level in 50 years. In fact, the Conservative government cut taxes more than 180 times. That is because we do not simply say we will do something; we follow through with those commitments we make to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788947">Our record on taxes is clear. We lowered the federal corporate income tax rate to 15% to help create jobs and economic growth for Canadian communities. We lowered the small business tax rate. We introduced a small business job credit, which lowered payroll taxes by 15% for small businesses. We also cut the red tape burden for businesses, which eliminated more than 800,000 payroll deduction remittances to CRA made every year by over 50,000 small businesses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788948">All these measures and more led Bloomberg to rank Canada the second most attractive country in the world in which to start and grow a business. In fact, across the G7, Canada had the lowest overall tax rate on new business investment. By cracking down on tax evaders and lowering taxes and tax burdens for businesses, the Conservative Party introduced the kind of balanced approach needed to foster a fair and friendly system. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788949">It is important to note that the NDP voted against every single small business tax cut we introduced between 2006 and 2015. I ask my hon. colleague why he does not put forward a motion that both targets tax evasion and lowers the tax burden for Canadian businesses. That is the sort of policy I want to see from the government: a pragmatic, balanced approach that will lower taxes rather than raise them and that will continue to build on the strong work done by the previous government to crack down on tax evasion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788950"> It is critically important that we target Canadian tax evaders, absolutely. Certainly, I believe that all members in this place would agree on the importance of cracking down on international tax evasion. However, we must also fight to lower taxes to help spur job creation and economic growth and to keep Canada competitive with other jurisdictions. By doing this, we will save money for the Canadian taxpayer and work to make Canada the best place in the world to start and grow a business.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788951">There are so many things we can do to make us more competitive so that business investment comes into this great country, such as interprovincial trade and lowering our regulatory burden, things that down south, the new administration is currently looking to do.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788952">While I appreciate where the NDP members are coming from on this, I am sure that they would understand where I am coming from. Again, this is a fine country. I welcome debate on any topic a member of Parliament believes needs to be heard. We need to do more in the area of lowering taxes, coupled with the efforts we continue on tax evasion, so that overall, we can bring more prosperity to this country and curb illegal activities.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4788970">Mr. Speaker, no one stands more firmly against tax evasion than the Conservative Party of Canada. We believe all taxpayers should pay what they owe in taxes, and there should be no special treatment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788971"> The Conservative Party believes in keeping taxes low for all Canadians, but we also believe in ensuring that all corporations and individuals pay their fair share of tax. We are committed to lower taxes for all Canadians, not just a select few. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788972">The previous Conservative government had a strong record of standing up to international tax avoidance. To enhance the integrity of the tax system, the Conservatives created the stop international tax evasion program, aimed at reducing international tax evasion and avoidance. We remain committed to addressing the issue of international tax evasion and avoidance and will continue to advocate for Canadian taxpayers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788973">Under the leadership of Prime Minister Harper, the government moved aggressively to close more than 85 tax loopholes, which saved the government and the taxpayers of Canada billions of dollars annually. However, I do have some concerns about the motion, which does not seem to take into account the structure of our tax system.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788974">I think that it is offensive to Canadian taxpayers to suggest that those who take advantage of legitimate deductions and exemptions should be lumped in with those who are evading taxes by hiding money offshore. Certainly, those people who are able to claim, for example, the children's fitness tax credit or the arts tax credit, which were cancelled by the current government, were only trying to do what was best for their families. They used the deductions allowed them by law. I can only conclude that the hon. member who sponsored this motion does not understand that tax deductions are available to all Canadians. They are part of making the taxation system fair for all. They are not something offered to benefit the ultra wealthy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788975">No one disputes that tax evasion is a problem, whether it is $7 billion annually or $70 billion, but the hon. member cannot say for certain, as the number is only an educated guess. However, it is important to remember that we in the House are responsible for the laws and regulations of the taxation system. If there are loopholes, deductions, and exemptions, we have only ourselves to blame. It is not fair to blame the taxpayer for taking advantage of what they are legally entitled to, and I stress the word “legally” in this matter.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788976">By all means, we should prosecute those who are breaking the law by avoiding paying taxes. However, given the spending habits of the current government, I applaud those who use legal means to keep money in their own pockets rather than hand it over to a pack of fiscally irresponsible spendthrifts who do not seem to understand that tax money is not theirs but given to them by Canadians in trust. Taxpayers expect and deserve wise stewardship from politicians, not $800,000 office renovations. No wonder people resent having to pay taxes when they see things like that happening.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788977">The motion calls on the government to address tax measures that primarily benefit the wealthy, which seems reasonable enough. After all, we all know who the wealthy are. They are anyone who has more money than I do. That they may have earned their money through hard work and innovation would seem to be irrelevant. It is assumed by some that those they consider wealthy should be paying more, even though we talk about treating all taxpayers fairly and equally. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4788978">Perhaps a case can be made that those who have more should pay more, but I do not see the case being made in this motion. Indeed, we already have different tax brackets in Canada. The wealthy are already paying more. Therefore, exactly what measures does the motion address? We are left to speculate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788979">The government is also told that it should take aggressive action to tackle tax havens. The how and why is left to the imagination. I believe that if we have a fair taxation system, there will not be the same incentive there is now for those who know how to shelter their money offshore. When people do not believe the taxation system is fair, when people do not believe the government spends tax revenue wisely, it is very tempting to look for ways to keep their money out of the hands of the taxman. What we need is a government that understands that budgets do not balance themselves, a government that does not pile things like a carbon tax on hard-working Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788980">The motion calls on the government to tighten rules for shell companies. Once again, there is no definition to be found here. It is assumed we are in agreement that shell companies need additional rules and regulations, but there is no rationale set forth in the motion. We have to take the hon. member's word that this is a problem. I do not see any suggestion of illegality here, just a call for something to be done.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788981">The government is also told to renegotiate tax treaties that let companies repatriate profits from tax havens to Canada tax-free.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788982">I do not think I was in the House when those treaties were approved by Parliament, but I cannot say for certain as the motion does not say which treaties should be renegotiated. I can only assume the government is supposed to know these things, perhaps through mind reading. Nor do I know why the treaties were negotiated to allow tax-free profit taking. There was probably a good reason at that time. The House can of course change its mind if it feels a mistake was made in the past.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788983">What I do know is that renegotiating treaties carries certain risks. There has been a lot of publicity recently about politicians who want to renegotiate certain treaties. The implication is that there are winners in such negotiations and there are losers. There is not always equal treatment. If we ask to reopen a treaty, while Canada may have a certain goal in mind, that goal may not be shared by the other country or countries. We might find, after renegotiation, that there is less benefit to Canada than there is now. However, I am only speculating as there are no details here. We are just supposed to know what the bad deals are.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788984">I understand why people are in favour of dropping the penalty-free amnesty deals for people suspected of tax evasion. Canadians are naturally upset when they hear someone has managed to avoid being penalized for tax evasion. It does not seem fair somehow. I suspect the hon. member who brought this motion forward had a particular highly-publicized case in mind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788985">The Canada Revenue Agency operates independently, free of political interference. This sounds to me like we politicians are trying to tell it how to do its job, when we may not know the details of what and why it does something.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4788986">As I understand it, the lack of prosecution in recently publicized cases was not a matter of special treatment, but standard procedure when people come forward and voluntarily disclose that they may owe money that was previously undeclared. To encourage such disclosure, the CRA waives penalties. That was not the case with CRA auditors finding wrongdoing. The money might never have been collected if the individuals had not come forward. The CRA might never have realized what it was owed. Therefore, while the idea of amnesty is offensive to hard-working Canadians who pay their taxes in full and on time, there are those who can make a credible case to defend the process. Removing voluntary disclosure, which seems to me to be what is being asked here, could conceivably lead to less tax being collected, not more.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789005">Unfortunately, loopholes and tax exemptions still exist today. In fact, there have never been so many. Most working men and women cannot rely on these loopholes, tax deductions, tax exemptions or tax credits. It is very difficult for Canadians to accept that the government is not doing its part to ensure that fraudsters are prosecuted and pay their fair share of taxes like anyone else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789006">For example, the highest-paid CEOs in Canada earn the annual salary of an average worker in half a day. Other statistics show that Canada's highest-paid CEOs earn 193 times the average Canadian salary. It is truly insulting that nothing is being done to ensure that people pay their fair share of taxes, to redistribute the money and to realize our vision of society, which involves access for every citizen to, for instance, quality education and a quality health care system that is not two-tiered.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789007">Canadian seniors have worked hard throughout their lives, and they must be given a decent retirement, which they don't all have. In the riding of Salaberry—Suroît, as in all other ridings, some people cannot eat fruits and vegetables every day, which is not right in a country as wealthy as Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789008">The wealthiest Canadians do not need tax exemptions to live. Unfortunately, the Liberals are maintaining tax loopholes that benefit the wealthiest, while most Canadians are left out. Alain Deneault calls it fiscal haemorrhage. He raises the fact that the corporate tax rate has gone from 38% in 1981 to 15% today. I would like to point out that citizens pay between 15% and 33% in federal tax. Many of them pay more taxes than multinationals and large companies. Mr. Deneault also criticized the fact that companies contribute very little to the financing of public services, whereas they benefit, for example, from high-performance infrastructures and a highly skilled workforce.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789009">The privileged are benefiting from not just one advantageous tax measure. In fact, there are 64, of which five are considered progressive and 59 are considered regressive. By “regressive measures” we mean measures that benefit the wealthiest half of the country instead of the least fortunate half of the country. There are 59 tax measures benefiting the wealthiest half of Canadians. That defies reason; these measures cannot be described as fair or socially just. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789010">In 2011, Canada's lost tax revenues were greater than $100 billion, or roughly 40% of the total federal budget.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="40">(1140)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4789011">Instead of benefiting Canadians who have a hard time making ends meet, that money is staying toasty warm in paradise in places like the Virgin Islands, the Bahamas, and several other countries that have already been mentioned. A little later I will explain the purpose of these countries, these tax loopholes, or tax havens as they are called.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789012">The government should not gear its policy to the wealthiest 1% of society, but to all Canadians. The priority should be affordable housing, public services, and education, as I have said and as many of my colleagues have said many times in their speeches.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789013">During the 2011 and 2015 election campaigns, the Liberals were committed to closing tax loopholes involving stock options. The CEOs of the 60 largest publicly-traded companies in Canada receive roughly 25% of their pay in stock options. Stock options are widely used because they are taxed at half the rate of regular income. As such, a 50% reduction is given to those who can afford stock options, so the CEOs, who are already the wealthiest. Initially, they were meant to benefit small and medium-sized start-up businesses, but it quickly became apparent that they were only benefitting the wealthiest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789014">The Liberals have clearly failed to take action on this issue. They led Canadians to believe that they would bring real change, but instead they maintained the Conservative policy, which they had previously criticized. We know that Bay Street CEOs led a campaign appealing to the current government to preserve their tax benefits. The Liberals are not doing anything to combat poverty, and instead, are working hard to protect the fortunes of the wealthy. This flip-flop is unacceptable for the workers who cannot afford to pay their taxes. Our motion calls on the government to keep its election promises and close the stock option loophole.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789015">In addition to the tax benefits they enjoy in Canada, some wealthy people engage in tax evasion, which is illegal. The Quebec government alone estimates that tax evasion accounts for $3.9 billion in lost revenue. For 2016, the Conference Board estimates that Canada lost $47 billion in tax revenues.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789016">To avoid paying their fair share of taxes, businesses and wealthy individuals can hide their money in tax havens, which are countries that have a low- or even no-tax policy for corporations. Canadian firms sheltered $160 billion in 2011 alone in the Cayman Islands, Barbados, and other such countries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789017">That has been made possible by bilateral tax agreements between Canada and 92 countries. Among these 92 countries, some, such as Barbados, have a tax rate between 0.25% and 2%, whereas in Canada companies are supposed to be taxed at 15%. These companies, which conduct absolutely no economic activities in Barbados, the Cayman Islands, or elsewhere, use these countries in order to not pay too much tax and then send their money to Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789018">We have repeatedly asked successive governments, and now the Liberal government, to take action and to review this type of bilateral agreement with countries where there are abuses and where there may be fraud and tax avoidance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789019">This phenomenon is becoming more prevalent. According to a study by the Institut de recherche en économie contemporaine, the amount of financial assets transferred from Canada to the seven top tax havens in the world was 37 times greater in 2014 than in 1987. The use of foreign tax havens is at an all-time high.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789020">Canada is less engaged than the other G7 countries in the fight against tax havens. The Conservatives cut 3,000 Canada Revenue Agency employees responsible for uncovering tax evasion, and the Liberals have not replaced them. These were highly qualified auditors and managers. It has been shown that, for every dollar invested in tackling tax evasion, taxpayers get $10 in return. It is well worth our while to address this problem.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789021">The Liberals keep saying that they have invested $444 million in the Canada Revenue Agency, but we have not seen any results. There have not been any criminal investigations. Absolutely nothing has changed. I will continue by taking questions.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789034">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in this House to support the motion tabled by my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214102" Type="2">Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie</Affiliation>. The motion calls on the government to close the loopholes on tax havens and to crack down on tax evasions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789035"> Why is this motion so important? Decade after decade vital public services are left underfunded, ignored, or even cancelled. Far too often, the justification for the inaction or cuts in programming is that we cannot afford it. Oddly enough, the affordability question is only asked when we are talking about investments in support of social programs. It never seems to get asked when it comes to providing lucrative tax credits for the wealthy or the continual slashing of corporate taxes or maintaining costly and inefficient tax expenditures that only apply to the highest earners in the country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789036"> Successive governments, Liberals and Conservatives alternating, have chosen to allow these oh so splendid tax loopholes that benefit Canada's wealthiest to continue. For the Liberals and Conservatives, these tax giveaways for the elite are never questioned. For them it is a standard practice. Why? It is in their DNA. Election cycle after election cycle, it is the same old story. Even when they pretend that it is an issue they are concerned about and they campaign on clamping down on these ludicrous tax loopholes, for example, as even written in the Liberals' platform, after the election, boom, it is as though someone waved a magic wand and that promise disappeared. It is gone. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789037">In the most recent election, the Liberals thought that the employee stock option deduction was disproportionately benefiting the very wealthiest Canadians at the expense of everyone else, and of course they were right about that. The Liberals specifically noted in both their 2011 and 2015 election platforms that 8,000 Canadians with very high incomes were deducting an average of $400,000 from their taxable income through these stock options. This represents 75% of the fiscal impact of this deduction, which in total cost $750 million in 2014. The Liberals proposed changes to this tax loophole to raise an additional $560 million for the government's coffers that could have been put into use for public services. Then, in March 2016, just months after the election, when the Liberal government was asked what it was going to do and whether it would follow through on the promised changes to crack down on this lavish tax loophole for the ultra-wealthy, the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> stated, “It's not in our plans.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789038"> What happened, we might ask. Documents obtained under access to information show a direct correspondence between CEOs and the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> pressuring him in advance of the 2016 budget to backtrack on that promise, and guess what. The corporate elites got exactly what they wanted, a $560-million gift courtesy of the Liberal government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789039"> According to a CCPA report, roughly 99% of this money is given to the highest 10% of income earners in Canada. In fact, the study found, “In essence, there is no benefit from this tax expenditure to anyone making less than $215,000 a year.” While this loophole might have originally been designed to help raise money for start-ups and expansions, it is now primarily used by Canada's ultra-rich to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. In case members are wondering, Canada's top CEOs now make 193 times the average Canadian's salary. In fact, Canada's richest CEOs made the average Canadian's annual salary before lunchtime on the first day of work this year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789040">The heads of Canada's five big banks own $6 million in stock options. Is there a real reason for these individuals to need preferential tax treatment? Are Canada's big banks at risk of being unable to start up or expand if these loopholes are closed? Are they not making record profits already? </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="00">(1200)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4789041">To be sure, these are the corporate elites, and in the end, no matter what the Liberals say, they always have the interests of these elites at heart. Canadians get conned every time. They want to believe in the Liberals and what they campaigned on, but in the end, frankly, the campaigning Liberals are not the same as the governing Liberals. What they say is not what they do. They just cannot resist the pressure being put on them by the most powerful in this country to leave in place a system which benefits them at the expense of everyone else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789042">If people think these tax giveaways stop with stock option loopholes, they should think again. Over the years, between the Conservatives and the Liberals, Canada's corporate income tax rate has dropped dramatically, from 37% to 15%. Members heard me correctly. That is a 22-point drop. The office of the parliamentary budget officer found that the former Conservative government's corporate tax giveaways cost taxpayers an additional $12 billion every year. That is $12 billion, not $12, not $1,200, but $12 billion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789043">If that is not enough already, recent international headlines, such as the Panama papers and the Canadian-born KPMG tax haven scandal, among others, showed the wealthiest and corporations are increasingly turning to aggressive tax avoidance measures through the use of shell corporations and offshore accounts in tax havens to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. It is estimated that in 2015, Canadian corporations alone stashed almost $40 billion in the top 10 tax haven destinations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789044">From 1988 to 2001, Canadian direct investments in Barbados, a top tax haven destination, increased from $628 million to $23.3 billion, a 3,600% increase. The increased use of these tax havens means Canadian taxpayers are losing $7 billion in taxes each year. That is $7 billion that Canadians will never see invested in much-needed infrastructure programs for hard-working Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789045">It does not stop there. Another big tax giveaway is the dividend gross-up and tax credit. This measure cost taxpayers $4.1 billion per year. By the way, 91% of this money goes to the top 10% of income earners and roughly 50% of that actually goes to the top 1%. Do not forget that the foreign tax credit comes with a price tag of $740 million per year. According to the CCPA's recent study, if we add up all the measures that benefit mostly the wealthy, in 2011 alone, there was more than $100 billon in forgone revenue. That is money that could be invested in critical programs for Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789046">What are some of those critical programs? How about restoring the national affordable housing program that the Liberals axed in 1993? Homelessness exists because we allow it to exist. A 2014 study found that putting Canada on a path to ending homelessness would cost roughly $3.7 billion per year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789047">There was a gathering of concerned citizens bound by one common thread, the desire to end homelessness, on February 25, the third annual Coldest Night of the Year walk for the homeless. In Vancouver, close to 200 people came out to walk on that cold winter night in my riding. Together we raised $50,000 in support of those who are homeless, hungry, and hurting. United across the country, some 118 communities also joined in this annual walk. This event was a clear statement that many Canadians want to see an end to homelessness. Ending homelessness is entirely possible. It is not rocket science. All we need is to close these tax loopholes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789048">What about big corporations? If we closed the tax loopholes for big corporations, we could invest in a much-needed pharmacare program. I have met seniors who are cutting their pills in half so they can stretch out their medications. I have met seniors who are eating pet food to survive each day. We are providing these huge tax giveaways. Why? The government says we cannot afford these other programs. I say yes we can. We should close the loopholes, tax corporations, reinvest the money into communities for the people, so all Canadians can have the benefit of succeeding in our country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789055">Madam Speaker, before I respond to the question, I just want to make sure I correct the record. I think I said the Liberals could reduce taxes. I obviously meant the opposite, that the Liberals need to increase the corporate income tax rate in order to recoup the monies that could be invested into the community. I want to be clear about that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789056">To the member's question, these things are all interrelated, of course. We are talking about tax havens, where the ultra rich can hide their money so they do not have to pay Canadian taxes. We are talking about a corporate income tax that successive governments have reduced over the years, which actually gave a huge windfall. I would call it corporate welfare, frankly; handouts to these big corporations at the expense of Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789057">What we need to do is look at all of these measures in advance of the budget. The budget is coming down, and I would like to see the government do a comprehensive approach and redirect these resources to Canadians who need it. Every Canadian deserves a chance to succeed, and the people who need it the most are not the people who are benefiting from these huge tax loopholes, billions and billions of dollars in tax loopholes. We could invest that money for all Canadians so we can all succeed.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4789058">Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the important issue of tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance brought forward by my colleague the member for <Affiliation DbId="214102" Type="2">Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie</Affiliation>. I will be splitting my time this morning with my friend and colleague the member for <Affiliation DbId="214299" Type="2">Brampton East</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789059">First, let me state unequivocally that the Government of Canada is committed to combatting international tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance. We believe every Canadian must pay his or her fair share of taxes, period. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789060">Last year's budget introduced a number of measures to combat tax evasion and avoidance and to improve compliance, actions that will help ensure that everyone does their share and pays their fair share.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789061">Furthermore, they support the objective of an economy that works for the middle class and not those who seek to skirt our tax laws or otherwise gain an unfair advantage. Tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance by individuals and businesses have a fiscal cost to governments and to taxpayers. They reduce the fairness and integrity of the tax system. They shift the financial burden onto Canada's middle class, while often benefiting those who may be more than capable of paying their own fair share.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789062">This is why our government took decisive action through budget 2016 to crack down on tax evasion and to combat tax avoidance. Budget 2016 invested $444.4 million over five years to enhance the Canada Revenue Agency's assessment capabilities through the hiring of more auditors and specialists who will have the resources needed to undertake more expansive and comprehensive investigative work.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789063">These investments to support CRA's efforts to crack down on tax evasion and combat tax avoidance are expected to generate approximately $2.6 billion in additional taxes over five years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789064">With the benefit of these new resources in the last year, CRA has begun reviewing all taxpayers and certain segments of the population identified as high risk. The agency is using external data and publicly available information to maximize its effort to identify non-compliance. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789065">The CRA has also toughened its response to leaked lists of taxpayers with offshore holdings. For example, with the Panama papers, the CRA has more than 76 taxpayer audits under way, and extensive data is currently being reviewed. The CRA has also executed search warrants, and several criminal investigations involving both participants and facilitators are ongoing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789066">However, we also recognize that assessing tax revenues alone is not enough. Once we do an assessment we need to be able to collect the unpaid amounts and that is why budget 2016 invested an additional $351.6 million over five years to improve CRA's ability to collect these outstanding tax debts. This is revenue we will be investing to help strengthen and grow our middle class.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789067">Indeed, creating an economy that works for the middle class and those working hard to join it is what guided our actions right from the start of our mandate. As one of our first actions in December 2016, we introduced the middle-class tax cut. Nearly nine million Canadians are now benefiting from this measure. Single individuals who benefit are seeing an average tax reduction of $330 every year, and couples who benefit are seeing an average tax reduction of $540 every year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789068">Also with budget 2016, we put more money directly into the pockets of low- and middle-income families through the Canada child benefit, a more generous, tax-free, and better targeted benefit that is lifting hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty. The CCB is giving nine out of 10 families with children more money every month to spend on everything from school supplies, to school clothes, to sports equipment. Families benefiting have seen an average increase in child benefits of almost $2,300 during the 2016-17 benefit year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789069">These actions and others are helping to strengthen and grow the middle class and our economy. However, we also know that more needs to be done. We need to make sure that our tax system functions as intended and that it is fair, effective, and equitable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789070">We will continue to take legislative and other actions on both the international and domestic fronts to ensure that Canada's tax system is fair and works for the middle class.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789071">Globally, Canada has been a very active participant in efforts to address international tax evasion and avoidance. Canada is an active member of the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes, which was established to ensure that high standards of transparency and exchange of information between jurisdictions for tax purposes are in place around the world.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4789072">Canada has also developed an extensive network of bilateral tax treaties and tax information exchange agreements, and it is party to the multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, which provides for exchange of tax information. This allows the CRA to obtain information from foreign tax authorities on Canadian taxpayers' investments and activities in foreign countries that is relevant for Canadian tax purposes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789073">To build on this information sharing, Canada recently adopted legislation to implement the common reporting standard developed by the OECD and endorsed by G20 leaders. Canada is one of more than 100 jurisdictions worldwide that have similarly committed to implement this reporting standard, which provides a framework under which the tax authority in a country will share information, securely and automatically, on the financial accounts held by non-residents in that country with the tax authority of the country in which the account holder is resident. This House has recently passed legislation to implement this standard, starting on July 1 of this taxation year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789074">Canada has also been actively engaged in a second multilateral initiative aimed at addressing base erosion and profit shifting, commonly known as BEPS. This refers to certain tax planning arrangements undertaken by multinationals, which often through legal means exploit the interaction between the tax rules of different countries in order to minimize taxes. Canada has already implemented a number of the BEPS project recommendations, and going forward, the government will continue to work with the international community to ensure a coherent and consistent response to BEPS filing going forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789075">Canada supports the important goal of improving corporate transparency worldwide. The Government of Canada has agreed to international standards developed by the Financial Action Task Force and the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes in support of corporate transparency. The proceeds of crime, money laundering, and terrorist financing regulations include requirements for financial institutions regarding the collection of information on beneficial owners of corporations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789076">Taken together, all of these actions are consistent with the basic principles of fairness that define us as a nation. Canadians should have confidence that their tax system has integrity. This is what tax fairness is all about. By taking action to prevent tax evasion and close tax loopholes, we will improve the fairness and integrity of the tax system, and contribute to fiscal sustainability both at home and abroad. We believe that our plan is the right one to improve the integrity of Canada's tax system.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789077">Madam Speaker, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214080" Type="2">Vaughan—Woodbridge</Affiliation> talked about tax fairness. I appreciate his bringing up that word. We saw tax havens go up from $45 billion in 2011 to over $108 billion in 2015 under the past Conservative government. My concern is that the government is still protecting those tax agreements. Currently, there are legal loopholes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789078"> I hope the member will choose to close those tax loopholes, in fairness to Canadian taxpayers. We have heard a lot of numbers. We hear it is costing us about $7 billion in tax revenue annually. When we look at all of the tax loopholes and all of the different things in our tax system that are benefiting the rich, we hear from some that the number is about $100 billion. However, if we divide the $7 billion by 338 ridings in Canada, that is over $200 million per riding per year. It would actually be almost $3 billion if we took the $100 billion number. I think about what $200 million a year would do for my riding: it would build more affordable housing, it would create all of the sewer and water infrastructure for Port Alberni, Courtenay, Parksville, and Ucluelet in the first year, and it would create opportunities for economic development, and dock replacement. Maybe the member can tell me and his constituents what $200 million a year would do for his riding and his constituents; or even $3 billion a year, if we actually get it right. It would be great to hear what he can tell us he could do.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789080">What I would like to note is the number of actions that we in our government have undertaken to combat tax avoidance and tax evasion. Over the weekend, the <Affiliation DbId="214329" Type="4">Minister of National Revenue</Affiliation> put out a release, which I think everyone should take a look at. When we look at the CRA's domestic offshore audit activities, we see they put our government on a pace to raise assessments by over $13 billion this year. We have increased the number of auditors reviewing offshore tax schemes, promoters, and large multinational corporations. In our budget, we put in place a plan to invest $444 million over five years for increased tax evasion and tax avoidance monitoring.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789082"> Last year, in that plan, about $400 million was announced for going after money that should have been paid to the government.

              <ParaText id="4789087">Madam Speaker, it is always a privilege to rise in this House. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789088">In an uncertain future, our government is working hard to ensure that Canada's economy works for the middle class. We believe that when we have an economy that works for the middle class, we have a country that works for everyone, and that means ensuring everyone pays their fair share of taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789089">Over the last year, our government has done some big things. We were elected on the platform of growing the middle class, and that is exactly what we have been doing. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789090">We started by raising taxes on the wealthiest 1% of Canadians so we could cut taxes for the middle class. Specifically, we reduced the 22% federal income tax rate to 20.5% for 2016 and all subsequent tax years, and we raised the taxes on the wealthiest Canadians by introducing a new top income tax rate of 33% for individuals with a taxable income of over $200,000. As a result, nearly nine million Canadians pay fewer taxes today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789091">In today's economy, Canadian families need all the help they can get. This is why we introduced the Canada child benefit, which is a real game changer. The Canada child benefit is making a real difference in the lives of Canadians and their families' budgets. Compared with the old system under the previous government, the Canada child benefit is simpler, fully tax-free, more generous, and better targeted to those who need it most. Because the government is no longer sending cheques to millionaires, nine out of 10 Canadian families are receiving more child benefits than they did under the previous government. Families benefiting saw an average increase of almost $2,300 per year. On a monthly basis, that is almost $190, on average, that families receive directly into their pockets. That is extra money to help Canadian families pay for school supplies, their children's education, and child care expenses.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789092">Furthermore, on March 2, the final step to strengthening the Canadian pension plan was put into force. This means that strengthening the CPP is no longer an idea, but a reality. This historic agreement between Canada's federal, provincial, and territorial governments will ensure that today's young Canadians will be able to count on a strong public pension plan when they retire in the future. At maturity, the CPP enhancement will increase the maximum CPP retirement benefit by about 50% which, in today's dollars, represents an increase of nearly $7,000 to a maximum benefit of $20,000.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789093">It is evident that we are working hard to deliver real change for Canadians. In that time, significant early progress has been made. However, more hard work lies ahead.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789094">Paying our fair share of taxes is essential to financing the measures that enhance the lives of all Canadians. When certain individuals or corporations find ways to skirt the system, it is the middle class that usually picks up the tab. That is totally unacceptable and counterproductive to our country's goals. That is why making the tax system more fair is an ongoing priority of this government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789095">As announced in budget 2016, the Government of Canada is conducting a comprehensive review of federal tax expenditures. It is doing so in recognition of concerns that have been expressed regarding efficiency, fairness, and the complexity of the tax system. The objective of the review is to ensure that federal tax expenditures are fair for Canadians, are efficient, and are fiscally responsible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789096">External experts have been engaged to provide evidence and advice to the government. This approach ensures that the review is informed by a range of perspectives, both inside and outside government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789097">In addition, the government is committed to strengthening the efforts to combat international tax evasion and avoidance. We have taken, and we will continue to take, measures to do this. These efforts help protect the revenue base and give Canadians greater confidence that the system is fair to everyone.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4789098">Budget 2016 invested $444 million over five years directly into the Canada Revenue Agency to crack down on international tax evasion and combat tax avoidance. This investment is enabling the CRA to hire additional auditors, develop robust business intelligence infrastructure, increase verification activities, and improve the quality of its investigative work. These new investments to support the CRA's efforts to crack down on tax evasion and combat tax avoidance are expected to generate around $2.6 billion in taxes over five years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789099">With the benefit of these new resources, the CRA has set up teams to focus exclusively on promoters of offensive tax schemes. As a result of these new reporting requirements, the CRA has been tracking information on electronic fund transfers over $10,000. Based on the information collected, audits of the highest risk taxpayers moving money between Canada and offshore jurisdictions are under way.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789100">So far, a total of 41,000 transactions have been analyzed, totalling over $12 billion. Overall, the CRA is currently conducting audits of over 820 taxpayers and criminally investigating 20 cases of tax evasion related to offshore accounts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789101">That said, we also recognize that assessing tax revenues alone is not enough. Once we do an assessment, we need to be able to collect the unpaid amounts. That is why budget 2016 invests an additional $351 million over five years to improve the CRA's ability to collect these outstanding tax debts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789102">The Standing Committee on Finance, of which I am a member, tabled a report just last October on the study of tax avoidance and evasion. The report concluded with 14 recommendations to the government, including, but not limited to, the following: conducting a review of the voluntary disclosures program; requiring all tax advisers to register their tax products with the CRA; improve relationships between the CRA and the Department of Justice, which prosecutes these cases of tax evasion; improve statistical reporting requirements at the CRA on their efforts on tax evasion and avoidance, for transparency; and taking a lead in ensuring global implementation of the OECD and Group of 20's recommendations on the issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789103"> Just two weeks ago, the government provided its official response to the report. I am proud to share that in the response, the government affirms its support of all 14 recommendations. Additionally, the government shared the work that has already been done or is currently being undertaken to ensure all Canadians pay their fair share of taxes in our great nation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789104"> Before I conclude, let me emphasize that our government is focused squarely on Canadians and the things that matter most to them. Things like growing the economy, creating jobs, strengthening the middle class, and helping those working hard to join it. Part of this responsibility includes making sure Canada's tax system works for everyone and that we all pay our fair share.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789105">Going forward, we will continue to monitor and strengthen the tax system, so that we can continue to bring real change to the middle class and to all Canadians.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789114">Madam Speaker, my hon. colleague is 100% correct. Over the last 10 years, under the previous Conservative government, the CRA's budget was drastically reduced, and that is why a lot more tax avoidance and tax evasion occurred. The CRA did not have the resources to combat it. Now our government, in its first budget, has invested $444 million, and from that $444-million investment, we are expecting $2.6 billion back in collected unpaid taxes, which will help and strengthen the middle class and bring real change to all Canadians. It will ensure tax fairness for all Canadians from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789122">I am pleased to speak in support of today's opposition day motion, brought forward by my colleague, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214102" Type="2">Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie</Affiliation>. He is also the New Democrats' newly minted finance critic, and I congratulate him on the appointment. Based on the debate he has brought forward today, I know he will do a terrific job as our finance critic.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789123">The motion we are debating today is very straightforward, and I would hope that the Liberal government would support it. It is a two-part motion. It calls on the government to address tax loopholes and to crack down on the use of tax havens. It is about enforcing the basic principle that every Canadian should pay his or her fair share of taxes. It is about tax fairness. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789124">I am not suggesting that the current tax system is the model of fairness, but we know that far too many of the wealthiest Canadians are shirking their responsibility to pay their taxes, and in some cases, are going to extraordinary and even criminal lengths to avoid paying them at all. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789125">A few years ago, Warren Buffett famously claimed that he was paying a lower tax rate in the U.S. than his secretary. It goes to show how many loopholes exist for the wealthiest in society. In Canada, the stats are staggering. Canada's top CEOs earn 193 times the average person's salary. Two Canadian billionaires possess the same amount of wealth as nearly a third of Canadians, $33.1 billion U.S. Canada's richest CEOs earn the same in half a day as the average Canadian worker earns in a year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789126"> What New Democrats are suggesting here today is not radical. All we are saying is that the government needs to tighten up the rules and crack down on these tax loopholes and tax havens that are allowing the super-rich to avoid paying their fair share.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789127">According to the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, there are about 59 tax measures that mostly benefit people above the average income level, which costs the government more than $100 billion in foregone tax revenues. These loopholes significantly undermine the government's ability to provide funding for key priorities, such as improving health care and seniors care, investing in affordable housing and public transit, and even launching an affordable child care system and national pharmacare plan, two ideas that would go far in building a stronger, healthier Canada. I think about what these programs would mean in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="214139" Type="2">Essex</Affiliation>. They would improve the quality of life and the affordability of life for so many families and individuals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789128">In the last election we talked a lot about the stock option deduction loophole. In most of Canada, profit from stock options is considered to be a capital gain and therefore is taxed at half the rate for regular income. Many companies offer stock options to their employees as an incentive in their compensation packages. This tool was initially designed to help raise money for start-ups and expansion, but now it is being primarily used by Canada's wealthiest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789129">Stock options now make up about 25% of CEO compensation at Canada's top 60 publicly traded companies. This costs federal and provincial governments close to $1 billion every year in foregone revenue. The Liberals know this to be true. In 2011 and in 2015, their platforms acknowledged these very facts. Both the New Democrats and the Liberals campaigned on closing the stock option deduction loophole, but here we go again, another promise made by the Liberals that apparently they never meant to keep.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789130">The other week, at the international trade committee, we had the pleasure of hearing from the <Affiliation DbId="214340" Type="4">Minister of Small Business and Tourism</Affiliation>, who discussed what her government is doing to support more small businesses in accessing international markets. I asked her about the Liberals' campaign promise to reduce the small business tax. She referred to it as a great sound bite but said that it was not a good idea anymore. Her comments struck me as very cynical and certainly is not what I am hearing from those in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="214139" Type="2">Essex</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789131">When parties make election promises, such as reforming the electoral system, lowering the small business tax rate, or closing the stock option deduction loophole, Canadians expect the government to deliver, not to turn its back and later scoff at the very premise of these commitments. The Liberals are breaking campaign promises left and right. It is shameful. I am worried that after four years of the Liberal government, Canadians will be even more cynical about politics than they were after 10 years of the Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789132">After promising to fully tax individual stock options exceeding $100,000 during the last election campaign, after forming government the Liberals announced that they will leave it untouched. We have now learned of intense lobbying by Bay Street CEOs, who benefit greatly from this measure, to keep this loophole open.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4789133">Both the Liberals and the Conservatives have now claimed that closing the stock option loophole would hurt small businesses and start-ups, arguing that they would not be able to give employees stock options as an incentive to help companies grow. However, closing the stock option loophole does not mean that companies would not grant stock options as compensation. Start-ups could still offer stock options to attract and retain employees. Those employees would just have to pay fair tax on the income, the same rate normal Canadians pay on their income, rather than receiving a 50% discount.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789134">When we talk about loopholes and tax evasion, we are not talking about Canadians putting their money into RRSPs or TFSAs. We are talking about off-the-book illegal schemes, like the one cooked up by KPMG to hide Canadians' money in offshore accounts.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789135"> The second part of today's motion calls on the government to “take aggressive action to tackle tax havens”. The key word here is “aggressive”. It means “tightening rules for shell companies”. It means “renegotiating tax treaties that let companies repatriate profits from tax havens to Canada tax-free”, and it means “ending penalty-free amnesty deals for individuals suspected of tax evasion”. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789136">This is not just a tax issue. It is about cracking down on white-collar criminals. The government members talk about the size of CRA's budget for going after tax evaders, but we still have not seen any criminal charges. It is clear that the government must do more to tackle tax cheats, who are robbing Canadians of billions of dollars of revenue that is sorely needed to improve our communities. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789137">Canada is lagging behind other G7 countries in tackling tax havens. The previous Conservative government eliminated 3,000 jobs at CRA in the unit responsible for detecting tax evaders, including the jobs of hundreds of auditors and 50 highly trained managers. This is a perfect example of why ideologically driven budget cuts can be so shortsighted. The finance department's own numbers show a $10 return for every dollar invested in combatting international tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance. The Liberal government has made new investments in CRA, which are welcome, but this is not a silver-bullet solution. Instead, it is a starting point in a larger conversation about how we tackle this complex problem.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789138"> I have already talked about many elements of an aggressive, effective strategy to combat tax loopholes and tax havens. Another policy I would like to draw my colleagues' attention to is the impact of drastic cuts to the corporate income tax. The Conservatives cut the rate by one-third, from 22% to 15%, over six years, and the Liberals have kept it at this very low level, which is even lower than the U.S. rate. The parliamentary budget officer has said that these corporate tax giveaways cost the government $12 billion annually. Evidence shows that the Conservatives' drastic cuts have not boosted investment or led to the promised job creation. Again, we have another ideologically driven decision that has not led to economic growth and job creation. It has just been a massive tax giveaway. Its only real impact has been to deplete the government of tax revenues that could be used to build better health care, community infrastructure, and other urgent priorities in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789139">The Liberals promised change for everyday people. They promised policies that would build a fair economy that lifts everyone up, not just those at the top. Canadians are increasingly frustrated that the Liberals are failing to deliver. Instead, we are seeing business as usual. Instead of listening to the voices of everyday Canadians, the Liberals are listening to the loudest voices in the room, the ones of the lobbyists and well-connected insiders who look out for the interests of the wealthiest CEOs and corporations. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789140">As a New Democrat and as the member of Parliament proudly representing Essex, I want to be a voice for the hard-working people who have been left behind by an economy that excludes too many. I want to fight for a Canada that works for everyone, not just the wealthy and the well-connected. Today, New Democrats are calling on the Liberal government to ensure that CEOs and big corporations pay their fair share. I hope all hon. colleagues will join me in voting yes to this motion.</ParaText>

Tax evasion, loopholes, shell companies, and tax havens are tools to avoid paying taxes. For weeks, KPMG has made headline after headline. Every couple of months we hear a similar story, creative money-peddling accountants finding a new way to cheat the system, and millionaires and billionaires finding ways to hide their money. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789159">I want to be really clear. This money is made off the labour of someone. Their profit is at the expense of hard-working people across Canada. This is why ending tax loopholes is so important. We must look at this seriously because it is about the value of the working person. There are so many revelations that sometimes I have the urge to simply not read the articles. It is disheartening when so many people in my riding of North Island—Powell River are struggling hard every day. These stories pop up every couple of months, year after year, and we are still waiting for some real solutions. </ParaText>

Despite this, I still strongly think we cannot give in, that we can slowly and smartly take steps to dismantle these schemes and strengthen our Income Tax Act. This is so important. It is about the hard-working people in Canada who are paying more than their fair share, while rich people, millionaires and billionaires, are hiding their money.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789161">I am so proud that today's motion offers some very specific examples of what Parliament should take very seriously moving forward. One example is the recent deal given to clients of KPMG, which facilitated their tax evasion, that freed them from any future civil or criminal prosecution, as well as any penalties or fines. In my riding, if people owe just a little, they are absolutely paying penalties and fines, even when it hurts them to do so. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789162">The NDP is calling for a full investigation into the KPMG affair. Ending penalty-free amnesty deals for individuals suspected of tax evasion, a gift to wealthy tax evaders and aggressive tax avoiders, should seriously be considered. Enough is enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789163">Another example is changing the corporate tax rules that allow for the use of shell companies, which serve no economic purpose other than to protect the wealth of the ultra rich. It plays an important role in large scale money laundering activities. At the heart of the Panama papers was the law firm Mossack Fonseca, which managed more than 300,000 companies over the years. This is unacceptable.</ParaText>

If even a portion of this sum were recuperated, it could pay for a national pharmacare program, a national child care program, and upholding equal care for first nations children. We are still waiting for that amount of money to be provided for children who are suffering across our country.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789166">Second, budgets are about priorities. In my riding of North Island—Powell River last week, I participated in the Coldest Night of the Year walk. I was tremendously pleased that so many from the community of Campbell River, across the riding, and other communities came and fundraised. They know the reality of people who do not have homes, or do not have appropriate food, or struggle every day just to survive. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789167">It is so important to remember the people who pay their fair share and fight hard just to survive every day when we see what is happening with tax loopholes and tax evasion. I am very keen to take a close look at the proposed measures in due time to ensure fairness, including fiscal fairness, is finally taken seriously. Canadians deserve that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789168">The Liberals have not taken tax fairness very seriously in the past, and it is time to change that. If we take a step back for a moment, we see two parties in the House defending their sad record. They will share vast amounts of numbers, like the amount invested in the Canada Revenue Agency, recapturing funds, along with many fairytales, but Canadians are not fooled by these smokescreens. They know that lost revenue is due to misguided priorities and discarded promises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789169">One of the broken promises has to do with the stock option deduction. After promising during the last election campaign to fully tax individual stock option gains exceeding $100,000, the Liberals announced they would leave it untouched after they formed government. Again, hard-working Canadians are paying their fair share every day. It is only reasonable for us to hold to account those who are not paying their fair share.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789170">We have now learned of intense lobbying by Bay Street CEOs, who benefit greatly from this measure, to keep the loophole open. At some point, we have to make the decision, and I hope the Liberal government will actually take steps toward ensuring that not only hard-working Canadians pay their fair share, but that the CEOs of companies pay their fair share as well. This loophole benefits the ultra rich, yet successive Liberal and Conservative governments have given up billions of dollars in tax revenue over the past three decades due to this loophole. The Liberals' flip-flop on the stock option loophole shows the influence that powerful insider lobbyists have on the government's policies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789171">The people who have influence on my priorities are the people who I serve in North Island—Powell River, people who work really hard every day, who have had to face the challenges of a changing economy, seeing a resource-based economy, watching as forest companies struggle, and watching as trees are shipped out of the riding. They want more of those good-paying jobs in their communities and they want to ensure they are not paying more than their fair share when other people are not paying what they should be.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789172">The government's systemic acceptance of tax fraudsters and their entities is enabling them to cheat the system. Our system allows every citizen to contribute equitably to public services and social programs. If they do not, every Canadian is cheated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789173">In its 2016 annual report, Oxfam blamed tax havens on income inequality for much of the widening gap between the rich and the poor. Canadians want better health care, community infrastructure, good jobs, and for us to tackle climate change. Instead, the Liberals are maintaining tax loopholes that benefit Canada's wealthiest, while leaving most Canadians behind.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789174">Seniors are making choices among heat, medication, and housing. Families cannot afford day care or even the toonie it takes to send their kids on school trips.

              <ParaText id="4789190">Madam Speaker, before I begin, I wish to inform you that I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="214354" Type="2">Rivière-des-Mille-Îles</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789191">Let me begin by saying that when we have an economy that works for the middle class, we have a country that works for everyone. Since coming into office, our government has worked to bring confidence and optimism back to Canada's middle class and to help those working to join it. We remain committed to doing even more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789192">One of our government's first actions after coming into government was to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1%, so we could lower taxes on the middle class. We reduced the 22% federal income tax rate to 20.5% for 2016 and subsequent taxation years. This tax cut is already benefiting nearly nine million Canadians. Single individuals who benefit will see an average tax reduction of $330 every year and couples will benefit by seeing an average tax reduction of $540 every year. This means more money in the pockets of the middle class. To help pay for the middle-class tax cuts, the government raised taxes on the wealthiest Canadians by introducing a new top income tax rate of 33% for individuals with a taxable income of more than $200,000 per year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789193"> Our government then proceeded with one of the most significant social policy innovations in a generation; that is, bringing in the new Canada child benefit. The CCB is giving nine out of 10 families and their children more money every month to spend on everything from school supplies to sporting equipment. Families who benefit saw an average increase in child benefits of almost $2,300 in the 2016-17 fiscal year. The CCB has tremendously helped families in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="214009" Type="2">Brampton North</Affiliation>. Raising a family in Canada can be challenging and the CCB has helped ease the financial burden for Brampton North families who need it most.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789194">Our government is also taking important steps to make sure that Canadians today have a more secure and dignified retirement in the future. Just last week, we marked the final step in implementing the enhancement to the Canada pension plan.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789195">Taken together, these actions will help strengthen and grow Canada's middle class and, in turn, our economy and our country will be stronger than ever before.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789196">Let me turn to the issue brought forward by this motion today; that is, ensuring a fair tax system for Canada. We believe every Canadian must pay their fair share of taxes, period. Underground economic activity, tax evasion, and aggressive tax planning stand in the way of tax fairness. Too often, it is hard-working, middle-class Canadians, like those in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="214009" Type="2">Brampton North</Affiliation>, who pick up the tab for the selfish motives of certain individual businesses that look to gain an unfair advantage. This is totally unacceptable. That is why our government has taken, and continues to take, action to crack down on tax evasion and to combat aggressive tax avoidance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789197">Part of the government's strategy to fight these problems includes providing the Canada Revenue Agency with sufficient resources to administer and enforce tax laws. For example, budget 2016 committed $444.4 million to enhance the CRA's efforts to crack down on tax evasion and to combat tax avoidance by taking a number of actions. These include hiring additional auditors and specialists, developing robust business intelligence infrastructure, increasing verification activities, and improving the quality of investigative work that targets criminal tax evaders.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789198">Budget 2016 also invested $351.6 million to help the CRA improve its ability to collect outstanding tax debt, which will help collect approximately another $7.4 billion in tax debt owed to the Government of Canada.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4789199">Furthermore, Canada's tax system requires ongoing adjustments to ensure it is functioning as intended and contributing to the objective of the economy that works for everyone. That is why internationally Canada is actively engaged in coordinated multilateral efforts to address base erosion and profit shifting, also known as BEPS, which refers to international tax planning arrangements undertaken by multinational enterprises to inappropriately minimize their taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789200">Here at home, we are working to prevent the ability of high net worth individuals to use private corporations to inappropriately reduce or defer their taxes. To help address this, budget 2016 introduced measures to prevent business owners from multiplying access to the $500,000 small business deduction using complex partnership and corporate structures; and to close loopholes that allow private corporations to use a life insurance policy to distribute amounts tax-free that would otherwise be taxable.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789201">The measures I mentioned today are by no means exhaustive, but they do give a good indication of the attention that the government is placing on combatting tax evasion and avoidance. Seeking out tax evaders and avoiders is about fairness and Canadians want fairness</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789202"> By taking action to prevent tax evasion and close tax loopholes, we will improve the fairness and integrity of the tax system, and contribute to fiscal sustainability, both at home and abroad. We believe that our plan is the right one to improve the integrity of Canada's tax system.</ParaText>

That means that these people will have more money in their pockets, and that will result in a stronger middle class.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789217"> To help finance this tax reduction for the middle class, the government raised taxes for the wealthiest Canadians by introducing a new personal income tax rate of 33% for individuals with taxable income in excess of $200,000 per year. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789218"> Our government then implemented one of the most important social policy innovations in a generation: the new Canada child benefit, which is helping 10,300 families, with 18,870 children, in my riding. The benefit means that nine out of 10 families with children are receiving more money each month that they can spend on things ranging from school supplies to sports equipment</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789219"> The families this measure helps have seen their child benefits rise by nearly $2,300 per year, for the 2016-2017 benefits. For myself, my constituents in Rivière-des-Mille-Îles receive about $530 per month. Some of the constituents I meet tell me how important the Canada child benefit is for them and for their children’s welfare. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789220"> Our government is also taking important steps to ensure that young Canadians today will be able to enjoy a more secure and dignified retirement in the future. Only last week, we completed the final stage in the implementation of improvements to the Canada pension plan. This set of measures will help to strengthen the middle class and move middle-class Canadians forward.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789221"> I would now like to address the issue raised by today's motion, which is ensuring the fairness of Canada's tax system. The underground economy, tax evasion, and aggressive tax planning stand in the way of tax fairness, and too often it is hard-working middle-class Canadians who foot the bill for the selfishness of individuals and businesses looking to gain an unfair advantage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789222"> Let us be clear: that is totally unacceptable. That is why our government continues to take action to tackle tax evasion and combat aggressive tax avoidance. As part of its strategy to counter these practices, the government provides the Canada Revenue Agency with sufficient resources to implement and enforce tax laws.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789223">For example, the 2016 budget included a commitment of $444.4 million to allow the Canada Revenue Agency to do even more to crack down on tax evasion and combat tax avoidance using various measures. These measures include hiring additional auditors and specialists, developing solid business intelligence infrastructure, intensifying audit activities, and improving the quality of investigative activities that target cases of criminal tax evasion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789224"> The 2016 budget also allocated $351 million over five years to the Canada Revenue Agency to help increase its ability to recover outstanding tax debts, which will facilitate the collection of $7.4 billion in taxes payable to the government and to Canadians.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4789225"> Furthermore, Canada's tax system requires constant adjustments in order to function as intended and help us achieve an economy that serves all of the people. That is why Canada is actively involved in coordinated multilateral activities at the international level to combat base erosion and profit shifting, namely international tax planning mechanisms used by multinationals to inappropriately reduce their taxes to a minimum.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789226"> In Canada, we are working to block the ability of wealthy individuals to use private companies to inappropriately reduce or defer their taxes. To address this concern, the 2016 budget contained measures to prevent business owners from taking advantage of the $500,000 small business deduction more than once by using complex corporate and partnership structures, and to eliminate loopholes that allow private companies to use a life insurance policy to distribute amounts tax-free which would otherwise be taxable. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789227"> The measures that I have mentioned today are by no means exhaustive. Nevertheless, they do provide a good indication of the attention the government is giving to combatting tax evasion and avoidance. Measures targeting people who engage in tax evasion are about fairness. By working to prevent tax evasion and eliminate tax loopholes, we will improve the integrity of the tax system and contribute to the sustainability of public finances at home and abroad.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789228"> I am firmly convinced that our plan is the one needed to enhance the integrity of the Canadian tax system. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789240">Madam Speaker, with all of these tax measures, it has been estimated that Canadians are losing out to the tune of $100 billion in monies that should be invested in supporting Canadians. For example, the national pharmacare program is estimated to cost about $6 billion annually. The national child care program, on the eve of International Women's Day, would be $5 billion annually. To support indigenous children who do not have access to equal education opportunities would only cost $155 million. I would like to ask the member, would it not be better to close the tax loopholes, shut down the tax havens, change the tax credits that the Liberals and Conservatives successively over many years continue to give away to the wealthiest, the ultra-wealthy, and the big corporations with their tax measures, and take that money and invest it in Canadians at home where it is needed?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789247">I am pleased to rise today to talk to an issue finally that really matters to people in my riding, and if the motion were to pass, would actually do something for them. We spend a lot of time talking about various issues which the different parties bring forward, but I am not always convinced that the subject is really top of mind for my constituents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789248">The idea that people who in half a day make what an average Canadian worker makes in an entire year send that money to Barbados and do not pay tax on it, or who decide around the corporate board table to get paid in stock options instead of a salary and not pay the same tax on that money, is outrageous.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789249">There is an important principle at stake here. It is one which separates the NDP from the other two traditional parties in the House which have spent a long time working together to find ways to help people who are already rich and powerful shelter their money and not pay their fair share of taxes. That is something on which Canadians want to see us take action. People where I am from want to see us take action on this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789250"> People go out to work every day and they pay their fair share of taxes. They are also looking at their families and noticing that as their parents and grandparents age, they need help with health services. The cost of drugs is high. Yet, we have heard successive Liberal and Conservative governments, no matter what they promise in their platforms, plead poverty. They claim not to have money for a national pharmacare program. They claim it is too expensive and ask where they would get the money. It is pretty hard to believe government, whether it be Conservative or Liberal, that we do not have the money, when we see the amount of money that is bleeding out of the Canadian economy every year because people who make obscene amounts of money do not want to pay their fair share of taxes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789251">It is hard to believe that we do not really have the money. The problem is that the Liberals and Conservatives would have to stand up to their friends in order to get it. Canadians deserve a government that is willing to stand up to corporate Canada and say, “You are here making money in Canada. You have to pay your fair share.” Companies are making money in Canada and they are making that money because Canadians go to work every day and produce value for those companies. Government should stand up and tell them to pay their fair share so that when a mother gets sick and needs a certain prescription drug regimen, she can afford it. When Canadians are going out to work to produce that value for those companies, the companies should chip in their fair share so that their workers can have proper child care so that their kids have a safe place to be during the day. The workers are producing value for the people and companies that cannot be bothered to pay their fair share in taxes but instead think that sending their money to Barbados is an acceptable way to conduct themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789252">This issue is one of the main drivers for my participating in politics. I look at the old line parties, be they Liberal or Conservative, and the way they fold when powerful, rich folks come to Ottawa to tell them what to do, and I think it is disgusting. Canadians deserve better.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789253">As an example, we thought that maybe the Liberal Party was about to kick its old habit of kowtowing to the rich and powerful in Canada in the last election when the Liberals agreed to close the stock hold loophole for CEOs. It is in black and white in the Liberals' platform. That was a promise. Nothing changed from before the election to after the election, except that the Liberals were elected. They knew they had four years in government and they did not have to keep their promises to Canadians. That was their attitude. The only thing that changed was that they were elected. Then the Bay Street lobbyists came to Ottawa, and the evidence is in the lobbying registry, and spoke to their buddy the minister of high finance and said, “Mr. Minister, please, you can't do this. It is going to cost me so much money I am going to have to get the “B” class yacht instead of the “A” class yacht.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789254">Can the Liberals go to Canadian families and tell them there is not going to be a national pharmacare plan? Can they go to Canadian workers, the ones who are working for me, and tell them they cannot get reliable access to safe child care because people do not want to be embarrassed when they go down south for a month and their yacht is not the nicest on the dock? Imagine the nerve and the gall of what is being said in those private conversations and what is being asked of ordinary Canadians who not only need help but are working and paying their fair share for a system in this country that they want to deliver on the things they need, be it child care, be it a drug plan, be it investments in home care. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4789255">We have a government that is unwilling to go after tax cheats. It is giving them amnesty. Then the government is saying it does not have enough money for home care so the provinces are going to have to accept the Harper escalator on health care. If the provinces want just a little home care money that the government eked out for Canadians, which was an election promise that was to be flowed immediately, the government managed to find a little of that money but it is not going to give it to the provinces unless they sign on to the Harper escalator.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789256">That is where politics has gone in this country under the Liberal government. It is using promises it made and money that should have been there, that the government promised would be there, to hold provinces hostage unless they accept less health care funding overall, funding which would have a direct benefit to Canadian working families. In the meantime, the government is instructing the CRA to give amnesty to the people who are taking money out of the Canadian economy and sending it elsewhere. It is reprehensible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789257">We could talk about other current issues, for instance, worries about whether we have enough resources to accommodate refugees, whether we are doing our fair share when it comes to first nations and giving them what they are owed in order to get those communities back on their feet. Again, governments plead poverty, be it a Liberal government or a Conservative government. It ends up the same.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789258">The fact of the matter is we produce a lot of wealth in Canada. If the people who are making the most, those at the top, would pay their fair share, we could afford to do these things.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789259"> There is a revenue problem in Canada. It is not because the revenue does not exist. It is not because the wealth is not being produced. It is not because we cannot pay for these things. It is because the government will not pay for it, because it means challenging its buddies. That is not fair to ordinary Canadians who are paying their fair share, who are going to work every day, and who thought they were voting for a government that was willing to do that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789260">The government talks about its tax cut for the middle class. The Liberals cannot define the middle class, so it is interesting to hear them use the term all the time. In fact, they put in writing that they could not define the middle class. At least we can say that the middle class according to the Liberals does not include anyone who makes under $45,000 a year.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789261">Then the Liberals promised they would make up for that tax cut at least by instituting a new tax on those making the most, and that that was going to be revenue neutral. Well, they did bring in that tax increase, but they did not do it on the basis of paying for the tax cut for the middle class. The people who got the most benefit out of that tax cut already make six figures. There we have it again.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789262">The Liberals were going to do the Robin Hood thing. They were going to tax the rich, bring in a whole new tax bracket. They were going to pay for this tax cut that was supposed to be for the middle class but actually ended up being for people making six figures, and they could not even get that right. At the end of the day, they actually reduced government revenue to give a tax cut, the maximum benefit of which went to people making six figures, and in the meantime granted amnesty to the people we know are Canada's worst tax cheats.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789263">How does that square with the notion that the Liberals are going to courageously go after Canada's wealthy to give a fair shake to ordinary Canadian workers? For those in the House who are wondering and those at home who are wondering, it does not square. That is why I am glad to be sitting in a caucus of 44 people who are willing to say so and put it on the record, because if it was up to the other two parties, no one would be saying that much.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789264">It is important to speak truth to power. It is something the Liberals promised to do, but when the Bay Street lobbyists came and the decision point came and they actually had to do the deed, they actually had to say, “Sorry, rich guys whom I really want to be friends with because you are just so cool, and maybe I will get to ride on your helicopter to a private island, but we are going to have to do something that costs you money.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789265">When it came down to it, the Liberals could not do it. They just could not do it. The Liberals just want to fit in so badly with the rich and powerful, when they should be trying to fit in with ordinary working Canadians who go to work every day and pay their taxes, and who want to be part of a country that assesses a fair rate on everyone and does not say, “Because you make a lot of money, you are off the hook.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789266">What is the message being sent to Canadians here? The message is that if they get caught not paying quite enough tax but make a regular income, the Liberals will come after them. The problem is they did not cheat enough. If they had just cheated more, then they would be in the category of people the Liberals do not really want to go after.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789267">The message being sent to Canadians is not to cheat a little bit, but to cheat a lot. They can only do that if they make enough money to cheat that much, and if they do, the Liberals will want to be their friends. Otherwise they are just ordinary Canadians, and the Liberals cannot give them the time of day after getting elected.</ParaText>

The Liberals voted against that, and I do not understand why. It was a disappointment that they were not actually willing to give a tax break to every working Canadian, so we felt we could not support their proposals.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789285">Madam Speaker, we have been hearing about austerity and cuts for years. We are familiar with the refrain of successive governments in Ottawa, Quebec, and elsewhere in the world, who have been feeding us the same message for at least 30 years, the same reductive solution of having to tighten our belts and live within our means.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789286">It is as though the public institutions that we have legitimately established were an extravagance, as though the state structure built in Quebec and Canada to better educate ourselves, to take better care of ourselves, and to develop our economy were but a fantasy.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789287">The entire time that a thousand and one cuts were being made, the system was haemorrhaging billions of dollars. Untold billions of dollars are leaving our tax system as a result of tax evasion and tax avoidance orchestrated by accounting firms big and small on behalf of their clients, the richest individuals and businesses in Canada. They are the wealthiest 1%. These people send the profits they make in Canada to tax havens and refuse to contribute to society like everyone else does.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789288">This has been going on for years. Not enough has been done and ordinary people have been asked to pay more for too long. It is like a plumber coming to the house and telling us that instead of repairing the huge leak that is spewing water in the street, we will have to learn to live with lower water pressure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789289">The use of tax havens in the Caribbean or even the British Isles, for example, where billions are tucked away, has reached historic levels. Never before have we seen such an abuse of the tax system, and it is an international problem. In 2015, the last year the Conservatives were in power, $40 billion were transferred from Canadian bank accounts to about ten tax havens. Since 1990, $270 billion have disappeared.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789290">Every year, billions of dollars are stashed away in tax havens. As if that were not bad enough, the government also gives the wealthy all kinds of little tax goodies to help them save. That costs the treasury $100 billion a year. The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives is very diligent about reminding us of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789291">It is easier to tell Quebeckers and Canadians that they are not living within their means than it is to confront the wealthiest 1% of CEOs about the things they do that are hurting everyone. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789292">This is happening right before our very eyes. We are talking about multinational corporations whose products we buy every day. People who buy their coffee at Starbucks probably know that the company was at the centre of a scandal in the United Kingdom because it went for years without paying taxes by using a strategy that enabled it to remove its profits from the country to give the impression that it was not making enough money in its stores there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789293">Canadian businesses and banks use the same strategy. In 2009, TD Bank paid just 7.6% in taxes when everyone else was paying 32%. BCE reported profits of $30 billion from 2004 to 2014 but paid a mere 5% in taxes. Gildan, a Montreal-based textiles manufacturer that makes t-shirts all over the world and has benefited substantially from a number of government subsidies, makes hundreds of millions in profits every year, but paid no taxes in 2009, 2010, 2011, or 2012 thanks to an address in the Caribbean.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789294">That is all it takes to keep billions of dollars out of the Canadian tax system, and more often than not, it is completely legal and even condoned by our governments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789295">How is it that these companies seem to think that they do not have any responsibility to society and they do not have to contribute? How is it that our governments agreed to turn a blind eye to this sort of tax avoidance, when they have been saying for years that they need to make cuts to hospitals, schools, rail regulations, and our presence on the international stage, when they are still saying that there is not even enough money to give seniors in long-term care facilities baths?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789300">However, our fat cats are not the only ones exploiting the flaws in our system; we now turn a blind eye to web giants who are stuffing themselves in the online shopping buffet.

              <ParaText id="4789301">While a business here has to pay taxes on its business transactions on the Internet, a company that does business online in Canada doesn't have the same obligation, a situation that is making less and less sense as e-commerce grows.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789302">That is likely why the OECD is now proposing standards for the taxation of online goods and services. Basically, the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> believes that, if a corporation has no head office or physical presence in Canada, it is not engaged in commercial activity here. He may be right when it comes to cobblers and pizzerias, but certainly not for something like Facebook, which has millions of users in Canada, and certainly not for Amazon or Apple, which compete directly with businesses here. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789303">Any other Canadian business that dares compete with online companies is immediately at a disadvantage, simply because it will be taxed. This is especially difficult in the media industry, which is going through a very tough time. The editor of the <I>Winnipeg Free Press</I> pointed out that Canadian readers of the online edition are taxed on their subscription, but they are not taxed when they subscribe to the <I>New York Times</I> online edition. Go figure.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789304">Five or ten years ago, companies' advertising budgets were divided between radio, Quebec and Canadian television, and national and regional media, both print and digital. Today, however, 80% of those budgets go directly out of the country, through ad placements on Facebook and Google. This amounts to hundreds of billions of dollars a year that are leaving the country without being taxed. Our media are being bled dry. Even worse, in some cases, these foreign online ad placements are even tax deductible. We know very well that, in the case of the biggest web-based multinationals, this money literally disappears.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789305">In the United Kingdom, instead of registering its British advertising revenue and being taxed in the U.K., Facebook recently decided to move everything to Ireland and the Cayman Islands in order to avoid paying token amounts in taxes. When word got out, people reacted negatively and Facebook did some back-pedalling, after a few years of a little tax holiday, because the public got upset, but more importantly, because political officials took responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789306">Yes, I am looking at the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789307">Since 2015, the British government has been a pioneer in charging an extra 25% levy on foreign corporations that try to avoid paying taxes. That was a tough pill to swallow for the likes of Facebook and Amazon, who finally started paying their taxes after having processed all their transactions through Luxembourg for years. The moral of the story is: where there is political will, tax avoidance can be beat, including when it comes to companies that do business online.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789308">The statement by British finance minister, George Osborne, could not have been clearer: he said that their corporate tax rate was among the lowest in the world, but England expects those taxes to be paid.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789309">Here in Ottawa, we can only dream of our <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> having that much political courage. In the meantime, this wide-scale tax avoidance is doing immeasurable harm to businesses in Quebec and Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789310">Last weekend's edition of <I>La Presse</I> called this the Swiss cheese effect because it could create holes in Quebec's economy. The same article quoted Peter Simons, the president of La Maison Simons, a very successful and well-known Quebec retailer that just opened a new store in the nearby Rideau Centre. Mr. Simons talked about how big of a problem this is for electronic commerce. He pays his taxes and his customs fees, and he pays for his products and buildings, which are taxed. However, his competitors do not do any of that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789311">He said it very clearly: taxes are his biggest expense. He added that it is not right for a company that conducts 90% of its operations in North America to send 99% of the profits to Luxembourg. He also added that the things that cost the most in a society are the people, education, roads, and health, and that, as a society, we need to fund our values. He went on to say that he worries that the government will fall back into a pattern of making cuts without identifying root causes. He said that he does not have all the answers but that he believes that everyone should have to pay their fair share and participate in society. Companies cannot come to Quebec and Canada and expect to do business without taking any responsibility.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789312">That is from one of our own business people. He is worried that governments are not listening to him and not getting his message. Mr. Simons added that he is not sure the government sees any urgency here and that the legislative framework must be redefined.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789313">The weekend edition of <I>La Presse </I> said the same thing: Our elected representatives have to do a better job of helping merchants rise to those challenges and stopping multinationals from getting around the rules. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789314">I wish I could say that I believe Canada will change the rules to put a stop to tax havens, but the truth is that Conservative and Liberal party cronies are the ones who created those tax havens in the first place. Here are just a few of them: Graham Towers, a former governor of the Bank of Canada, was an advisor to the Government of Jamaica when that country became a tax haven. Jim MacDonald, once a high-ranking Conservative Party lawyer, drafted the Cayman Islands' tax policies when that country became a tax haven. Donald Fleming, a former Canadian minister, put together the Bahamas' tax measures when that country became a tax haven in the 1960s.</ParaText>

                <I>Qujannamiik uqaqti</I>. Madam Speaker, I stand today to honour my father Batiste, and all Inuit of his generation. They were born and raised on the land, and survived only because of what they learned from their forebears. This long line of inherited insight enabled intelligence and skill development among Inuit, and served as a true form of evidence-based knowledge. One of my dad's favourite sayings is, “There is no such thing as can't.” Living by these words, his intelligence and persistence allowed him to provide solutions to the most difficult problems.</ParaText>

This is the kind of mentality that must persist in our future generations.</ParaText>

On February 19, mezuzahs were ripped off door frames, and anti-Semitic messages were found in Toronto. On February 22, a swastika and the words “gas the Jews” were found spray-painted in Hamilton. On February 27, swastikas were found on classroom walls at York University. On the February 28, the Calgary Jewish Community Centre received a bomb threat.

However, starting in the late 1980s, subsequent governments reduced the federal role in building affordable housing. The consequences of this lack of investment are now painfully evident in the city of Victoria, where we now have the lowest vacancy rate in Canada and some of the highest rents and housing prices.

              <ParaText id="4789568">The Liberal Party has taken the issue of tax fairness as one of those foundational pillars in terms of being an issue that we believe is good for Canada's middle class. When we think of tax fairness, we can talk about the middle-class tax break in the last budget. We can talk about the tax increase on Canada's wealthiest. We can talk about some of the other benefits, like the Canada child benefit, which lifts literally thousands of children out of poverty, or the seniors GIS 10% increase, which will, again, lift tens of thousands of seniors out of poverty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789569">We have seen a holistic approach in dealing with the issue of tax fairness. That is something the government has heard loud and clear from Canadians, and we are acting on it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789570">One aspect of the budget was to allocate $444 million towards fighting tax evasion. I wonder if the member could provide some comment on whether he believes that this specific measure will be able to reap the rewards in terms of getting those who are trying to avoid paying taxes to pay their fair share, something we, as the government, want to see happen.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789572">Investing $444 million to form a squad to go after those tax shelters and people who profit from them, who are clearly abusing the system, is great. Investing the money needed is great, but that said, we need to see some results. For instance, during question period today, it did not exactly reassure us to hear the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> reply with the same old broken record.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789573">The truth is, we would like to see the government show some international leadership on coordination efforts, or regarding companies that take advantage of tax shelters by hiding their profits in places that are clearly in on it. We want to see a government that wants to resolve the problem and take the lead on this. For months I have been asking the <Affiliation DbId="214327" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Heritage</Affiliation> whether she got the message to the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and whether the government is finally going to collect GST and provincial taxes on international services that are provided over the Internet.

              <ParaText id="4789574">Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for his great speech breaking down the impact of tax havens and legal tax loopholes here in our country, which have cost Canadians, as he stated, more than $200 billion over the last couple of decades. When we put that together, that is as much as the whole national infrastructure deficit in our whole country. That means that every street and every pipe could be fixed right now had we closed those loopholes created by consecutive Liberal and Conservative governments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789575">We can break that down and look at tax havens alone. These are legal tax havens. I am not talking about those who are breaking the law. I appreciate the government taking action to go after tax cheats, but I am talking about legal loopholes that need to be closed, which are costing us at least $7 billion a year. When we break that down by 338 ridings across Canada, that is more than $200 million a year per riding.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789580">It is a pleasure for me to rise today to speak to the House on behalf of my riding of Davenport on this opposition day motion on tax avoidance. Tax avoidance was one of the top issues that Davenport residents had written to me about a year ago. It was an issue that actually caused quite a bit of consternation in my riding after the stories of the Panama papers came out. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789581">For those who might not remember the Panama papers, it was a huge leak of documents that basically lifted the lid on how many rich and powerful people in the world have used tax havens to hide their wealth and avoid paying taxes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789582">Davenport residents wrote to me and said they were okay with paying their taxes, but they were upset to hear that there are corporations and rich individuals hiding their wealth and not paying their fair share. I could go into a little more of what they said later, but I will continue by talking about what our government has been doing in tackling this issue, and we have been very aggressive.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789583">The government knows that offshore tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance come at a great cost to society and that all Canadians pay the price. Tax evasion deprives the government of money that could be spent on programs and services for Canadians. Public investments in everything from health and education to research and development are shortchanged every time someone breaks Canada's tax laws. That is why we are taking decisive action to crack down on offshore tax avoidance and tax evasion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789584">Last year alone, the Government of Canada invested $444 million in budget 2016 to empower the Canada Revenue Agency to aggressively pursue those who think they are above the law. I can assure my hon. colleagues in the House that the agency is putting this money to good use. It is focusing resources in areas of the highest risk. It is identifying tax cheats, and it is penalizing those caught contravening the law. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789585">In Canada, CRA auditors conduct more than 120,000 audits every year. Last year alone, that resulted in a fiscal impact assessed at more than $12 billion in taxes, penalties, and interest. Close to $8 billion of that amount, about two-thirds, involves large multinational businesses and high-net-worth individuals, including those with offshore transactions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789586">With the new infusion of funds—the almost half a billion dollars I was talking about—the CRA has increased the number of auditors reviewing offshore tax schemes and the promoters of those schemes. For the 2015-2016 fiscal year, the CRA completed more than 13,000 audits related to aggressive tax planning. That led to an extra $2 billion in the public purse.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789587">As another statistic to add, I know that the CRA will continue to increase the application of penalties to all cases of serious tax cheating. To date, the agency has levied over $218 million in third party penalties against promoters and tax preparers who advise their clients to participate in tax shelter donation schemes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789588">To be clear, many people move money back and forth between countries for entirely legitimate reasons. These are not the people whom the CRA is targeting. The CRA is targeting individuals and companies that promote nefarious tax schemes, or capitalize on them to avoid paying taxes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789589">I want to be equally clear that anyone engaging in these activities can face serious consequences if they are caught. Tax evasion can lead to criminal prosecution, fines, and jail time. It is the CRA's criminal investigations program that investigates suspected cases of tax evasion, fraud, and other serious violations of tax laws. If it finds grounds for action, it recommends cases to the Public Prosecution Service of Canada for criminal prosecution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789590">During the five-year period between April 1, 2011, and March 31, 2016, 42 Canadian taxpayers were convicted for tax evasion, with links to money and assets held offshore. In total, the $34 million in evaded taxes resulted in court fines of $12 million and 734 months of jail time. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="30">(1530)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4789591">Over the same period, total domestic- and offshore-related criminal convictions resulted in 508 convictions, involving approximately $120 million in evaded federal taxes. That led to $40 million in court fines and 2,930 months of jail time for tax cheaters. The CRA is currently conducting audits on more than 820 taxpayer offshore files, and criminally investigating more than 20 cases of tax evasion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789592">I have just mentioned a whole slew of numbers. However, I want to reiterate something that our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said in the House of Commons today during question period, which is that, with respect to tax evasion, this government works on a very strong principle, and that principle is that we hold people to account when they are involved in tax evasion, when they are not paying their fair share of taxes, whether they are individuals or corporations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789593">With respect to recent media reports in relation to the KPMG offshore structures, the CRA continues to take action on a number of fronts, including actively pursuing the matter to its fullest extent in the courts. Going further, by analyzing additional information, the agency has uncovered a number of additional tax schemes set up in the Isle of Man, which many people may not know is an island right in the middle of the Irish Sea. The CRA is analyzing these additional structures to identify any similarities with the KPMG scheme, and will take all necessary compliance actions where appropriate.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789594">However, these are not the only issues on which this government is focused. Whether they are complex corporate structures using offshore jurisdictions of concern or profit-shifting schemes to evade or avoid taxes, the CRA is committed to addressing any and all cases of non-compliance. For example, the CRA has more than 76 taxpayer audits under way related to the Panama papers. It has executed search warrants, and several criminal investigations are ongoing, involving both participants and facilitators. In short, the trap is closing, and those prepared to play fast and loose with the rules will be held to account.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789595">The CRA also intends to review 100,000 files in 2017 involving electronic transfers of funds between Canada and four jurisdictions of concern. The agency is building the business intelligence and the data-mining capability to eventually review all electronic fund transfers in real time. Canadians can be assured that 100% of the transactions that do not make sense or are considered high risk will be reviewed, and appropriate compliance action will take place.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789596">Aggressive, comprehensive audits are only part of the agency's strategy to go after tax evaders. The CRA is also enhancing its efforts on a number of fronts, including expanded systems for information sharing, legal expertise, and targeted compliance activities aimed at high-risk and high-wealth taxpayers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789597">Globally, the Government of Canada works with its international partners through the OECD forum on tax administration. Member countries promote international tax standards, reduce tax barriers, create better opportunities for Canadian businesses, and increase transparency around global issues. They also coordinate strategies to ensure individuals and multinationals are not hiding money and assets offshore.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789598">The government continues to sign tax treaties with other jurisdictions. This provides further information that enables Canada, and our partners, to crack down on tax cheats worldwide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789599">In addition, the offshore compliance advisory committee, reporting to the <Affiliation DbId="214329" Type="4">Minister of National Revenue</Affiliation>, provided its first report to the CRA in December 2016. The report included recommendations for tightening up the voluntary disclosure program. The CRA is carefully reviewing the program to ensure it continues to promote the right taxpayer behaviour.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789600">Collectively, these measures are expected to have a fiscal impact of an additional $2.6 billion for the crown over the next five years. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789601">We are committed to all of this, and we will build on all of these achievements. Last month, the government tabled its response to the report by the House of Commons finance committee entitled “The Canada Revenue Agency, Tax Avoidance and Tax Evasion: Recommended Actions”. That report made it clear that the Government of Canada supports the committee's recommendations and will continue to evolve its approach on offshore non-compliance to generate even better results.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789602">It was a pleasure for me to speak on behalf of the residents of Davenport on this very important issue. I now welcome questions from my colleagues.</ParaText>

First, she may want to correct the record about the government investing this amount of money in CRA this year. It is over a five-year period. It is important for Canadians to understand the investment the Liberals are making into the CRA after the Conservatives cut 3,000 positions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789604">The member said this is a top issue for the folks she represents in Davenport, and then went on to say, over and over again, how much confidence she had in the CRA and its ability to hound and get after these tax cheats. However, we know about the case of KPMG, the scam that she talked about. It was running for more than a decade, by the way, before the great CRA even found out about it. Once it did find out about it, that all of these wealthiest of Canadians were avoiding paying their fair share, the CRA then offered, in secret, a deal to those Canadians to not pay any penalties whatsoever.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789605">Here is the lesson or the message that the Canada Revenue Agency is sending out to wealthy Canadians: if they do cheat, if they use these scams like KPMG set up, CRA will probably never find it, but if it does find it, it will take a decade, so they are good. Even if CRA does find it, all they will have to do is pay some, maybe, of the taxes that are owed but there will not be a penalty.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789606">The Liberals are somehow suggesting that, in paying back what is owed to the Canadian people, the government had the audacity to ask these wealthy, well-heeled Canadians to, oh my gosh, pay the interest on the money that they owed rather than the penalties. What about all those middle-class Canadians Liberals constantly talk about yet do not defend?</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789619">For more than 15 years, the Auditor General has repeatedly said that the use of tax havens is the biggest threat to the tax base. While the government is repeating that it is working very hard to counter this, nothing ever happens. At some point, it will have to stop talking and start acting.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789620">All day members across the way have been saying that the federal government is fighting very hard against tax evasion and tax havens. They may repeat it over and over again, but they are alternative facts. The fact is that Canada is the official spokescountry for tax havens. This is no joke: Canada is indeed the official spokescountry for tax havens, a role it performs openly and without shame.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789621">It does so before the International Monetary Fund, the organization responsible for international financial markets. Canada clearly speaks for tax havens there. Twice a year, when he talks about the IMF world economic outlook, the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> does not speak solely for Canada. No, he speaks on behalf of Canada and Barbados. Barbados is Canada's tax haven and has been since Paul Martin was finance minister and registered his ships in Barbados. Then we have the Bahamas, a tax haven whose insurance laws were written by the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>'s own consulting firm. I cannot name it in the House, because it contains the name of the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789622">At the IMF, Canada defends and is the official spokesperson for Barbados, the Bahamas, Antigua, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and others.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789623">It seems to me that the Liberals are thumbing their noses at Canadians by continuing to say that the government is cracking down on tax havens. Canada is one of the biggest users of tax havens in the world. That is particularly true of Canada's five largest banks. Their use of tax havens to avoid paying taxes costs the federal and provincial governments approximately $6 billion a year. We are talking about $6 billion for just five banks.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789624">In June 2016, the IMF found that the Royal Bank, Scotiabank, and CIBC, these three banks alone, represented 80% of the banking assets in Barbados, Grenada, and the Bahamas. These three Canadian banks hold almost all of the banking assets there.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789625">The government needs to stop saying that Canada is a champion in the fight against tax havens. That is not true. The reality is that Canada is an advocate, protector, and spokesperson for tax havens. In other words, Canada is a cheerleader for tax havens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789626">The KPMG fraud scandal is just the latest example of Canada's inaction. The CRA discovered the Isle of Man fraud over five years ago, but the government has still not filed any criminal charges against KPMG.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789627"> When it comes to talking and saying nothing, the government is always there, but when it comes time for action, it is nowhere to be found.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789628"> I will demonstrate what it means to fight fraud in tax havens. This happened in the United States. In 2003, a senate committee brought to light certain fraud schemes involving tax havens that were sold by KPMG, triggering an investigation by the IRS, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. When KPMG tried to invoke professional privilege to refuse to hand over the list of its fraudster clients, the IRS threatened to obtain a search warrant and charge the firm’s executives with obstruction of justice. Contrary to what is happening here, KPMG submitted and put an end to its obstruction. The U.S. investigation demonstrated that 431 clients of KPMG had concealed $11 billion in revenue from the tax authorities, resulting in lost tax revenues of $2.5 billion between 1996 and 2003.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789629"> Giving the benefit of the doubt to the KPMG clients who said they thought the financing package was legal, since they had acted on the recommendation of their accountant, the IRS offered them a conditional amnesty. This was not at all the same amnesty as we have here. They were required to repay their debts within 90 days, including interest and a 50% penalty, or else go to prison. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789630"> All the clients agreed, and the IRS recovered $3.7 billion on the $2.5 billion owing, including the 50% penalty plus interest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789631"> In the United States, an amnesty means that people have to repay one and a half times their debt. The Americans were not content with hunting down the fraudsters. They went after the source of the problem, the fraud barons, KPMG itself. Here we give them billions of dollars in contracts; there, they are prosecuted. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="50">(1550)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4789632"> On June 13, 2005, two years after the fraud was discovered, the <?bk ?>U.S.<?ek ?> government laid criminal charges against KPMG. Nine of its executives faced charges of fraud and criminal conspiracy. The firm itself was accused of being a criminal organization, something that could have resulted in its dissolution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789633"> Two weeks later, on June 27, 2005, the Internal Revenue Service, the IRS, announced that it had come to an out-of-court settlement with KPMG. In return for dropping the criminal charges which could have led to the company’s dissolution, KPMG agreed to dismantle three of its departments, to stop selling tax planning services, to pay the government $466 million, nearly half a billion, in damages, and to give an IRS agent unlimited access to all of its files for three years.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789634"> The above notwithstanding, the criminal charges were maintained against the nine executives. Two were found innocent, six had to pay fines totalling $25 million, and one was imprisoned. It was the defrauder-in-chief who ended up in prison. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789635">Here in Canada, the government gives fraudsters contracts worth $92 million. Good for them! The government thanks fraudsters and shower them with gifts. They are all buddy-buddy. The fact is that the government does everything it can to facilitate the use of tax havens. That is the problem we have here. When it comes to helping its banker buddies, the government is happy to play an active role.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789636">The Income Tax Act prohibits the use of tax havens. Parliamentarians never voted for that. A close look at the tax treaties shows that the use of tax havens is not allowed. For example, article 30 of the treaty with Barbados explicitly excludes all businesses with special tax benefits in Barbados. According to the treaty, profits sent to Barbados have to be taxed in Canada. The treaty is clear, and its implementation act is rock-solid. The act states that provisions in this treaty take precedence over incompatible provisions in any other act or regulation. In other words, under the act to implement the Canada-Barbados treaty, the government is obligated to tax repatriated profits. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789637"> As for the agreements that Canada has concluded with the other 22 tax havens, they are nothing but information sharing agreements. They too do not give anyone the right not to pay income tax in Canada. The tax treaties and the Income Tax Act are not the problem; the problem is the regulations which contradict the treaties and were adopted without a vote.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789638"> The government has passed regulations that facilitate tax avoidance. When I said that Canada was the protector of tax havens, I was not exaggerating. Not only does it speak on their behalf at the IMF, it secretly amends the tax regulations that authorize their use.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789639"> On this subject, I would like to point out an inaccuracy in the motion being debated today. The motion asks us to renegotiate these tax treaties when it should instead seek to abolish the tax regulations that permit the use of tax havens. It is not the treaties or the laws that are bad. The problem is the regulations that the government has adopted on the quiet. It is the regulations and the government that are bad, not the treaties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789640"> I would therefore like to collaborate with the NDP on this subject so as to continue the fight against tax havens. At the end of my speech I will be proposing an amendment to the motion that will address this inaccuracy. I will return to this point in a moment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789641"> I repeat: tax havens are the greatest injustice of our time. Now when the tabling of the budget is drawing near, now when everyone has a gun to their head and public services are jammed up, it is absolutely scandalous for the government to be giving billions of dollars in gifts to the wealthy. Tax havens must be eliminated.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789642"> I propose to amend the motion by modifying a few words in paragraph (<I>b</I>)(ii). It is a matter of replacing the words “renegotiating tax treaties that let” with the words “abolishing tax regulations that let”.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789655">There are many things that we would like to ask the federal government to do for Quebec and the provinces. In matters of tax evasion and tax havens, the exchange of information happens between countries. Therefore, it is the Canada Revenue Agency that has the authority to ask other countries for information in order to conduct investigations. Depending on the wording of tax treaties, the federal government can also delegate this authority to provincial or national entities, such as Revenu Québec. This would allow the Government of Quebec to conduct its own investigations and to negotiate directly with other countries. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789656">There seems to be unanimity in the Quebec National Assembly on tax evasion. This would allow it to move forward. I would remind members that when a tax scheme is discovered in Quebec, there is an automatic 30% penalty. In the United States, a penalty of 50% was levied in the case of KPMG. The Quebec government has a 30% penalty, but the federal government has no penalty.

              <ParaText id="4789660">Madam Speaker, if there is one topic on everyone's lips these days, it is the one we are addressing today. Since time is running out and in order to allow as many people as possible to reflect the views of the citizens who live in each of the ridings, views that all point in the same direction, I am announcing that I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="214113" Type="2">Laurier—Sainte-Marie</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789661">Let me say from the outset that I am far from being a tax expert. I am not an expert in the matter, but one thing I am sure of is that I listen to the citizens in my riding and share their frustration on the issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789662">I would like to be able to say that politicians are leaders in tax fairness and that they promote measures that improve the lives of all Canadians. However, the truth is that, once again, we are tagging along behind the simmering anger of our citizens.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789663">The difference between the NDP and successive governments in Ottawa is that we hear the grumbling and we are doing everything we can to propose tangible measures to stem this rising tide.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789664"> For example, in the last election campaign, we were roundly criticized by some people for our proposal to balance the budget. Maybe we did not sell our own platform well enough. What is clear is that there were proposals in the revenue column that no other party in the House dared to make, that directly influenced the government’s capacity to seek out new revenue sources. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789665"> We need only think of the tax rate on large corporations that the Conservatives cut from 22% to 15%, as part of a job creation strategy, with very few results when it came to job creation. I will always remember that request, or rather that plea, by a former minister of finance, Mr. Flaherty, for whom I have great respect, even though we had different political allegiances. He pleaded with the big businesses to which we had given tax cuts to reinject the money into the economy. That did not happen, and we know the rest.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789666"> At present, with wealth disparities continuing to grow, it is high time that we did something, that we stop talking and start acting. Instead of hiding behind the excuse that the problem is international in scope and we cannot do anything on our own, it is time for Canada to act like a leader and initiate the movement. Canada could be in the lead, as I was saying, instead of just saying “Canada is back”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789667"> I am going to give a few statistics, just to provide a clear and precise picture in two or three figures, for everyone listening to us. We are talking about Canada, with Canadian numbers. The highest paid CEOs in Canada are paid 193 times the average Canadian wage. I am not talking about the median wage, even; I am talking about the average wage. Two billionaires own about one third of all personal wealth in Canada: $33.1 billion. The richest CEOs earn in a half day what the average worker earns in a year. We can see how urgent is is for us to promote greater equity, to hear and understand the discontent expressed to us from everyone in Quebec and Canada when they tell us enough is enough.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789668"> I am therefore pleased to rise today to speak on behalf of the taxpayers of Trois-Rivières who work hard to make ends meet and who are faced with this scourge of tax evasion and tax avoidance, which must be condemned, certainly, but which must also be combated with effective proposals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789669"> To that end, the NDP is proposing very concrete measures. For the people who are following our debates, these are the main points of our motion. The NDP is calling on the Liberal government to identify the tax giveaways that benefit the wealthy and keep its promise, among other things, to cap the stock option deduction loophole. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4789670">For instance, what is the real issue with stock options, since most Quebeckers or Canadians cannot really afford to buy them?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789671">A CEO can buy shares in the company he himself leads and sell them when he sees fit. Obviously, the right time for him will be when he will be guaranteed the most money. The resulting profit will be a capital gain taxed at half the rate of regular working income. The federal government is therefore encouraging large corporations to keep up this practice, since the CEOs who are benefiting from it pay 50% less tax on the profit from selling their shares.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789672">As a result of this tax loophole, every year, the federal government and the provinces are losing $1 billion in revenue that could have been put toward a better employment insurance system, compensation for all the pyrrhotite victims in Trois-Rivières and Mauricie while we are at it, and upgrading our infrastructure, particularly in terms of Internet access since we know that many remote regions still do not have broadband service. In short, with $1 billion, just imagine what a finance minister could dream of. However, it seems that the minister has a stronger allegiance to the wealthiest than to the middle class he keeps talking about.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789673">To make our tax system fairer, the NDP proposes three concrete measures to address tax evasion: tightening rules for shell companies, renegotiating tax treaties that let companies repatriate profits to Canada tax-free, and ending penalty-free amnesty deals for individuals suspected and potentially charged or convicted of tax evasion, should there ever be a prosecution someday.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789674">I would like to briefly comment on the relevance of our motion. Many people are finalizing their income tax returns and doing their duty as citizens. However, for those for whom the T4 is everything, or in other words, those who file the simplest income tax return with just one source of revenue, there are no loopholes available. That is the case for most Canadians, but late filers beware because there will inevitably be penalties. That means that average Canadians, and I am not talking about those with an average salary, but most Canadians who file their income tax return using only a single T4, will have to pay penalties at even the slightest sign of an error. I am not talking about fraud but about mistakes. That is because it is easy for the government or the CRA to catch these errors and do something about them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789675">It is true that it may be more difficult to determine whether large corporations are evading taxes, but the government needs to put more time, energy, and money into doing so. When the Conservatives took office, it was the opposite. They cut a lot of positions at the Canada Revenue Agency, which made it practically impossible to conduct these kinds of major investigations.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789676"> Every time we see a pothole or wait forever for health care, we have to remember that the money meant to improve our roads and our public services is hidden on the Isle of Man or somewhere else.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789677"> Unfortunately, because I have only a minute left, I will jump ahead to the conclusion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789678">Despite not having had the time to say everything I wanted to say, I hope that the main takeaway is how emotionally-charged the issue is for me because of what I hear, day after day, when I travel in my riding and people say to me, “Enough is enough, thank you to the NDP for standing up in the House and fighting to put an end to tax evasion and tax avoidance.”</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4789697">Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to rise in the House today to speak to this motion. In my opinion, tax avoidance and tax evasion rank right up there with world peace and the need to save the planet. This is an extremely important issue.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789698">In the riding of Laurier—Sainte-Marie, there are community organizations that are struggling to make ends meet and cannot hire the staff they need. I meet with young people who would like the government to invest in their future and in the green economy. Some immigrants need more services, and that includes French tests that cost the same as English tests.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789699">Some organizations that help homeless women have to turn people away because they do not have enough room. There are families with children who have to choose between paying rent and paying for groceries because the government is not investing enough in affordable housing and social housing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789700">All across the country, people are waiting for reasonably priced day care spaces, workers want the government to invest in job retraining, children are living in poverty, and indigenous people want the government to keep its promises.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789701">Far too often, there are not enough resources to accomplish all these basic things. However, the resources are there. In the meantime, we are losing hundreds of billions of dollars to tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789702">There is no reason this lost money should not be recovered. Some tangible measures can be taken immediately. One clear and straightforward example would be to get rid of the stock options tax loophole for CEOs. When CEOs are paid with stock options, their salary is considered a capital gain and is taxed at half the regular rate. Through this option, roughly 8,000 Canadians have deducted on average $400,000 from their taxable income.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789703">Someone who earns $40,000 does not have that option. They have to pay the regular tax rate that applies to that salary. However, CEOs are entitled to reduce a big part of their income by 50%. It is interesting because during the election campaign, the Liberals promised to cap it at $100,000. I think that is rather generous. However, once elected, they broke their promise. What a surprise.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789704">There are other very simple things that can be done. We could amend the tax rules for businesses that are fond of using shell companies, which have no economic purpose. They only serve to protect the wealth of the ultra-rich. Therefore, we could ask businesses to provide proof of the economic reasons justifying the existence of foreign subsidiaries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789705">We could also review tax agreements that allow businesses to report their profits in tax havens and to return them to Canada tax free. In my opinion, this is vitally important. There are 92 such treaties with countries such as Barbados, Jamaica, and the Republic of Malta, among others, which allow people to commit tax evasion simply by sending billions of dollars to tax havens without paying taxes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789706">For example, between 1988 and 2001, direct Canadian investment in Barbados rose from $628 million to $23.3 billion, a 3,600% increase.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789707">It is also crucial that we put an end to penalty-free tax amnesty deals for individuals suspected of tax evasion.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4789708">Case in point, recently a deal was made with KPMG clients shielding them from civil or criminal prosecution as well as fines and penalties.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789709">If I file my taxes late, I have to pay a fine. Same goes for the guy next door and all other ordinary Canadians, but people who get caught evading taxes do not have to pay a fine. Worse still, a young teenager who shoplifts has to pay the price, but the super-rich do not have to pay anything back. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789710">We also need a higher threshold for foreign subsidiaries' interest payments. That is another tax avoidance strategy. I do not have much time, so I will not go into detail, but meaningful action can be taken now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789711">The truth is, we do not really know how much money is involved because tax evasion and tax avoidance, by definition, hide money. Still, if we had that money, we could fund our social programs.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789712">In the longer term, we need to work at the international level. I would like to see Canada take a leadership role because everyone has to pull together on this if we want things to change. The impact in places like Africa can be significant. We give a lot of international aid to African countries. Those countries lose much more to tax avoidance and evasion than they receive in international aid. There is a long-term benefit here because if we help them, if we all work together to do away with the schemes that individuals and big corporations are typically involved in, that can help African countries. We would not have to invest as much. There are a lot of knock-on effects to consider here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789713">Dealing with this issue would therefore allow us to recover those resources, and that is very important. However, I would like to point out in closing that this is not simply a matter of resources. It is also a matter of social justice. Taxes are the price that must be paid for living in a civilized world, a democracy with community spirit. Everyone must do their part to the best of their ability. It is therefore a matter of social justice. It is also about democracy because, sooner or later, this practice will jeopardize it. Societies are becoming increasingly unstable because they are no longer able to fund their basic social programs. However, it is almost as though there is a network of people who lives between one tax haven and another without any civic engagement toward the governments of the countries where they do business or toward society in general. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789724">Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my hon. colleague for her very intriguing and inspiring speech. We know that Harper's cuts to the corporate income tax rate did not boost investment in Canada. They did not lead to promised job creation, and they cost the government $12 billion annually. Now, in hearing my colleague say that Canada could be a leader I think of the countless Canadians who are hopefully nodding their heads and agreeing with that; Canadians in precarious work, persons living with disabilities, persons who are struggling with a diagnosis and trying to research Lyme disease. There are countless ways that we could be using this $12 billion. I would love to hear more about the member's ideas on where Canada can be a leader on the international scene. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789726">In fact, we have practically become a tax haven ourselves, right here. We have seen American companies move their head office to Canada in order to pay Canadian taxes, rather than American taxes, without having any real impact on job creation here or any real benefits for Canadians and Canadian workers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789727">I see my Conservative friends applauding. They are applauding a facade, a superficial measure that did not really change anything for Canadians.

I would like her to know that the Conservative Party is all for creating wealth and the possibility of providing social programs. It is a balance that we must work toward achieving. I think that is important. I appreciate the hon. member mentioning that we in the Conservative Party are committed to success and economic prosperity.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789731">Before I go on, I would like to say that I will be sharing my time with my colleague who represents a riding in the beautiful greater Quebec City region, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214472" Type="2">Montmagny—L'Islet—Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup</Affiliation>. We make a very good team in the Quebec City region. It is a very prosperous region because it has the lowest unemployment rate. It is mostly represented by the Conservative Party, the official opposition. I am not sure if that is a sign, but people have access to social programs. We take good care of the entire population.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789732">According to the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214102" Type="2">Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie</Affiliation>, the government has to come clean and disclose all the details in this affair and others like it.</ParaText>

He does excellent work. He is currently going around to talk to businesses. Once again, we in the Conservative party look after the economy. My colleague does so in his riding.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789735">The affair he is referring to is the KPMG scheme and the role of the Canada Revenue Agency. We find ourselves today with this NDP motion to address tax avoidance.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789736">Yes, the public's confidence in our institutions has been undermined. Yes, we must tackle tax evasion. All 338 MPs from all parties probably agree with this statement. However, how do we do that?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789737">We cannot support this motion. Why? Simply because Canadians pay too much in taxes. Whether they are individuals or businesses, Canadian taxpayers are being gouged. We know that high tax rates hurt Canadians who are trying to build a good life for themselves and their families.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789738">I was singing the praises of the riding represented by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="214472" Type="2">Montmagny—L'Islet—Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup</Affiliation>, but my riding, which has a shorter name, has its own vibrant economy. I am very proud to rise in the House to represent the 105,000 residents of my riding. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789739">Thousands of people in my riding get up every morning and go to work. They work very hard, just like people all across this country. They need a little hope and a little help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789740">Tax rates also hurt businesses whether they are small, medium-sized or large, because they have to compete locally, nationally, and globally. Conservatives understand this and are committed to making sure that Canadians keep more of their hard-earned money for themselves.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789741">The motion presented by the hon. member, the NDP finance critic, ignores the heavy burden placed on Canadians. That burden has been getting heavier since the Liberal government came to power.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789742">The NDP cannot say it wants a Canadian economy that is good for all Canadians if it thinks the only battle worth fighting is the one against tax evasion. Vision is vital here. Fighting tax evasion on the one hand while bleeding taxpayers and businesses dry on the other is not good enough because it is not really tackling the problem. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789743">We need to be more pragmatic. We need a balanced policy. We need to ensure that companies will want to set up shop here and that Canadians will see their dreams of starting their own business as achievable, that it is possible to start a business that will be viable and prosperous for the long term.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789744">People have the right to make money here in Canada. That goes without saying. When people make money, it creates wealth and the government benefits from that. I hope this government will manage public funds better than it has done. Only then will we be able to provide social programs to everyone who needs them.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789745">On the one hand, the government says that it cares about the well-being of the middle class. On the other hand, it did not keep its promise to lower taxes for the middle class. Day after day, this government breaks its election promises and misleads Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789746">The Liberals promised to lower the corporate tax rate to 9.5%, but that has not happened. They promised a “modest” deficit of $10 billion. In my view, $10 billion is huge, but for the Liberals, that is modest. Plus, they said that we would return to a balanced budget by the next election, which will be in 2019. What are the forecasts? If nothing changes, that will not happen until 2055. In 2019, during the next election, Canadians should make the right choice. Everyone knows that we have hit a wall when it comes to public finances.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789747">As for the NDP, it does not understand and does not see, or worse does not want to see, that tax evasion is just one part of the equation. The NDP supported not a single one of the tax cuts for small and medium-sized enterprises proposed by the previous government, that of Stephen Harper. The Harper government saw to creating a healthy fiscal environment for businesses thanks to its tax cuts which brought the general corporate income tax rate down from 22% to 15%. It lowered taxes for small businesses and created measures to attract businesses and make them more prosperous, which is the least we could expect, in my opinion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789748">When we acknowledge that small and medium-sized enterprises play a key role in our economy, it becomes clear that the government has to see to stimulating the creation of SMEs and to allowing them not only to survive, but to grow, create jobs, and contribute to the economic growth and prosperity of our great country.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789749">Between 2006 and 2015, Stephen Harper's government lowered taxes 180 times. That is a fact. We brought taxes down to their lowest point in 50 years. That is what Canadians need.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789750">Where are we today? Nearly two years later, the Liberal government is asking Canadians to tighten their belts even more. In budget 2016, the Liberal government rushed to eliminate the tax credits created by the Harper government to help Canadian families. That is not all. Who is going to pay off this massive debt? It is Canadian taxpayers, our children, our grandchildren, and even our great-grandchildren.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789751">Where is the Liberal government's much-talked-about plan, the one it promised during the election campaign? Has Justin Trudeau's economic plan gone up in smoke? It is something that has to be asked. However, in my opinion and that of the Conservative Party, which I am very proud to be a member of, the answer is very clear. The government not only needs to put a stop to tax avoidance by ensuring that all companies and Canadians pay their fair share of taxes, but it also needs to stop gouging Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789752">Between 2006 and 2015, Stephen Harper's government took decisive action to close over 85 tax loopholes, which saved billions of dollars.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789753">I would like to review the parties' positions on eliminating tax havens in the 2015 campaign. The Liberal Party said absolutely nothing. We have become accustomed to the Liberals saying words that mean nothing. It has no plan. As for the NDP, it believes that this could be worthwhile. However, it did not come up with a budget or a plan. As for the Conservative Party, it said that it wold not tolerate white collar crime. It put that in writing. I would remind members that the economic action plan allocated $5 million a year over five years to the Canada Revenue Agency to step up its research. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789754">I am very proud to have risen in the House today. I invite my colleagues to ask questions. I will be pleased to answer them. It is important to create wealth in order to be able to provide social programs. We must see the big picture.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789757">Madam Speaker, my colleague's opposition to the motion comes as no surprise because when I look at the Conservatives' record on fighting tax evasion, the numbers speak volumes.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789758">I am very eager to see if the numbers keep declining like that. In 2006-07, the Canada Revenue Agency referred 214 cases to its criminal investigations program. The Public Prosecution Service of Canada was then able to secure convictions against 213 taxpayers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789759">In 2015-16, 17 cases were referred to the criminal investigations program and taxpayers were convicted. The number of cases went down from 214 to 17, and the number of convictions from 213 to 50. That was on the Conservatives' watch. The main reason has to be the Conservatives' massive cuts to the Canada Revenue Agency. Those cuts prevented the CRA from following up on many cases and getting convictions.</ParaText>

For everyone to pay their fair share, for the average taxpayer to pay their taxes every year, and the rich to also pay their fair share every year seems to be a foreign concept to the Conservatives.

Of the three main parties in the House of Commons, we were the only one to put our plan down on paper, to describe it, and to assign a dollar value to it.

He suggests that our efforts today are to close loopholes in the scams of which we know. The ones we know of total in the hundreds of millions and billions of dollars in forgone revenue every year, which could pay for the things Canadians want, like affordable child care, perhaps pharmacare. Somehow it is wrong to close the loopholes, catch the tax cheats, and make them pay their fare share. That does not sound like Conservative ideology to me. It sounds like something else.

              <ParaText id="4789777">Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214107" Type="2">Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier</Affiliation>, for his speech on the NDP motion on tax evasion that is before us today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789778">Like all Canadians, we are concerned about the individuals and companies that try to dodge their obligations to our country and pay as little as possible in taxes. Everyone is affected by this. Like my colleague just told the House, clearly, all 338 members condemn this practice and are outraged that some individuals take steps to avoid paying taxes or to pay as little as possible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789779">That is why, from 2006 to 2015, the Conservative Harper government took concrete action to deal with the problem. I am talking about initiatives such as the requirement for financial institutions to report funds transfers of $10,000 or more to the Canada Revenue Agency, and the extension of the reassessment period so that the CRA has more time to reassess when certain provisions were not respected, for example, the mandatory reporting of foreign assets. We also implemented the stop international tax evasion program, which encourages Canadians to report fraudsters and even offers incentives when the information provided leads to the recovery of unpaid tax dollars in Canada. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789780">Those are all measures that we brought in, not to mention the legislation to close 85 tax loopholes between 2006 and 2015. This allowed the previous government to recover billions of dollars, and therefore, it also allowed the minister to stand up in the House today to proudly say that she recovered $13 billion last year. The Liberals were elected a year ago, so it is not thanks to any policies they have put in place that the minister can say such a thing; it is thanks to policies that we put in place to combat tax evasion. It also allowed the previous government to recover billions of dollars and to balance the budget without increasing the tax burden on ordinary Canadians. We cannot say the same thing about the current government, which is taxing us more and more.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789781">The Canada Revenue Agency, which receives notices regarding transfers of large sums of money from other countries, can verify whether a taxpayer has properly declared all income earned abroad, and if he has not, the agency can knock on his door and ask him to explain where the money came from.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789782">By encouraging people to report fraudsters, the CRA can now target its investigations thanks to information that would otherwise not have been found. People boast about earning money under the table or hiding money in tax havens all the time. Such individuals say their illegal acts are okay because they already pay enough tax. Well, as they say, loose lips sink ships, and it is now easier for ordinary citizens to report fraudsters thanks to the former Conservative government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789783">I encourage Canadians who have relevant information to call the investigators using the tip line we set up a few years ago at 1-855-345-9042. Ordinary Canadians who witness things they want to report because they feel they are being robbed when others do not pay their taxes can call that number.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789784">Tax evasion costs us all dearly, and we can all do our part to discourage and report it. That said, we have to understand that it is human nature to want to hold on to what we have and try to pay as little tax as possible. Like all Canadians, we always look for the best price on the things we buy. Our initiatives over the past 10 years have borne fruit, but they are just part of the solution.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789785">We need to combat not only tax evasion, but also its root cause. Why do people want to pay less taxes? It is because they pay too much or feel as though they are paying too much. The goal should be to make it useless and redundant to seek out ways to avoid paying taxes. Just look at the new carbon tax, which has just been introduced by the Liberal government. This tax will be applied to all products, because it basically applies to energy and shipping. It will therefore inevitably have an impact on the products and services ordinary Canadians buy every day. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789786">I am talking about the issue of economic competitiveness, which was one of the previous Conservative government's focal points and the key to Canada's success before the Liberals came along.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789787">Under our leadership, the corporate tax rate dropped to 15%, one of the lowest in the G7, making Canada one of the best countries in the world in which to do business in the G20, according to <I>Forbes</I> magazine.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789788">Under those conditions, companies were discouraged from going elsewhere to pay less taxes. At the same time, this also encouraged foreign companies to come and set up shop here.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789789">One of the last, but certainly not the least, examples is Burger King Corporation, which announced in 2014 that it was merging with Tim Hortons and moving its head office to Canada. It would therefore pay taxes here. Why did it decide to put the head office of this new merged firm here in Canada? Because we have competitive tax rates.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789790">This money serves to provide benefits and social programs to all Canadians, as my colleague put it so well earlier. This means more revenue for the state in order to meet the needs of the people, as well as more job opportunities for all Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789791">I find it a bit ironic to see the NDP, through the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214102" Type="2">Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie</Affiliation>, move a motion to denounce tax evasion when its policies would do the opposite. The NDP has always said that it would increase taxes in order to be able to provide more services to all Canadians. That would inevitably make businesses flee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789792">While our government constantly tried to make businesses more competitive, the NDP kept voting against these tax cuts over the past 10 years. In its electoral platform, the NDP even wanted to increase the corporate tax rate from 15% to 17%, and more one day.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789793">Does the hon. member not believe that businesses would want to leave if the NDP formed the government? I have little doubt about it, myself.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789794">The Conservative Party absolutely agrees that we must ensure that Canadians pay their fair share of taxes and that the law is upheld. Everyone agrees with that.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789795">What does the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214102" Type="2">Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie</Affiliation> hope to accomplish with a motion that is purely symbolic? A motion is a good thing. It allows us to have a discussion and share our points of view with the House. However, the reality is that a motion does not change much in the House of Commons. If there are tax loopholes that need to be closed, will the hon. member introduce a private member's bill that identifies precisely which section of the Income Tax Act needs to be amended, repealed, or added? Is he going to propose amendments to the Criminal Code in order to eliminate the practice of penalty-free amnesty?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789796">These are all things that the member could do by introducing a bill in the House. I understand that the member has good intentions, but he is not a journalist at TVA whose job is to criticize without providing solutions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789797">With all due respect, that is the basic difference between two parties that have the opportunity to form a government and lead a country, and a third party that is relegated to being the opposition that criticizes instead of providing real solutions by introducing new legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789798">If a bill with concrete measures were introduced, as good legislators we would definitely take the time to carefully read it and to evaluate its merits.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789799">I find it difficult to support a symbolic and nebulous motion, which makes reference to loopholes and tax deductions and exemptions without identifying them, and which seems to confuse tax avoidance and tax evasion, which are two completely different things.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4789814">Madam Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="214590" Type="2">Skeena—Bulkley Valley</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789815">Last night a constituent wrote to me. She is a senior living in Victoria and had been reading about the CBC's investigation into the KPMG affair. She had heard of the NDP's call for a full investigation and felt the government was stonewalling. She said, “It seems that there's one law for the rich and another law for the poor in Canada.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789816">This motion is about answering her letter. It is about proving to her and to all Canadians that the Liberal government is committed to a fair and equitable tax system without golden loopholes for the super rich. The motion calls on the government to take two simple steps: first, keep its promise and limit the $1 billion a year stock options loophole; and second, tackle the multi-billion dollar problem of tax havens by tightening the rules for shell companies, closing loopholes for international tax treaties, and ending sweetheart amnesty deals for millionaire tax cheats. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789817">Before I get into the details of the motion and the solution it proposes, let us talk about why it matters. This debate touches on two fundamental issues. First, it is about fairness. Specifically, it is about upholding a fair bargain between Canadians, between those who work hard and play by the rules and those who seek a free ride at their neighbour's expense. It is also about something even more fundamental. It is about maintaining and strengthening that basic social bargain that allows us to come together and work collectively for the public good. If we want to build a better, more just, and more prosperous Canada, if we are not content with the status quo, then we must uphold that bargain. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789818">The motion is not just about our arcane tax law or fixing past mistakes; it is about the future. It is about how we can eliminate the deficit and kick-start a sluggish economy by offering working parents affordable child care. It is about how we can support seniors with a pharmacare plan and not outsource their care to Chinese corporations. That is what is at stake when the government lets big corporations and multi-millionaires walk right out the door without paying their bill, leaving ordinary Canadians to pick up the tab.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789819">With this motion, the NDP is proposing solutions. First, the government can make good on its billion dollar broken promise to fix the stock options deduction loophole. It was originally meant to help start-ups take off, but the deduction has now become a free ride for the super rich. Ninety per cent of the benefits of this loophole go to those who make incomes more than a quarter of a million dollars a year. This costs all Canadians about $1 billion a year, and 75¢ of each dollar goes to 8,000 super-rich individuals who use it to trim their tax bill by an average of $400,000 a year. Clearly, there are better uses for this money. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789820">In the last election, the NDP proposed limiting this deduction, protecting its legitimate use for start-ups. We suggested that every dollar saved, all $500 million, be put toward combatting child poverty. The Liberals made a similar promise, but they broke it in budget 2016.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789821"> Failing to close this loophole cost almost $700 million in lost revenue last year alone. If the promise had been kept, the money could have been used, for instance, to make up the shortfall in child welfare services for aboriginal kids, without the NDP having to force the government's hand with an opposition motion like this one. It is long past time to limit this loophole and narrow it back to its original intention, which was to help start-ups attract their first employees. Canadians will be watching on March 22 to see if because of this motion in Parliament the government finally keeps its promise. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789822">The second part of the motion is about tackling tax havens. Again, while Canadians are furious about the government's appallingly lacklustre response to the KPMG affair, the Panama papers, and other such revelations, it is important that they understand this is not just about multinational corporations and unscrupulous millionaires. It also affects small local businesses in our communities. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4789823">In Victoria, I spoke to the owner of a small coffee shop. He told me that his effective tax rate is much bigger than the big Starbucks on the corner. Why? Starbucks is able to access international tax havens and therefore pay an incredibly low rate of tax. As another constituent told me last night, there is one set of rules for the ultra-rich and another set of rules for the rest of us.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789824">Refusing to take action against big corporations that break the rules hurts small businesses, which are the real engine of economic growth and job creation in our country. One solution proposed here is to tighten the rules for shell companies.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789825"> In 2014, I introduced a piece of legislation in the House that would enable the government and our courts to more effectively identify, pursue, and convict tax cheats. To do this, my bill would impose what is called an “economic substance test” on transactions. In other words, a corporation must prove that there is a legitimate business case for transactions beyond simply avoiding paying its fair share of taxes in Canada. There has to be an economic substance. Creating an economic substance test would recover significant uncollected revenue that could support better public services in Canada. When I bring that bill back into this Parliament, I hope the government will support it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789826">The bottom line is simple. There is no shortage of solutions if the government is finally ready to get to work. For instance, nearly four years ago, we worked with the finance committee to study tax evasion and the use of tax havens. In a supplementary report, the NDP members of the finance committee proposed solutions that should have been implemented then and must be implemented now. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789827">At that time, the government testified that no effort was being made to measure the amount of the so-called “tax gap”. We proposed that it do so, and we called on the government to join the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and other countries in measuring the existence of this tax gap. We also asked the Canada Revenue Agency to require corporations to disclose all taxes paid in other jurisdictions so that Canadians could monitor their operations in offshore tax shelters, and we asked the Auditor General to monitor the success of the Canada Revenue Agency in prosecuting and settling cases of tax evasion. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789828">This is information that all Canadians deserve to know. For instance, can the government tell Canadians just how many people have been jailed for tax evasion? How many have been jailed for aggressive international tax dodges? How many prosecutions have been launched? To keep faith in the integrity of our tax system, the public must see that individuals who break the rules are caught and appropriately punished for seeking a free ride at the expense of hard-working, taxpaying Canadians. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789829">We see carpenters and hairdressers named on the Canada Revenue Agency website, but I ask how many international tax cheats we will find there. The answer is zero. When tax cheats go unpunished, it puts a heavier burden on the backs of ordinary Canadians. We will not stand for that, and neither should the government.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789830">In conclusion, I ask all members and Canadians listening at home to remember just how important this is to all of us. A recent Conference Board report estimated that the tax gap of lost revenue could be as high as $47 billion a year. Every dollar of that could be put to use, such as having an affordable child care program, helping seniors get the prescriptions they need through a national pharmacare program, creating new jobs in clean energy, building new infrastructure to ease congestion and support commerce, eliminating the deficit and easing the burden on future generations. However, none of this can be done if the government refuses to take real action, and if we continue to allow Canadians' faith in the fairness of our tax system to be eroded.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789831"> It is in that spirit, with an eye to the future, not just the mistakes of the past, that I urge all members to support this motion.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789848">Madam Speaker, if I had my full time one can only imagine the speech I would have given.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789849">I thank my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="214384" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation> for splitting his time today.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789850">I looked forward to this debate. We in the NDP chose to raise this important issue in one of what are called our opposition day motions. The context is important as we now learn that the government just a couple of weeks from now will unveil its budget to Canadians. A budget, as it is for any Canadian family, as it is for any business, as it is true for a government, is about making choices.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789851">Liberal budgets have been awash in very large debt. It was promised at $10 billion but is going up to $30 billion or more. The budget is likely to be awash in red ink, as they say. One would think in a moment like that the emphasis on going after money owed to the government would be of the highest priority. Would it not be better to get the money from those wealthy Canadians and corporations that are cheating, that are just simply breaking the law? One would think that would be the government's first priority before heaping more debt on to the backs of future generations of Canadians.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789852">We know from such credible sources as The Conference Board of Canada that the tax gap is enormous. It is hard to even comprehend an amount of $47 billion per year. Pulling back from that, we say we have a <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> who prides himself on being the “minister of no”, rejecting money that would make up the funding gap for first nations education, not supplying sufficient money for clean drinking water for every Canadian, saying that affordable pharmacare for seniors and those on fixed incomes is not an option. The Liberals say it is not an option because they do not have money. Did they look? Did they check under the cushions on the sofa to see whether there might be something hiding there? Lo and behold, we know money is hiding.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789853">This has been going on for years and the Liberals are aware of it. In the last election they said that at a time of high deficits and growing inequality between the richest Canadians and middle-class families this is a disproportionate benefit for the wealthy. What were the Liberals talking about? They were talking about this little tax loophole that costs the Canadian government $700 million a year in stock options. The Liberals also admitted in their election platforms in both 2011 and 2015 that this tax loophole overwhelmingly goes to the wealthiest Canadians. This is not about entrepreneurship and that go-getter attitude that we want to incentivize. That is not how this loophole is being used and that is what the NDP motion addresses today. We thought the Liberals were going to address this issue in their last budget. Why? Well, because they promised to address it. They said they would. They put a cap on tax avoiders who are aggressive with their taxes. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789854">There seems to be a disturbing pattern with the Liberals. If one is well connected, if one is able to fork over $1,500 for a cocktail to rub elbows with the PM so to speak, if those individuals could be hosts at a private island then Liberal issues rise to the top. The <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> has lobbied on this issue. Wealthy Canadians have asked him to please not take away this loophole because they love it, those wealthy Canadians who are able to forgo $400,000 a year on average in taxes. Not bad. I guess $1,500 for a ticket to a Liberal fundraiser is worth it if we did a quick cost benefit.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789855">We also know, and we mentioned it in today's motion, that we want to aggressively get at the many tax evasions, the tax avoidances, that come under a number of rubrics, that Canada has become not famous for, but infamous for, that we saw in the Panama papers where the curtain was suddenly pulled back and all the international manipulation of tax regimes was exposed. What was Canada's role in that? What was our reputation? It is called snow washing, a new term we have come across. International accountants advise their international clients that if they do not want to pay taxes, they know that in Canada ownership of a company does not have to be declared but rather could go under a numbered account. If one does not live in Canada, then an individual can set up a company in Canada and declare its profits in another country. It is the perfect place if one wants to set up real action in Barbados, St. Kitts, or wherever it happens to be that income was actually declared because no tax will be paid on it. Canada's reputation just has to be used. These people and companies use the weak and vague laws that we have over corporate governance in this country to hide their money. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789856">We saw this also in the KPMG scam, and there is no other word for it. Even Revenue Canada had the ability to call it what it was. For 13 years KPMG was advising its millionaire clients in Canada that if they wanted to pay taxes they could go ahead and do so, but if those millionaires did not want to pay taxes, they just had to cut KPMG a cheque and it would get their money to a little place called the Isle of Man. </ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4789857">The Isle of Man is famous for concerts and it is also famous for all the fake companies that get set up. Canadian millionaires hired KPMG to set up the scam. When it was finally uncovered and this was starting to unravel internationally, let us compare what happened in the U.S. to what happened here. The Senate called hearings. A half a billion dollar fine was put upon KPMG. It had to admit guilt. Three people were charged criminally and KPMG had to admit this was exactly what they did. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789858">Let us flip it over to the Liberal-dominated committee here. For those who want to listen to the entire story, CBC's radio program, <I>The Current</I>, had this all playing out. It will drive people crazy, as it did my constituents. They wrote me to say that all they expected was basic fairness. When wealthy Canadians avoid paying their taxes, the rest of them, those who follow the rules, have to pick up the tab.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789859"> I will wager that every MP in the House has a horror story of some working-class Canadian, some middle-class Canadian, whom the Liberals are obsessed over, going through an interaction with the Canada Revenue Agency that ends very badly. Regardless of whether the person was in the right or in the wrong, the power of the CRA is incredible.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789860">When this KPMG scam was exposed, no one denied it was going on. Hundreds of millions of dollars were being sent offshore and then gifted back to millionaire families. They are such generous people. They simply moved all their money to the Isle of Man, paid KPMG $100,000, and then were gifted back the money. What a wonderful world these people occupy where they make so much money they feel it is their right and obligation to not pay any taxes for the roads, the services, and the hospitals that we so cherish. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789861">Through all of this, Liberals have said that they have put money into this and that they are getting at it. The Liberals need to back up the rhetoric and back up their promises with actual action, go after the tax cheats and get the money we are all owed so Canadians can finally have the services and the economy they deserve.</ParaText>

            <Content>
              <ParaText id="4789881">Madam Speaker, genetic testing can quite literally save lives. It allows Canadians who suspect that they might be at a higher risk for certain genetic diseases to take early preventive action. Unfortunately, under our current regime, Canadians often refuse to undergo a genetic test, even based on a recommendation from a doctor, because of the fear of genetic discrimination. This fear is not unfounded, as a recent Canadian study found that 40% of individuals with Huntington's disease experience some form of discrimination based on their genetic test results. That discrimination can come in the form of unfair insurance practices, being passed over for a promotion, and even being fired. Unfortunately, there are a number of documented cases of genetic discrimination in Canada, and that number will only continue to grow until we, as parliamentarians, fill that legislative void.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789882">This is not only an issue of discrimination but is a legitimate public health issue. If Canadians continue to fear genetic tests because of the lack of legal protection from discrimination, they will be unable to access the best possible health care options available. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789883">It is also important to note that a number of developed countries around the world have a regulatory system in place to protect their citizens from genetic discrimination. Many of our counterparts around the world, such as France, Germany, and Spain, all have legislative frameworks to protect the genetic privacy of their citizens and to guard against genetic discrimination. The U.K. and the U.S. also have some systems in place, whether it is a moratorium placed on the use of genetic information by insurance companies or a prohibition against genetic discrimination in health insurance and employment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789884">Unfortunately, Canada lags behind these countries on this important issue, and our laws have not kept pace with science when it comes to genetic testing. With the passing of this legislation without amendment, we would be able to provide support and protections for our citizens, as some of our international counterparts do. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789885">I would be remiss in my remarks if I did not mention the insurance industry claims that premiums will rise if this important piece of legislation passes. That concern has been addressed, because this bill does not even contain the word "insurance". Although it is true that previous versions of the bill did contain insurance-specific provisions, they have been removed to address concerns about adverse selection and the constitutional issues that would arise because of it.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789886"> It is also important to note that in countries where similar legislation has been passed, the insurance industry has not been adversely affected or as severely damaged as feared. Research would also suggest that this would apply here in Canada as well. In fact, that assertion was confirmed by the Privacy Commissioner in July 2014, when he stated at a Senate committee that “the impact of a ban on the use of genetic test results by the life and health insurance industry would not have a significant impact on insurers or the efficient operation of insurance markets”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789887">Peter Hogg, a pre-eminent constitutional law expert, spoke in front of the justice committee on Bill <Document DbId="8063160" Type="4">S-201</Document> and has also written on this topic in his book <I>Constitutional Law of Canada</I>. In it he states that “The authority to enact legislation of this kind is distributed between the federal Parliament and the provincial legislatures according to which has jurisdiction over the employment, accommodation, restaurants and other businesses or activities, in which discrimination is forbidden. Most of the field is accordingly provincial under property and civil rights in the province. However, there is little doubt that the federal Parliament could if it chose exercise its criminal law power...to outlaw discriminatory practices generally.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789888"> Any debate on this issue must, of course, recognize the important role the provinces play. In Mr. Hogg's testimony to the Standing Committee on Justice, he pointed out that the double aspect doctrine was relevant, because there are other precedents where the criminal law power has been exercised. Mr. Hogg used the example of the Highway Traffic Act, where the federal government enacted criminal law while the provinces enact prohibitions related to property and civil rights.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="30">(1730)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4789889">He further clarified that this legislation would “simply be making it an offence to discriminate on the basis of genetic characteristics”. This is something I agree with wholeheartedly, and I feel Canadians want a national standard not to be discriminated against because of their genetic makeup. This is something I agree with and I hope that the House will, as I said earlier, fill that void.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789890">It is also important to note that this legislation has the support of organizations like the ALS Society of Canada, the Alzheimer Society of Canada, the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation, the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, the Canadian Human Rights Commission, Parkinson Canada, and the Huntington Society of Canada, along with many of my own constituents. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789891">As I mentioned earlier, patients with Huntington's disease are among the most likely to experience degenerative discrimination. It is crucial that we as parliamentarians do all we can to protect Canadians from genetic discrimination and modernize our existing laws to ensure we keep pace with developed countries around the world. I am honoured to have the opportunity to speak on Bill <Document DbId="8063160" Type="4">S-201</Document> here tonight and proud to lend it my full support.</ParaText>

Various countries, including the members of the G7, have already adopted measures to prohibit any such discrimination. Unfortunately, Canada has not yet adopted this type of measure. Bill <Document DbId="8063160" Type="4">S-201</Document> in its entirety, without the amendments proposed by the government party, seeks to bridge that gap.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789917">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my profound disappointment with the Liberal government's decision to gut legislation intended to protect Canadians from genetic discrimination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789918"> Such legislation is essential to ensure that Canadians can make use of genetic testing, without fear, to improve their health care planning and treatment options. With approximately 48,000 genetic tests now available, no Canadian should have to forgo using these critical tools because they lacked effective legal protection from discrimination. That is exactly what the Liberal government has decided Canadians will have to suffer.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789919">The original version of Bill <Document DbId="8063160" Type="4">S-201</Document> proposed to make amendments to the Canada Labour Code and the Canadian Human Rights Act, while introducing a series of new offences and penalties for genetic discrimination in a stand-alone act and to prevent discrimination in contracts in the provision of goods and services. However, the Liberal government's amendments to Bill S-201 have deleted all provisions forbidding mandatory genetic testing and mandatory disclosure of test results, as well as proposed employee protections under the Canada Labour Code. The only provision remaining from the original version of Bill <Document DbId="8063160" Type="4">S-201</Document> would make genetic characteristics a discriminatory motive under the Canadian Human Rights Act.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789920">Currently, there is no law in place that protects the genetic privacy of Canadians. This puts Canada out of step with its major industrial counterparts. By eviscerating Bill <Document DbId="8063160" Type="4">S-201</Document>, the Liberal government is maintaining a serious legislative gap on genetic discrimination that does not exist in any of our G7 partners.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789921">Canada's New Democrats agree that the federal government can, and must, do more to provide comprehensive protection from genetic discrimination for every Canadian. That is why we strongly supported Bill <Document DbId="8063160" Type="4">S-201</Document> when it was first introduced in the House. That is why New Democratic MPs introduced similar legislation on three previous occasions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789922">Simply put, the Liberal government has utterly neutered Bill <Document DbId="8063160" Type="4">S-201</Document> and, more important, the rights of all Canadians by eliminating the first ever nationwide protections and penalties against genetic discrimination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789923">Let us take a closer look at exactly what the Liberal government is proposing to do to the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789924">The original version of Bill <Document DbId="8063160" Type="4">S-201</Document> would have enacted a new statute, the genetic non-discrimination act, prohibiting any requirement that would force an individual to take a genetic test or disclose the results of a genetic test. Further, it would have prohibited anyone from collecting or using the results of a person's genetic test without the person's written consent as a condition of providing goods or services to the person, entering into or continuing a contract with the person or offering or continuing particular terms or conditions in a contract with the person. Researchers and practitioners providing health services would have been exempt from this aspect of the legislation.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789925">The original version of Bill <Document DbId="8063160" Type="4">S-201</Document> would have made changes to the Canada Labour Code to prohibit federally regulated employers from taking disciplinary action against an employee because the employee refused the employer's request to take a genetic test or reveal the results of a previous test. The original bill would have also amended federal privacy legislation to make it clear that “personal information” would include information derived from genetic testing. Breaking the law would have been a criminal offence, punishable by fines and imprisonment.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789926">In other words, the original bill would have provided Canadians with protection against discrimination on the basis of their genetic makeup. It would have protected Canadians from being forced to disclose genetic information to insurance companies and their employers. However, the Liberal government has stripped those protections from the bill.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789927">In doing so, it is important to note that the Liberals are ignoring, indeed, countermanding, the overwhelming weight of testimony at both the House Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights and the Senate Standing Committee on Human Rights. Before both bodies, the vast majority of witnesses supported the legislation as originally proposed. This view was echoed by the Canadian Coalition for Genetic Fairness, a diverse alliance of organizations that advocate on behalf of the families directly affected by genetic conditions, folks who are witnessing the disturbing prevalence of genetic discrimination first hand.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789928">As stated, the only provision that the Liberal government has chosen to maintain is to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act to include genetic characteristics as a prohibited ground of discrimination.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4789929">Unfortunately, this provision is arguably the weakest of the protections contained in the original text of the bill. As Marie-Claude Landry, the chief commissioner of the Canadian Human Rights Commission told the justice committee: </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789931">This is deeply disappointing to all those who believe in rights. It will create fear that Canadians will not qualify for insurance coverage. It will compel employees to provide their employers or prospective employers with personal information that may then be used to deny them employment. Worse, it will cause Canadians to decline to get tested for many conditions, to avoid creating a record that may someday be used against them. This will harm Canadians' health and set back critical treatment and research into many genetically influenced diseases. </ParaText>

On the contrary, Bill S-201's constitutionality was confirmed by a number of constitutional experts who testified before Parliament, including Peter Hogg, perhaps the leading authority on Canadian constitutional law. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789936">One critical piece of evidence reveals in stark manner the nonsense of the government's constitutional excuse. The Liberal government has removed the bill's employment protections from the Canada Labour Code, which applies solely and completely to Canadians in federally regulated jurisdiction.

I applaud Senator Cowan for his efforts for many years on this issue and my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214013" Type="2">Don Valley West</Affiliation>, who has been a tireless advocate to end genetic discrimination.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789942">With this bill, we have the historic opportunity to join all other G7 countries that already have legislation that protects its citizens from discrimination based on their genetics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789943">As we have heard, the bill has three components, each of which is critical to the new genetic non-discrimination bill, which would make it a criminal offence for a service provider to require genetic testing or that a person disclose results of past testing. The second part would amend the Canada Labour Code to set up a complaint procedure for those working in federally regulated industries. Finally, it would amend the Canadian Human Rights Act to add the words “genetic discrimination”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789944">The proposed amendments would remove two of these three components of the bill and could leave more 90% of Canadians with a false sense of security that they are indeed protected. As we know, only 5% to 7% of Canadians are covered by the Canadian Human Rights Act, so most would still remain without protections with the government's proposed amendments.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789945">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="214013" Type="2">Don Valley West</Affiliation> shared a timeline that highlights the rapid changes taking place in genetic testing. In 2003, scientists first mapped the human genome. Then there were 100 genetic tests for diseases or conditions. When Senator Cowan first spoke about this issue in the Senate 10 years later, the number of tests had jumped to 2,000. Today that number has skyrocketed to almost 35,000, with tests available for more than 10,000 conditions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789946">The Canadian Coalition for Genetic Fairness is a group of 18 organizations dedicated to establishing protections from genetic discrimination for all Canadians. Members include the ALS Society of Canada, the Alzheimer Society of Canada, Muscular Dystrophy Canada, the MS Society of Canada, Osteoporosis Canada, and 13 more. They have stated that cases of genetic discrimination have been documented in Canada and are continuing to grow. As they remind us, all Canadians are impacted by genetic discrimination. Each of us has dozens of genetic mutations that could increase or decrease our risk of getting diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer, Parkinson's, or Alzheimer's disease.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789947"> While I was aware that genetic testing was available, like most Canadians I had not given it a lot of thought. While I knew that my father's colon cancer made it more likely for me to develop the same cancer, there was not a genetic test available for that particular cancer. I knew about the BRCA gene and its connection to breast and ovarian cancer, but it was not until last year, when I had a meeting with Ovarian Cancer Canada, that I was shocked to learn of the discrimination that is taking place in our country based on genetics.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789948">Ovarian cancer is an insidious disease that is notoriously hard to detect. There is no reliable early detection test. It is the third most common reproductive cancer in women and one of the most deadly. I was told the story of two sisters who had a history of ovarian cancer in their family. Their doctors recommended genetic testing, as their prognosis would greatly improve with the knowledge gained from these tests. One sister had the testing, was positive for the gene, and had surgery to remove her ovaries. The other sister was told her insurance would be cancelled if she tested positive, so despite the fact that the test could potentially save her life, she was afraid to risk losing her insurance and did not get genetic testing.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789949"> Just last night, I received a letter from a constituent who wished to stay anonymous out of fear of discrimination. She disclosed that she and her daughter had a genetic test that found that they both had a gene that could leave them blind. She questioned the fairness of allowing a simple genetic test to undermine her future access to employment and insurance, and she worried about her daughter and the effect it could have on her career and future. She reminded me that we live in Canada, a country where we celebrate our differences. We protect one another from race, colour, sex, and disability discrimination.</ParaText>

In fact, the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, a member of the Canadian Coalition for Genetic Fairness, which appeared as a witness before the justice committee, stated, “It is time for the law to catch up with science and bring an end to genetic discrimination”. On its website, it highlights that governments continue to invest billions in promising genome research, but the benefits of this research will be diminished or degraded due to genetic discrimination. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789957"> I suspect most Canadians would be shocked that their genetic test results could be used to discriminate in employment, insurance, and even divorce cases.

This is just wrong. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789966">This is an important bill substantively, but I think it also signals an important moment in the life of this Parliament. It speaks to the opportunity that we have as individual members either to stand up for a cause that is important, and indeed to stand up for the importance of the role of members of Parliament, of the work we do in committee and elsewhere, or perhaps it will be a moment when too many members roll over to pressure from the front bench. I want to talk a bit about that context and then speak about the substantive portion of the bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789967">This is a bill that was approved unanimously in this place at second reading on October 26. All members of all parties supported it at that time. Of course, it is fair for members to support in principle legislation which they then want to see amendments to and then to subsequently vote against it at third reading. However, it is worth noting that at the time, this reflected a very strong consensus of members.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789968">The bill was studied in detail at the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights under the very able chairmanship of my friend from <Affiliation DbId="214027" Type="2">Mount Royal</Affiliation>. All of the clauses of the bill were approved in committee. I understand the committee heard from many different witnesses, did a detailed analysis of the bill, and reported it back recommending support. Then, much to the surprise of members here, we had the government, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214526" Type="2">Edmonton Centre</Affiliation>, notably the former parliamentary secretary for Canadian heritage, not even somebody responsible ostensibly for anything related to this file, put forward amendments which gut the bill. These amendments were to delete every single clause. When he moved these amendments, he noted that they had not been considered at committee.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789969"> Of course, as other members have pointed out already, committees do not consider amendments to delete clauses. They vote on clauses in whole. That is the time when members of the committee can consider whether or not to include a particular clause in the bill. Every one of those clauses was approved by the members of the committee, which of course includes Liberal members of the committee. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789970">This eleventh hour amendment coming from the government was not simply a matter of the parliamentary secretary showing disregard for the work of the opposition. He was showing disregard for the work of all members of the House, including government members who had worked very hard on this piece of legislation. This bill was moved by a Liberal member, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214013" Type="2">Don Valley West</Affiliation>, who has worked very hard on this issue. Many other members of the government have spoken passionately, and I think very effectively, about the merits of this bill. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789971"> I say to members who are considering how they will vote when this comes up that this is really an important opportunity to send a signal about the role of members of Parliament in this place and where we stand when it comes to what our responsibilities are. We are not here as delegates of a political party, at least not principally. We are not here as members of some electoral college that simply chooses the prime minister, who then chooses the cabinet. We are here to speak on behalf of our individual constituents and to articulate our convictions which reflect their convictions. We have a responsibility to the people who sent us here and to this institution to exercise our considered judgment in the votes we take.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789972"> I know it is not always easy to vote against a recommendation that comes from one's party, but especially on matters of grave importance such as this that deal with fundamental human rights and discrimination, we have a responsibility to exercise our considered judgment here and vote on behalf of our constituents. I know there are some members of the government who are prepared to do this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789973"> I hope that we will see this very good legislation pass. It is legislation that was recognized to be constitutional, the value of which was recognized by the committee, and was recognized here at second reading. I hope we will proceed with it again as a recognition of the importance of this legislation, but also as a recognition of the importance of members of Parliament and the value of the work that was done. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789974">The committee study process and the debates that have happened in this place, these are not mere matters of form. These are important venues and opportunities for actual discussion and consideration. When all of those discussions point to the importance of the bill and the value of approving it, surely we have a responsibility as members to consider that, take it on board and support it, not to sanction this eleventh hour gutting attempt by the government, moved by a member not even given specific responsibility, as far as we know, for this file.</ParaText>
              <Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp>
              <ParaText id="4789975">That said, recognizing the importance of where we are procedurally, I would like to speak as well about the substantive aspects of the bill. The bill addresses genetic discrimination. There are genetic tests that individuals can have. They give them information about themselves, and their predisposition, perhaps, to contract certain health problems later in life. However, it is currently legal for employers, for insurers, for others, to use that information to discriminate against individuals.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789976">This is a form of discrimination like any other. We do not accept discrimination in this country and we should not accept it in the case of genetic discrimination. It is a basic extension of our well-established norms of human rights protection. However, there are additional points about genetic discrimination that should underline the importance of passing this legislation, because not only is this a form of discrimination at a basic simple level, but this kind of discrimination discourages research and it discourages people from getting tested. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789977">Right now, if a person receives more information about their genetic makeup that may help them understand what they might experience in the future, that information could be used against them, which creates perhaps a disincentive for them to gather that information. It also creates a disincentive for those who might be looking to help people with a particular genetic ailment, a disincentive to do research, knowing that their research might be used to discriminate against the people they are actually trying to help.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789978">This reality, that the current law allows this kind of discrimination, could well, as the science advances, put a disincentive in place for people who want to get tested and for people who want to do research. Yes, we recognize that this is a form of discrimination, but it is also particularly pernicious insofar as it can put a chill on that research, a chill on people getting information that would be useful to them.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789979">There is a simple response to this. We can pass well-drafted legislation that experts at the committee recognize because it is in the constitutional jurisdiction of the federal government. We can address this discrimination and we can at the same time remove these chilling elements.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789980">I should also underline that for those who think there is some fundamental, unforeseen problem to moving forward with this, Canada is an outlier. We are the only G7 nation that does not have laws with respect to genetic discrimination, and usually we think of Canada as a leader in combatting discrimination. In fact in this case, we are an outlier and it is Canada that needs to catch up, and unfortunately, some members of the government do not seem to want to see that happen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789981">We have a common-sense bill before us that addresses discrimination, that helps us to catch up with the rest of the world, and that also opens the door for expanded research and makes it easier to choose to get tested. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789982">We will have a vote on the bill tomorrow, and I hope every member of Parliament will vote in favour, but at least I hope that every member of Parliament will actually take the time to study the legislation, to consider what was said at committee, to consult the members of their party who were on the committee and who were a part of that study. We all have that responsibility, not just to look at the recommendation we get and sail in that direction, but to really think through the impact of this.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789983"> I think what the government has tried to do is wrong, trying to, at the 11th hour, undercut the important work that was done by the committee and done by this House is not the right way to proceed. This is the right bill to move forward and this is an opportunity for members of Parliament to emphasize the importance of our role as delegates on behalf of our constituents and as people responsible to exercise our own considered judgment. I would encourage all members to vote in favour of the bill.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4789997">Mr. Speaker, on November 14, 2016, I rose in the House to ask the former Minister of Foreign Affairs why he blocked a shipment of weapons to Thailand because of human rights concerns, which was a very good thing, but approved the sale of weapons to Saudi Arabia, even if it has an even worse human rights record, if that is possible, and in spite of the actions of Saudi Arabia in Yemen.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789998">I also asked him when he would accept the idea of creating a parliamentary committee to examine Canadian arms sales on an ongoing basis given that the Liberals promised transparency during their mandate. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4789999">I did not really get an answer. We all know that it is question period and not necessarily answer period, but the minister did inform me of Canada's intent to sign the Arms Trade Treaty. Since then, the government has continued to ignore us when we have asked for greater transparency.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790000">The situation in Yemen has drastically deteriorated. Two-thirds of the population, or 19 million people, needs humanitarian aid and the government remains silent.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790001">We also learned that the former Minister of Foreign Affairs at the time was not suitably made aware of the human rights situation before approving the sale of arms to Saudi Arabia.

              <ParaText id="4790007">Mr. Speaker, let me first say how encouraging it is to see the members of this House, as well as all Canadians, sharing the government's concerns about maintaining the highest standards on issues of peace, security, and human rights around the world.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4790008">Regarding Canada's export regime, all applications for permits to export controlled goods or technology are carefully reviewed against the full range of Canada's defence in foreign policy interests. The objective of this review is to ensure that exports from Canada do not cause harm to Canada or to our allies, do not undermine national or international security, do not contribute to regional conflicts or instability, do not contribute to the development of weapons of mass destruction or their means of delivery, that they are not used to commit violation of human rights, and that they are consistent with economic sanctions.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790009">Our controls are in line with those of our allies and of our partners. However, we have heard the concerns of Canadians and we are fully committed to making Canada's export control regime even stronger. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790010">On June 17, 2016, our government tabled the Arms Trade Treaty in the House of Commons, something that the previous Conservative government failed to do. Canada's accession to the Arms Trade Treaty will further enhance transparency in the export controls process, while not putting Canadian companies at a commercial disadvantage.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790011"> Let me remind the member and all Canadians that the Canadian defence industry provides 70,000 Canadian jobs. Canadians rightly deserve and expect a fair and level playing field. However, Canadians also expect us to live up to our commitment to promote responsibility, transparency, and accountability. This is the right thing to do and we will soon be introducing legislation to this regard. When we do introduce the legislation, members of the House, including my colleague opposite, will have an opportunity to study, analyze, and contribute to this discussion.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790012">I look forward to hearing from the member opposite as well as collaborating with her, so Canada can successfully accede to the Arms Trade Treaty. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790013">Furthermore, Canadians will soon see the results of new transparency measures that will be put in place in the form of enhancements to our annual reports to Parliament on the administration of the Export and Import Permits Act and on military exports from Canada. We committed to being more transparent and accountable, and we will deliver. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790014">With respect to the export contract of light armoured vehicles to Saudi Arabia, let me remind the House that this contract was signed under the Conservative government in February 201. All three parties, including the NDP, committed during the 2015 election campaign to respect this contract. To quote the leader of the NDP, “You don't cancel a commercial accord retroactively, it's just not done”. Unlike the NDP, we are sticking to our word in honouring the contract, but will also further enhance transparency and accountability in this regard. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790015">Regarding Saudi Arabia's human rights record, are we passive? Absolutely not. Our government takes every opportunity to raise critical issues with senior Saudi officials like humanitarian issues, consular cases, and universal human rights. We have raised these issues directly with the king, the crown prince, the minister of foreign affairs and other ministers of state, and the president of the Saudi human rights commission. We will never shy away from the opportunity to promote human rights both at home and abroad.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4790024">Mr. Speaker, the Liberal government likes to boast about supposedly unprecedented consultation with Canadians but exactly who did the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> consult before changing insured mortgage rules? I can tell the House who he did not consult. He did not consult the mortgage or the housing industries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790025">On February 1 I attended the Standing Committee on Finance to hear witnesses discuss the effects that mortgage rule changes are having on their businesses, their customers, and Canada's many regional housing markets. One point was absolutely clear: none of them had been consulted.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790026">Here are some of the things that the finance committee heard that the minister would have heard had he bothered to ask:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790027">He would have heard from many witnesses that the new rules will reduce competition, leading to higher interest rates and fewer options for Canadian consumers.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790028">He would have heard from Michael Lloyd of DLC Canadian Mortgage Experts that the new rules are, “not even effective in Vancouver and Toronto. You're bludgeoning everyone and it's not fixing a thing.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790029">He would have heard from Paul Taylor of Mortgage Professionals Canada that, “The spin-off impacts of a reduction in purchasing power for the middle class could have the unintended consequence of creating the scenario that these policies aim to prevent, which is a national debt crisis caused by a significant economic decline.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790030">He would have heard from Stephen Smith of First National Financial that the insured mortgage stress test will, “reduce the affordability of housing for first-time homebuyers in the softer markets in the country—the Prairies, Quebec, and Atlantic Canada—and will have a minimal effect on the overheated markets in Vancouver and Toronto.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790031">He would have heard from the President of Canada Guaranty Mortgage Insurance that, “elevated housing market activity in Toronto or Vancouver is not and has not been driven by the first-time homebuyer.”</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790032">He would have heard from Bob Finnigan of the Canadian Home Builders' Association that measures like the stress test can, “lock out otherwise qualified homebuyers, they can cause a downward spiral in local economies.” </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790033">He would have heard from Sherry Donovan of the Nova Scotia Home Builders' Association that a mortgage lender she knows in Newfoundland estimated that 25% to 30% of its clients would not qualify under the new rules. She would have told him that a Newfoundland homebuilder reported that he went from an average of 50 home sales between October and December each year down to zero sales for the same time period once the new rules came into effect.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790034">The minister would also have heard from the Canadian Homebuilders' Association that the cost of a home in Toronto has increased by $300,000 over the past few years due largely to government regulations, fees, and taxes.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4790040">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to answer that question.</ParaText>
              <FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage>
              <ParaText id="4790041">The government fully appreciates the challenges faced by middle-class Canadians and those who are working so hard to join the middle class. This includes middle-class families' concerns over reduced housing affordability in some regions and taking on high levels of debt, reducing the likelihood that they will be able to afford their properties over the long term if economic circumstances were to change. Those who already own their homes want to know that the market is stable and that the most important investment they have made in their life is safe. This why our government has been focused on housing issues since coming into office. We have taken a series of carefully targeted measures to ensure stability and to promote affordability.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790042"> Effective since February 15, 2016, the minimum down payment of a new insured mortgage increased from 5% to 10% for the portion of the house price above $500,000. In October, the government made changes to the mortgage insurance rules and tax measures to help ensure that new homebuyers are more resilient and that the principal-residence exemption is only claimed in appropriate cases. These measures are focused on addressing the buildup of housing debt across Canada. This includes markets such as Vancouver and Toronto, which have seen significant house price increases, but also other areas of the country where buying activity is more modest but new buyers are highly indebted. These measures will require borrowers and lenders to make adjustments in the short term and are expected to lead to a temporary reduction in housing activity. However, they are important in containing risk to preserve the long-term stability of the housing market.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790043"> The government is also committed to doing its part to fully understand the range of factors impacting regional housing markets. This is why in budget 2016 we provided funding to Statistics Canada to develop a methodology for gathering data on purchases of Canadian housing by foreign homebuyers. The <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> also created the federal, provincial, and municipal working group of officials to review the range of factors affecting regional housing markets. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790044">Finally, the government is engaging on housing affordability to support the needs of our most vulnerable population. In budget 2016, the Government of Canada spent $2.3 billion on affordable housing. It will continue to work closely with the provinces and municipalities on this file. My colleague the <Affiliation DbId="214330" Type="4">Minister of Families, Children and Social Development</Affiliation> is currently developing a housing strategy. We have seen in other countries what can happen to the housing market and economy when housing risks and the leverage are not appropriately managed. In these situations, it is often middle-class families who suffer the most. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790045">It will take time before we can fully assess the impact of all of these measures, and the government is closely monitoring housing and mortgage markets across the country. Measures that ensure a sound and stable housing market and financial security for Canadian families are a part of the government's economic plan, which is based on the notion that, when we have an economy that works for the middle class, we have a country that works for everyone. The series of actions the government has taken over the course of the past year demonstrates our commitment to protecting the long-term financial security for Canadians. </ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4790046">Mr. Speaker, the government is stating that it is concerned about the affordability of housing for Canadians; yet the measures the Liberals have taken have done absolutely nothing to address this issue in the pockets of concern that they have identified in Vancouver and Toronto, according to the experts who have testified at the finance committee; and they are taking the dream of home ownership away from a substantial number of would-be first-time homebuyers in markets like Calgary, Victoria, cities of southern Ontario outside of the GTA, and especially Atlantic Canada, as was put very forcefully at the finance committee by the Nova Scotia Home Builders' Association. It is the same government that is running an absolutely out of control deficit, has in this House used low interest rates as a justification for doing so, and is lecturing homebuyers about the risks of credit.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4790047">Mr. Speaker, investing in a home is the single largest and most important financial decision most Canadians will make in their lives. Home ownership is vital to the economic and financial health of Canada and middle-class families. It is vital that we do what we can to ensure that the market is stable and that we provide peace of mind to homeowners all across Canada. The government continues to work collaboratively to address housing affordability and stability issues. We are closely monitoring the impact of recent policy measures and are committed to addressing the overall health and stability of the housing market across Canada, financial systems, and the economy.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4790048">Mr. Speaker, the government's own definition of the safe third country agreement with the U.S. states:</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790049">
                <Quote>
                  <QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> Only countries that respect human rights and offer a high degree of protection to asylum seekers may be designated as safe third countries. </QuotePara>
                </Quote>
              </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790050"> However, it is clear that many refugees no longer feel that the U.S. is a safe country for them because of Trump's discriminatory edicts, fuelled by his anti-refugee and Islamophobic rhetoric. Trump's first attempt with his discriminatory immigration ban was quickly struck down by the U.S. court system. However, a new order was issued just yesterday, and frankly, the new order is still discriminatory and the impact of that will be felt in Canada.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790051">To date, we have seen the numbers at irregular crossings spike, more than doubled and in some cases tripled, since Trump was elected. Some people suffered frostbite and had their fingers and toes amputated. People crossing have included families with babies and toddlers, and pregnant women. In one of those crossings, a toddler said to his mom that he could not go on anymore. He said that he wanted to die and asked his mother to go on to Canada without him.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790052">Let us be clear. People are doing this because they are desperate. For them the U.S. is no longer a safe country and they no longer feel that they could have a fair hearing about their claim in the U.S. This sentiment was verified by Amnesty International which surveyed 30 asylum seekers from the U.S. and all 30 said that they had no intention of coming to Canada, that is, until Trump.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790053">These crossings are dangerous for asylum claimants and distressing for many Canadians. Suspending the agreement would allow refugee claimants to be processed through official border crossings in an orderly fashion. Honestly, I do not know what it takes for the Liberal government to act. Are we waiting for another tragedy? The death of Alan Kurdi prompted the Liberals to make their campaign promise to resettle Syrian refugees. Are we waiting for a child to die in the snow before we will act?</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790054">Groups calling for the suspension of the safe third country agreement include Amnesty International, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, the B.C. Civil Liberties Association, the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers, the Canadian Council for Refugees, and a group of some 200 law professors from universities across Canada. In fact, a report from Harvard Law School's immigration and refugee law clinic concluded that the U.S. “is not a 'safe country of asylum' for those fleeing persecution and violence”.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790055">New Democrats will continue to call on the Liberals to suspend the enforcement of the safe third country agreement. The government needs to evaluate whether the U.S. asylum law, policies, and practices comply with the 1951 Refugee Convention and other international human rights obligations. If we do nothing, we are complicit with Trump's discriminatory ban. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790056">In addition, the Liberals need to stand up for Canadians of visible and religious minorities who are being targeted and discriminated against at the border. A young Moroccan student travelling with his team to compete at a sporting event was singled out and interrogated for five hours before he was denied entry. He was asked about his parents, even though they were not travelling with him, and his phone was searched. A Moroccan woman was questioned for hours intrusively about her religion and about her opinion of Trump before she was turned away. An Afghan Canadian doctor was interrogated for five hours and ultimately refused entry as well.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790057">Just yesterday, it was reported that a young Indo-Canadian woman who was trying to go to the U.S. for a one-day spa trip with her girlfriends was singled out, interrogated, and reduced to tears before she was refused entry. It was reported that the border agent actually said, “I know you may feel like you've been Trumped” before informing her she needed an immigrant visa to travel to the U.S.</ParaText>

              <ParaText id="4790061">The safe third country agreement is based on the principle that individuals should seek asylum in the first country they arrive in. This principle is accepted by the United Nations Refugee Agency. It is important to note that the safe third country agreement applies only to refugee claimants who are seeking entry to Canada from the U.S. via land border only, and does not apply to asylum claims made inland. It also does not apply to claims made by people intercepted while entering Canada at a place that is not a legal point of entry. </ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790062">Foreign nationals from any country may make a claim for asylum in Canada. Immigration officers receiving a refugee claim will decide whether the claim is eligible for referral to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, an independent administrative tribunal that makes decisions on immigration and refugee matters.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790063"> The Immigration and Refugee Board decides who is a convention refugee or a person in need of Canada’s protection. Once a claim is made, individuals may also apply for social assistance which is the responsibility of provinces and territories.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790064">The safe third country agreement remains an important tool for Canada and the U.S. to work together on the orderly handling of refugee claims made in our countries.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790065">As the minister mentioned yesterday in the House, the head of the UNHCR in Canada is on record as stating that the domestic asylum system in the United States is intact, and therefore it would be irresponsible, and I did say irresponsible, to withdraw from the safe third country agreement.</ParaText>
              <ParaText id="4790066">Having said that, if the NDP would like to have discussions with the High Commission, whose team has very specialized knowledge of this area, it is free to do so. We will continue to monitor this evolving situation and we are working with the United States as it reviews parts of its resettlement program.</ParaText>
