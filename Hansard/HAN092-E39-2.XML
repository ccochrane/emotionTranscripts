David Emerson (Minister of International Trade and Minister for the Pacific Gateway and the Vancouver-Whistler Olympics, CPC) </Affiliation></PersonSpeaking><Content><ProceduralText TocType="TPC" id="1">Bill C-55. Second reading</ProceduralText><ParaText id="1082403"> moved that Bill <Document DbId="3460693" Type="3">C-55, An Act to implement the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the States of the European Free Trade Association (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland), the Agreement on Agriculture between Canada and the Republic of Iceland, the Agreement on Agriculture between Canada and the Kingdom of Norway and the Agreement on Agriculture between Canada and the Swiss Confederation</Document>, be read the second time and referred to a committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082404">He said: Mr. Speaker, it is a great honour for me to stand in the House today and lead off debate on this trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082405">It is important when we debate our trade relationships to bear in mind that Canada has been, is now and always will be a highly trade dependent country. Indeed, there is probably not a member in the House or a person in Canada who is not dramatically affected by Canada's trade and Canada's trade performance. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082406">I should note that we are unlike the United States, for example, as we are nearly two and a half times more trade dependent than the United States. We have a domestic market of 34 million people compared to nearly 400 million in the United States. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082407">Trade is Canada's lifeblood. We can look at the forces of protectionism, which will be damaging to the United States over time if they continue, and we can see that if such forces were to be unleashed in Canada, I can assure hon. members it would be not just hurtful but devastating to Canada. Therefore, it is critically important that Canada continue to develop trade relationships such as the one we are debating today.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082408">As you have noted, Mr. Speaker, this agreement is with four countries: Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. It is really a milestone in terms of Canadian trade policy. It is a milestone for a couple of reasons.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082409">First, it is really our first substantial trade agreement in over a decade. Canada had a small agreement with Costa Rica in 2001, but I have to tell hon. members that the trade and investment numbers between Canada and the EFTA countries are nearly 30 times that of our relationship with Costa Rica. Really, our previous most significant trade agreement was back in 1996-97, when we made the deal with Chile.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082410">We can look at the trade numbers and see that the combined exports and imports between Canada and the EFTA countries were over $13 billion in 2007. That is of course higher than our trade with Korea. It is a very substantial volume of trade and has grown rapidly in recent years. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082411">When we look at foreign direct investment, we can see that two way investment flows between Canada and the EFTA countries are in the $28 billion range as of 2007. While people may make light of the fact that this is not a deal with the entire European Union, which would be our next priority on that side of the Atlantic, this is a very significant trade deal. These countries are relatively wealthy. Their GDP per capita is among the highest in the industrial world. They are technologically advanced countries. As I say, it is our first trade deal with a European bloc or country in terms of our bilateral free trade agreements.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082412">When we look at it strategically for both countries, we can see that this is a trade deal that allows the EFTA countries to think of Canada as a gateway to the entire North American market, a market of 440 million people, and it allows Canadian businesses to look at the EFTA countries as a gateway into the European Union, because the EFTA countries do have a free trade arrangement with the European Union.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082413">It is also important because Canada, and I think the majority of Canadians, most provinces and certainly the Government of Canada, is anxious to deepen our economic relationship with the larger European Union. To have shown that we can establish a free trade deal of the kind we have done with EFTA puts us in a very strong position to maintain and improve momentum in terms of doing a deeper trade deal with the European Union. That is a very high priority of this government.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1082414">As I look at our trade relationships, it is very important for members to recognize that we really have been on the sidelines for the better part of a decade in terms of our trade policies. We have become extremely dependent on the United States market because of NAFTA. That is all good, but for our trade it does mean that roughly 76% of our exports are going into the United States market. That is highly concentrated. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082415">There are protectionist pressures in the United States these days, so it is critically important that we not focus just on improving NAFTA, which is a focus for us, but that we also look at diversifying our trade relationships. Other countries are doing it and they are doing it aggressively. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082416">We can look at the United States. It has free trade agreements with 16 countries. Mexico has free trade agreements with 40 countries. Chile has trade agreements with 53 countries. Many of these countries are negotiating additional agreements as we speak.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082417">We can look at Canada. Before this agreement, we have had free trade agreements with five countries through four agreements covering five countries. That is not good enough for a trade dependent economy like Canada's, which is why Canada is actively negotiating free trade agreements with a number of countries. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082418">We have active trade negotiations going on with some 27 countries. When we broaden it to cover air bilaterals, investment agreements and free trade agreements, we are negotiating presently with something in the order of 100 countries.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082419">This government is committed to a re-energized trade policy. We are moving forward aggressively to ensure that Canada is back in the game and that Canadian producers and Canadian jobs are not disadvantaged because we are sitting on the sidelines.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082420">I would also note that on the same day we signed the EFTA agreement in Davos, Switzerland, we also concluded negotiations with Peru. That is another very significant trade agreement. It is a new generation trade agreement. When it comes before the House I will be able to explain to members some of the new and innovative elements in the agreement with Peru.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082421"> This agreement is what we call a first generation trade agreement because it was initiated roughly a decade or so ago, so it does not cover trade in services. It does not have an investment chapter, although it does have provision for those chapters to be added within the next three years.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082422">I should say that this deal is a good one for both agricultural and non-agricultural interests in Canada. It has certain sensitivities that have been inhibiting the closure of this agreement over the years. The shipbuilding industry was one particular area in which we have had some sensitivities. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082423">This agreement has the best provisions on shipbuilding of any free trade agreement that Canada has ever signed. The tariff phase-out is 15 years on the most sensitive products and 10 years on the next most sensitive products, and the first 3 years is a period during which there would be no tariff reductions at all. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082424">When we combine what is in this agreement with the buy Canada shipbuilding program that the Government of Canada is bringing along, with over $8 billion in shipbuilding, and when we combine that with the replenished structured financing facility for shipbuilding, I think we are on the threshold of a renaissance in the shipbuilding industry in Canada. I think it will be very good for the shipbuilding industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082425"> Even today as we speak, the Davie shipyard in Quebec, which has gone through serious financial problems over the last 10 years, is now owned by a Norwegian company and its order book goes out at least five years, with many of the vessels and work being done in that shipyard being sold back into the Norwegian and European markets.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1082426">I would also note on the agriculture front that this agreement does exclude the supply managed sectors. As members know, we have committed not to put those on the table in our free trade negotiations with other countries, and we have not done so in this case.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082427">Let me wrap up by saying that this is part of the government's approach to enhancing Canadian competitiveness and to recognizing that while we have had the strongest economy among the group of eight, certainly fiscally and economically, we do see risks on the horizon. Everyone knows there are some serious economic adjustments taking place in the United States and the rest of world. We are aggressively moving to ensure that Canada's economic performance in the long term is enhanced, because Canada's economic performance will be driven by our trade performance. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082428">There will be no way that we can spend our way to prosperity in Canada. It does not work that way. It leaks out in terms of just enhancing imports for Canada. We have to trade. We have to export. We have to sell to other countries. Our global commerce strategy, which is part of “Advantage Canada”, is designed to do just that.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082429">I would note that our approach is driven by the modern integrated approach to international trade which recognizes that trade today is driven by global value chains. Global value chains are driven by investment. Global value chains are driven by technology. Global value chains are driven by the movement of capital and people around the globe.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082430">Rooting those value chains deeply into Canada is a critical part of our trade strategy, which is why our free trade agreements are important. It is important to expand our free trade agreements from goods to cover services and investment. It is important to bring air bilaterals into the mix, because if we do not have good air services between Canada and our trading partners, we cannot service and be efficient in terms of being part of global supply chains.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082431">We are also doing investment agreements. As I noted earlier, investment agreements are critical because investment carries with it technology and opportunity in terms of driving exports and imports.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082432"> We are looking at transportation and logistics in a way that integrates this, like no other country and like never before in Canada, with our trade policy. Our transportation and logistics gateways in the Atlantic, in the Pacific, through Churchill in the north, and north and south between Ontario and Quebec and the United States, are critical elements of trade policy. Without transportation and logistics at a globally competitive level, we simply will not be a competitive trader in the world economy today.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082433">This is part of a larger mosaic of policies that are fitting together in a comprehensive way to ensure that Canada, Canadians and our kids and grandkids have opportunities like those we have enjoyed in the past. I welcome the discussion on this agreement today.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Byrne (Humber—St. Barbe—Baie Verte)" id="2464877"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78910" Type="2">Hon. Gerry Byrne (Humber—St. Barbe—Baie Verte, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1082434">Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the minister on certain aspects of this agreement. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082435">However, I would like to ask him a question as well. Does this agreement with the four European continental countries involved explicitly provide a basis for those four countries that prevents them from banning seal products from their marketplace on the basis of perceptions of the animal cruelty aspects, which other European countries are currently providing? Does this agreement provide a rules-based approach that prevents those four countries from doing so? </ParaText><ParaText id="1082436">Would the minister, in consideration of any potentially expanded European free trade agreement with other European countries, put the marker down right now that Canada will not engage in any discussions with any other European country unless they agree immediately to put into a rules-based approach that the banning of Canadian seal products would be explicitly illegal?</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Emerson" id="2464882"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="79000" Type="96">Hon. David Emerson</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1082437">Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raises an important question for Canada. That is the number of initiatives that have been launched in Europe, in particular, where countries are attempting to ban seal product exports from their markets.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082438"> This agreement does not actually have to deal directly and explicitly with the banning of seal products because the World Trade Organization rules, in Canada's view, already prohibit that type of a ban. We are aggressively pursuing consultations and possibly will follow that up with trade actions to ensure those rules do prevent and prohibit these types of bans in the future. We have ongoing discussions with a range of countries around this very issue.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Crowder" id="2464886"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78928" Type="2">Ms. Jean Crowder (Nanaimo—Cowichan, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1082439">Mr. Speaker, the government has said that shipbuilding is of strategic importance to the sovereignty of this nation. We have people like George MacPherson from the Shipyard General Workers' Federation talking about the fact that currently the shipyard industry is only operating at about a third of its capacity and that over the next 15 years it will be worth about $9 billion in Canadian jobs. The Shipbuilding Association of Canada and Irving Shipbuilding have called for a carve-out. We know that in the United States, for example, under the Jones Act, the Americans did a carve-out and were able to protect the shipbuilding industry in the U.S. Given all that, why would this minister not consider putting on the table a carve-out for the Canadian shipbuilding industry?</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Emerson" id="2464888"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="79000" Type="96">Hon. David Emerson</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1082440">Mr. Speaker, I think I should correct the member. The United States actually does not carve shipbuilding out of its trade agreements. The United States has domestic policies that prohibit foreign-constructed vessels from plying between two U.S. ports. Canada does not have such a policy. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082441">I would reassert that this agreement has the longest tariff phase-out of any agreement in Canada's history, in terms of the shipbuilding industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082442">I would also note that the Canadian shipbuilding industry is poised for a major expansion that I believe is going to tax the capacity of Canada's shipyards. It is going to require the training of shipyard trades that will be employed in the future. The Canadian shipbuilding industry is becoming technologically sophisticated.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082443"> We have carved out the “buy Canada” privilege that we now are able to apply to ships that are purchased by the Government of Canada and its agencies. So, that is preserved. Also, when we look at the billions of dollars in ship procurement that Canada will be doing over the next few years, our shipyards are going to have all the work they can handle.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Bains" id="2464890"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78789" Type="2">Hon. Navdeep Bains (Mississauga—Brampton South, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1082444">Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to the minister's remarks. I have two specific questions for the minister.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082445">The first question is with respect to the free trade agreement itself. In his remarks he mentioned that it is simply a generation one agreement and deals strictly with goods. He alluded to the fact that in 2007 there was approximately $13 billion worth of two-way trade, in terms of goods. However, there is also tremendous opportunity in the investment regime, as well; approximately $24 billion worth of two-way investment between Canada and the EFTA countries.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082446">Would he speak to the fact that this deal does not specifically address that and what steps is the government taking to deal with that?</ParaText><ParaText id="1082447">The second question is with respect to the issue around shipbuilding. I think that is a very important issue that has been raised by the Liberal Party, in the Liberal caucuses; specifically, the Atlantic caucus, which is standing up for shipbuilders.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082448">The minister has been very clear about the concerns around that, as well, but the government has only proposed a $50 million renewal of Industry Canada's structured financing facilities. Does he feel that $50 million is sufficient to help the industry transition when the tariffs are reduced?</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Emerson" id="2464893"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="79000" Type="96">Hon. David Emerson</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1082449">Mr. Speaker, I would offer an update on the numbers on direct investment between Canada and the European Free Trade Association countries.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082450">The numbers for 2007 now show that investments are up at $28 billion, from $24 billion in 2006. So investment is a chapter that we intend to add, as well as a chapter on trade and services. The agreement makes provision for those to be added as chapters. It also stipulates that should be done within the next three years. So, we will be working with the EFTA countries to ensure that we put those chapters in place in a timely way.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082451">I have spoken to shipbuilding. I will say again that the Canadian shipbuilding industry is about to go through a renaissance. I think it is dinosaur thinking to build the future of an industry as potentially dynamic as shipbuilding on the kind of protectionism that we have applied in the past. It is an industry that has the capacity in certain kinds of vessels and certain technologies to be globally competitive. It is an industry that can have a long term future, not just a future that is propped by interim protectionism. It is an industry that has a future.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082452">The structured financing facility, as the member knows, is not in my bailiwick. That is the <Affiliation DbId="111555" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation>'s portfolio. However, I would say that we, as a government, will be assessing that on a go-forward basis, assessing whether it is sufficient to support the global competitiveness of the shipbuilding industry. Then we will see how it looks over the next couple of years.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Storseth" id="2464899"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78932" Type="2">Mr. Brian Storseth (Westlock—St. Paul, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1082453">Mr. Speaker, as usual I will have to leave the agriculture questions to this side of the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082454">As the minister knows, the agriculture industry has become increasingly reliant on trade with the United States. Our producers realize this and realize the need to look somewhere else, to be able to open markets in other places of the world. That is what they are reliant on our government doing.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082455">I would like the minister to ensure for us that the agriculture industry is going to be a net benefactor out of this. I would like the minister to perhaps take a bit of time to talk about some of the benefits in the free trade agreement for our producers.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Emerson" id="2464901"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="79000" Type="96">Hon. David Emerson</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1082456">Mr. Speaker, we have made some quite significant gains in terms of the opportunities for agriculture in this agreement. Certainly, on durum wheat we are going to see some real opportunities from this agreement. Moving into crude canola, it will see some significant gains as a result of this agreement as well. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082457">On the agri-food side, frozen french fries, beer and frozen blueberries will gain market advantage. There will be a wide range of tariff reductions on processed and frozen foods in all three markets and in other sectors as well. In the non-agricultural area there will be significant gains for a number of manufacturing producers in Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082458">This should give Canadian producers a real opportunity and more than that it gives them an opportunity to go into these markets and establish a supply chain between EFTA and Canada but also extend that supply chain into the European Union because the European Union does have a free trade agreement with the EFTA countries. It is a real opportunity for Canadian companies who are really serious about competing in the global marketplace to take a great leap forward.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="30">(1030)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Bains" id="2464904"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78789" Type="2">Hon. Navdeep Bains (Mississauga—Brampton South, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1082459">Mr. Speaker, I take great pride in the fact that I have an opportunity today to speak to this very important bill, Bill <Document DbId="3460693" Type="3">C-55</Document>, with respect to Canada-EFTA, now referred to as CEFTA, the Canada-European free trade association agreement.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082460">From the outset I want to indicate our party's position on this very important bill, which is that the Liberal Party supports this deal, but calls on the government to continue to monitor and consider the issues around shipbuilding and the shipbuilding industry because this is something that has been brought to our attention on numerous occasions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082461"> We look forward to working with stakeholders in the shipbuilding industry and with the government to make sure it addresses these concerns. I will allude to some of these concerns in my remarks as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082462">Before I begin, I want to take a step back and create a context for the reason why we are supporting the bill. It is very important for the members in the House to recognize that we are the party of free and fair trade. We are the party of Wilfrid Laurier. We are the party, since that time, that has expanded Canada's trade opportunities abroad. We recognize that we are a trading nation. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082463">It was during the Liberal Party's regime that we signed and even created side agreements that were very important, beginning with NAFTA in 1994, then, as the minister alluded to, Chile and Israel in 1996, then Costa Rica in 2002. All these agreements gave Canada additional opportunities and allowed us to succeed in the international community.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082464">Currently, under the leader of the Liberal Party, the leader of the official opposition, and understanding points of trade, we recently made an announcement. I just want to remind members about the importance of trade because as the minister alluded to, we need to look at opportunities and we need to ensure that we take advantage of the opportunities.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082465"> In my opinion I feel the government has done limited work. I understand the minister has done a lot of good work, but I think he is constrained by the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in that the Conservatives have done very little work when it comes to Asia, for example, and that is an area where there are tremendous opportunities.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082466">On February 20 the Liberals made an announcement to allocate $50 million for the creation of the South Asian foundation to really harness the growth potential in a booming Asian economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082467"> I mention this in the context that we need to look at trade from a macro level. We promote the Doha round discussions very much and we think trade is very important, but we also need to look at how we deal with an emerging Asia, how we deal with a united European Union, and how we position ourselves within North America for economic prosperity and for the opportunities that exist.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082468">In terms of this particular free trade agreement, I would also like to remind the House that it was under the Liberal government that this initiative was started, but we recognize there were some legitimate concerns around shipbuilding, and so we worked extensively with the shipbuilders to see if those issues could be addressed.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082469">This is a generation one agreement. It strictly deals with goods. It does not have provisions for investment or services, and those are areas where there have tremendous opportunity and potential. We need to work with that. That was the question I asked the minister earlier because I felt that it was very important and needed to be addressed.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082470">With respect to the trade agreement, people sometimes do not recognize our trade with EFTA and how important it is, but it is actually a very important trading partner. It is Canada's fifth largest merchandising export destination. It has two-way trade of approximately $13 billion. It is a tremendous opportunity for our businesses here in Canada to export into those markets. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082471">People sometimes underestimate their importance when we allude to some of the countries involved in this agreement: Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Iceland and Norway. People do not think of those as countries that we necessarily trade with, but we do a lot of trade, However,t more importantly, there is a lot of investment and two-way investment between those countries. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082472">I have 2006 data with me. Investment has increased, but we actually invest around $8.4 billion into those countries and they in turn invest $15.6 billion in Canada. There is tremendous opportunity there with respect to trade. Those trade statistics allude to the importance of our trading relationship and this will enhance that relationship. However, there is a tremendous potential that exists in the service sector and the investment regime as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082473">The other area that was mentioned that I thought was very important to discuss, and the member opposite mentioned it as well, is with regard to agriculture and agricultural products. This is an important issue that was raised during a committee discussion as well. When the free trade agreement was initiated and eventually signed, there were legitimate concerns around supply management.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1082474">We support this free trade agreement because it maintains the Canadian supply management program. That is very important to us. As a Liberal Party, we have been staunch defenders of this initiative and we feel supply management is very important for our domestic market.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082475">Therefore, because of the provisions in the agreement and the fact that Canadian supply management programs are maintained, the agricultural issues by and large are addressed. This was our primary concern with respect to agriculture. We understand the importance of agriculture. We raised this issue and ensured this issue was dealt with in the appropriate fashion in the agreement.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082476">I alluded earlier in my remarks to non-agricultural goods. I said we supported this deal but we had concerns specifically around shipbuilding and the shipbuilding industry. We are supportive of the deal because it legitimately address some of those concerns, for example, the fact that for the first three years there is no tariff reduction, which is very important for shipbuilders. Once the deal is signed, hopefully effective January 1, 2009, if all goes well, it will ultimately mean that by 2012 there will be no tariff reductions for shipbuilders.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082477">Subsequent to that, there will be a 15 year phase-out on Canada's most sensitive vessels. Those sensitive vessels range from ferries to cruise ships to offshore supply ships to basically salvage ships. Those vessels will have a 15 year phase-out. The other vessels such as tankers, those having to do with drilling platforms, drill ships, ice breakers are given a 10 year phase-out period. Those are sufficient safeguards to allow for the reduction of shipbuilding tariffs and allow the Canadian industry the opportunity to rebuild itself in some context, to redefine itself and ensure that it can compete not only domestically, but abroad as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082478">The other issue we felt was important was whether the requirements for buy in Canada procurement policy would remain intact, which was important to us. When we saw the deal, this had been maintained and honoured in the free trade agreement. There was no requirement to modify the buy in Canada procurement policy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082479">Therefore, not only do we have a long tariff reduction phase, but we have a buy in Canada procurement policy that is maintained and protected.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082480">The other concern we had was with respect to the dispute mechanism and how we would deal with any disputes if they were to occur. We again have very little confidence in the government. If we take, for example, the softwood lumber agreement, or as some refer to it, the softwood sellout, that very much questions the government's judgment and the way it represents Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082481">I remind the viewers and the members in the House, that agreement cost $1 billion of Canadian taxpayer money. It left $1 billion on the table. It created a quota system in Canada. It in effect forced companies in Canada, the softwood lumber industry, to be subjected to quotas. Now we are going to the courts again with the U.S. government on these issues again. We are being sued on these matters, or being taken to court in litigation over this.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082482">More important, the fundamental issue we had with that was we lost our sovereignty. We lost the ability to genuinely be able to create programs in Canada to work with industry, and that concerned us.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082483">Therefore, we want to ensure the dispute mechanism does not reinvent the problems we incurred with the softwood lumber agreement. The dispute mechanism in this agreement addresses some legitimate concerns around snap-back provisions, about the fact that it will establish a joint committee to supervise the implementation of CEFTA. Disputes will be resolved through cooperation and consultation and any matter not settled in 90 days may be referred to a tribunal to interpret the agreement and determine consistency with obligations. These important provisions have been addressed in the agreement.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1082484">We support the bill. We support the free trade agreement. As I said before, we are the party of free and fair trade. Liberals understand the importance of trade and of creating opportunities for our businesses. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082485">I want to share one small example with the House. I come from the riding of Mississauga—Brampton South, which is situated close to the airport. Many logistical companies, owners of small business and others rely on trade and look for opportunities to expand trade. It is unfortunate that the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> is attacking Ontario. He has said not to invest in Ontario. I hope the <Affiliation DbId="78741" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation> will not follow suit and will use his better judgment.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082486">The reason I bring that up is because Canada's trade surplus has been in decline since the Conservatives took power. Our trade surplus is shrinking each month and our export market opportunities are fairly limited. The government needs to continuously examine foreign markets to look for opportunities for our businesses, specifically small and medium sized enterprises, like the ones in my riding, that depend on trade, and create a lot of jobs and economic opportunity.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082487">This is a first generation trade agreement. It is a step in the right direction. It addresses some legitimate concerns around agriculture, supply management, and the shipbuilding industry, but we still have some concerns. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082488">I asked a question earlier today with respect to the structured financing facility. The shipbuilding industry is supported through Industry Canada by a $50 million renewal. This is not sufficient. The government needs to do more. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082489">The <Affiliation DbId="78741" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation>, in his previous job as a minister in the Liberal government, was also the minister responsible for Industry Canada. He looked at this issue. I asked my question in that capacity. I wanted him to explain to the House what more was being done to help this industry in terms of financing. The minister is very optimistic about shipbuilding. He feels it is a dynamic industry with a lot of potential. I want to ensure that the minister understands we share those same concerns. There is tremendous opportunity as well in that industry. Perhaps the minister could speak to that issue and explain what more is being done to help it out.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082490">I look forward to any questions or concerns by members opposite.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Dewar" id="2464915"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78922" Type="2">Mr. Paul Dewar (Ottawa Centre, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1082491">Mr. Speaker, the member made a number of points about the government's policy on trade in general, but specifically on the proposed trade deal.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082492">Our party has raised concerns about our shipbuilding industry, and my colleague from B.C. raised it earlier. This is not a concern for only Atlantic Canada; it is also a concern for B.C. as well. There is the potential for jobs for manufacturers right across the country in supplying parts, et cetera. In the case of B.C., we have called on the provincial government to do more. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082493">The member talked about procurement policy.

We are frustrated because we do not see that happening. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082494">I listened carefully to the minister and to the member about the tariff phase-out. Most Canadians want to see a healthy shipbuilding industry, one that is supported by provincial governments. They want to see our Canada first policy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082495">Before we enter into a deal like this, should we not have a healthy, robust shipbuilding industry? Norway has done that. If we enter into a trade deal like this, it will have all the advantages and we will have all the disadvantages. As was mentioned by my colleague, we are not at full capacity. We are not buying Canada first. We need to have a healthy shipbuilding industry. Should we not focus on our shipbuilding in Canada first before we enter into a trade deal like this, particularly in light of Norway?</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="45">(1045)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Bains" id="2464917"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78789" Type="2">Hon.

That point was raised in committee on numerous occasions. We received clarification time and time again that Norway no longer had a program or a regime that provided subsidies. The concern with Norway is a legitimate concern, but it was been addressed in committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082498">At the beginning of my comments, I said that we supported the agreement, but we had legitimate concerns about the need to ensure the meeting Canada's procurement policy was kept intact, which I believe it is. That is my understanding and that is what the minister and the government have said. I also said that I wanted further clarification on structured financing.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082499">We need to pursue free trade agreements, especially with some of the challenges we face, such as the Doha development agenda. We need to create more export opportunities. With the strong Canadian dollar and the tightening of the border, we need to look at diversifying our markets. There is potential opportunity here, recognizing the concerns he has referred to with the shipbuilding. If the government could provide further clarification on a structured financing for the industry, that would definitely help the industry put itself in a competitive position going forward.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Dhaliwal" id="2464919"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78872" Type="2">Mr. Sukh Dhaliwal (Newton—North Delta, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1082500">Mr. Speaker, I would also like to echo the comments made by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78789" Type="2">Mississauga—Brampton South</Affiliation> about the minister.

It is very important for us to create strong economic opportunities. I hope the government takes those comments very seriously and understands the importance of building strong relationships with Asia.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082505">Specifically, the questions he mentioned with regard to shipbuilding and the tariff reduction regime, I alluded to them in my remarks. I will highlight which ones are subject to a 15 year tariff reduction and which ships and vessels are subject to a 10 year tariff reduction. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082506">Ferries and cruise ships are subject to a 15 year tariff reduction. Again, I want to preface this comment by saying that made in Canada procurement policies are protected and exempt in this agreement as well. Dredgers and salvage ships are subject to a 15 year tariff reduction. With respect to 10 year tariff reductions, this includes tankers, fishing vessels, drilling platforms, drill ships, production platforms and icebreakers.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082507"> Those are categories, If there is anything specific that the member has with regard to any particular vessel, we can always look it up to ensure it is part of the regime.

I want to address shipbuilding, coming from British Columbia. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082509">In the early 1980s our shipbuilding industry was very healthy. What has happened over many years of government neglect, which we can lay both at the Conservative and Liberal doors, is the shipbuilding industry has gone into crisis. We have seen shipyard after shipyard close.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082510">The member pointed out, quite rightly, that Norway's shipbuilding industry currently is not subsidized, but it had a long period of government investment and subsidy to get it to the place where it was healthy enough to be able to stand alone.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082511">Why would the member not support the shipbuilding industry's own request to have a carve out provision for the shipbuilding industry and then to have an effective government policy to actually support shipbuilding, particularly in view of the fact that it is of strategic national importance? Why would he not support a carve out?</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Bains" id="2464929"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78789" Type="2">Hon. Navdeep Bains</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1082512">Mr. Speaker, when we pursue free trade agreements, it is a two way negotiation process, a give and take. The fact that there are long tariff reductions, a made in Canada procurement policy, that supply management is protected and that for the first three years there is no tariff reduction, all these very much play into our national interests, and they were addressed in the free trade agreement.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082513"> I share the member's concern with respect to shipbuilding. The government has done very little to develop a comprehensive plan to deal with our domestic shipbuilding industry and to create a long term strategic initiative and partnership with the shipbuilding industry so it will be able to compete. Norway is a very good example because it did subsidize. There is no doubt that it no longer provides subsidies now but it did subsidized before, which allowed its shipbuilding industry to be in a competitive position.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082514">The onus and responsibility now lies with the current government to put together a plan for not only structured financing but a more comprehensive plan that can position our industry, once the tariffs are reduced, especially when the tariff reduction starts in 2012, to be on an equal and competitive footing. Even though the subsidies no longer exist today in Norway, there is no doubt that the subsidies in the past have put it in a more favourable position. Therefore, I do very much recognize the member's concerns. </ParaText></Content></Intervention><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Crête" id="2464931"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78700" Type="2">Mr. Paul Crête (Montmagny—L'Islet—Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1082515">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the proposed free trade agreement with Switzerland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland, the members of the European Free Trade Association. I am speaking on behalf of all the Bloc members and would like to acknowledge in particular the contributions of the members for <Affiliation DbId="78644" Type="2">Sherbrooke</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="78662" Type="2">Berthier—Maskinongé</Affiliation> to the Standing Committee on International Trade, which has studied the proposed agreement and the free trade agreement.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082516">The Bloc believes that this is a good free trade agreement that deserves to be supported. Moreover, we believe that Quebec will benefit a great deal from this agreement.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082517">For example, the pharmaceutical industry in Quebec, like the industry in Switzerland, is very healthy. We can therefore expedite trade and perhaps pave the way for more and more transactions. To penetrate the American market, Swiss pharmaceutical companies might be tempted to produce drugs here, which presents an attractive opportunity for us.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082518">We would remind this House that Quebec is the home of the brand name drug industry in Canada because of its pool of skilled researchers and its tax breaks. For Quebec this agreement will pave the way for new business opportunities.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082519">The agreement facilitates trade between a company and its subsidiaries and is likely to mean new investments in the pharmaceutical industry in Quebec. That is good news.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082520">Let us turn our attention now to Norway. Nickel accounts for over 80% of our exports to that country. The largest mine in Canada and the third largest in the world is owned by the Swiss company Xstrata and is located in Ungava. This agreement may also have benefits on that front.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082521">Let us continue our tour of the countries with a stop in Iceland. Aluminum is our main export to Iceland. Aluminum production is also concentrated in Quebec.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082522">Overall, this is an attractive agreement. I would also say it does not have the same drawbacks as previous agreements.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082523">For example, NAFTA and the agreements with Costa Rica and Chile all contain what could be called bad clauses on investments that give companies the right to sue a government that adopts measures that would reduce their profits. This sort of provision is not found in the agreement with the EFTA. Consequently, the free trade agreement with Europe, at least this part of Europe, is worthwhile. There will be no sword of Damocles hanging over our heads, because this agreement does not contain any such clauses.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082524">Furthermore, the agreement only covers goods and not services. It will not create competition with public services, whether they are offered by the state or not, since they will not be covered. Similarly, banks providing financial services will not be in competition with Switzerland, which is known to have a very solid and very discreet banking system, and Liechtenstein, which is a true haven for the financial world when it comes to taxation and anonymity. We are already having enough problems with Barbados without adding any more. It would be best if the agreement did not allow this type of exchange. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082525">For government procurement it is the same thing. The government is still free to favour domestic procurement, subject to the WTO agreement on government contracts. It would be somewhat ridiculous for the government to negotiate room to manoeuvre and then decide not to use it. It is imperative that the federal government, which is the largest purchaser of goods and services in Canada, favour suppliers here and consider the potential spinoffs from its purchases.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082526">We have another absolutely ridiculous example. Canadian athletes will be dressed in material that is made in China. There should have been a different solution. We could call this an obvious and quite unacceptable lack of pride. This is outside the limits of the agreement before us, but I wanted to mention it anyway. When we look at an agreement like this, we have to look at what it will allow us to do. This agreement does not allow for such an absurd possibility.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082527">The whole issue of agriculture is a concern that a number of MPs have mentioned in this House. Supply management is not affected by this agreement. The Bloc Québécois motion passed here in 2005 has become the cornerstone of the Canadian government's position on protecting supply management. We are very proud of that and we hope things will continue this way.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082528">We are just as proud of the fact that the supply management model is being developed throughout the southern countries. It may be part of the solution to the food crisis. The more countries that use this type of system, the less agriculture will be subjected to traditional trade patterns. Thus, it will be possible to provide better protection that will allow both communities and producers to be well served in terms of agricultural production.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="55">(1055)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1082529">This agreement ensures that supply management will not be affected. That is another reason that the Bloc Québécois likes this agreement. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082530">This agreement will make it possible to implement bilateral agricultural agreements as add-ons to the free trade agreement. We will see how this will come together. Bilateral agreements will not necessarily have a huge impact on Quebec agriculture, because milk proteins are excluded from the agreement and the tariff quotas and over-quota tariffs remain unchanged. In short, supply managed products will be protected.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082531">However, there is one sector where this agreement would be good, although the federal government will really have to go out of its way to make a sustained effort. I am talking about the issue of support for shipyards. A number of members in this House have brought this up this morning. As a member of the maritime caucus, I know that there have been questions. They have been handled in an acceptable fashion in the agreement, but that does not mean that the Canadian government will not have to have a more aggressive and constructive policy on shipyards. In fact, we have some concerns.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082532">For example, imported vessels are currently subject to a 25% tariff. Under the agreement, these tariffs will gradually decrease over three years, and will be completely eliminated in 15 years. In the future, in 15 or 20 years, we do not want to see a whole industrial sector disappear, as was the case with the textile sector. We know that the government needs to take action now to ensure that once this all disappears, our industries in this sector will be competitive.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082533">Our shipyards are currently less modern than Norwegian shipyards, for example. They are in worse condition. So some things will need to be renewed, since Norway has invested heavily in modernizing its shipyards, while ours have been completely abandoned by the government. </ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="No" ToCText="The Deputy Speaker" id="2464933"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="81492" Type="22">The Deputy Speaker</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1082534">Order, please.

The committee had more time to complete its work than it used, but it chose not to do so. It chose to do so, on division.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082788">Procedural considerations that should be taken into account are the following. The note to Standing Order 76.1(5) states that the purpose of report stage is:</ParaText><ParaText id="1082789"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">—to provide Members who were not members of the committee, with an opportunity to have the House consider specific amendments they wish to propose. It is not meant to be a reconsideration of the committee stage of a bill. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1082790">The committee decided to end its clause by clause examination of the bill prematurely. One of the persons involved in that decision was the member who is now proposing further amendments. The new Democratic Party is putting forward amendments at report stage therefore that ought to have been considered in committee. Thus, the course of action being proposed to you, Mr. Speaker, by the New Democratic Party is inconsistent with the purpose of report stage.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082791">In this vein I would note that the amendments on the notice paper stand in the name of the member for <Affiliation DbId="79026" Type="2">Skeena—Bulkley Valley</Affiliation>, who is a member of the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development, where the bill was considered. He therefore had ample opportunity to introduce the amendments at that time.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082792">Mr. Speaker, I apologize for the fact that I sound like I am doing a bad imitation of Brian Mulroney, but I have a cold. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082793">Furthermore, the Standing Orders state, at page 270:</ParaText><ParaText id="1082794"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Motions which were considered in committee and subsequently withdrawn are also generally not selected.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1082795">I would note that the amendments that appear on the notice paper are the same amendments the member for <Affiliation DbId="79026" Type="2">Skeena—Bulkley Valley</Affiliation> had given notice of during the committee's clause by clause examination of the bill. These amendments therefore were effectively withdrawn when the committee decided to report the bill back to the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082796">In his point of order, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78397" Type="2">Windsor—Tecumseh</Affiliation> took note of the lengthy debate on the bill during the committee's clause by clause consideration of the bill and stated that this was the committee's rationale for ending its work prematurely.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082797">I would concede that this point might have been relevant if the debate in committee had prevented the committee from reporting the bill before the May 7 deadline, at which time, in accordance with the Standing Orders, the bill would have been deemed reported without amendments, thereby depriving the member of the ability to present those amendments in committee. However, this was not the case as the committee decided, with the support of the relevant member, to end its study of the bill three weeks before it was obliged to report the bill to the House.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="05">(1205)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1082798">We turn now to some precedents.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082799">To support his argument, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78397" Type="2">Windsor—Tecumseh</Affiliation> raised two previous rulings where the Speaker selected report stage amendments that could have been moved in committee. However, the circumstances in each case were clearly different from the case before us today.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082800">In the first case, the January 28, 2003 ruling, Mr. Speaker, you selected report stage amendments from the member for <Affiliation DbId="78477" Type="2">Mississauga South</Affiliation> on the grounds that the member was not a member of the standing committee and therefore could not propose amendments in committee. This is clearly not the case with the report stage amendments to Bill <Document DbId="3073285" Type="4">C-377</Document>, as the member for <Affiliation DbId="79026" Type="2">Skeena—Bulkley Valley</Affiliation> is a member of the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082801">The second example. In a ruling on November 6, 2001, Mr. Speaker, you selected report stage amendments from the member for <Affiliation DbId="78397" Type="2">Windsor—Tecumseh</Affiliation> on the grounds that the member sat on two committees that were seized with bills at the same time and therefore it was not possible for the member to be present at the relevant committee at the time when such amendments would have, in the normal course of events, been introduced. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082802">This precedent does not apply to the present case since the committee's minutes of proceeding show that the member for <Affiliation DbId="79026" Type="2">Skeena—Bulkley Valley</Affiliation> was clearly an active participant in the committee's clause by clause study of Bill <Document DbId="3073285" Type="4">C-377</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082803">In short, unlike the precedents cited by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78397" Type="2">Windsor—Tecumseh</Affiliation>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="79026" Type="2">Skeena—Bulkley Valley</Affiliation> would have been able to move his amendments if the committee had chosen to continue clause by clause consideration. Instead, the committee decided to stop its work and report the bill back to the House, thereby precluding the introduction of the said amendments.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082804">I submit to you, Mr. Speaker, that this is a blatant abuse of the rules of the House. This is clearly an example of the majority on a committee effectively suspending or bypassing the Standing Orders in order to abrogate the protection that these Standing Orders provide to the rights of the minority.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082805">By using such tactics, the opposition majority on any committee could theoretically rush through any bill by deciding to report the bill without any study and then proposing report stage amendments to amend the bill. This would be a dangerous precedent to set for private member's bills as such items are already subject to a significant time allocation and are already fast tracked relative to government bills.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082806">Mr. Speaker, to conclude, I would like to draw your attention to your statement of March 21, 2001, on the guidelines for the selection of report stage amendments:</ParaText><ParaText id="1082807"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">—motions in amendment that could have been presented in committee will not be selected....Accordingly, I would strongly urge all members and all parties to avail themselves fully of the opportunity to propose amendments during committee stage so that the report stage can return to the purpose for which it was created...</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1082808">I have emphasized that quote because it is so important.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082809">Clearly the New Democratic Party has chosen to ignore the Speaker's wise advice by not availing itself fully of the opportunity to propose amendments during committee stage. NDP members cannot have it both ways. They cannot decide that clause by clause consideration should be terminated prematurely and then expect people to propose its committee amendments at report stage. The NDP is essentially asking that the committee stage of Bill <Document DbId="3073285" Type="4">C-377</Document> be continued at report stage, and this is exactly the opposite of what is stated in the Standing Orders and what has been confirmed by the Speaker. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082810">I therefore submit to the House that the amendments to Bill <Document DbId="3073285" Type="4">C-377</Document> should not be selected for debate at report stage.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Crête" id="2465284"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78700" Type="2">Mr. Paul Crête (Montmagny—L'Islet—Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1082840">Mr. Speaker, I want to reiterate that the debate concerns the proposed free trade agreement between Canada and the European Free Trade Association, which is made up of Switzerland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland. The Bloc Québécois is in favour of this bill and the agreement.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082841">In the first part of my speech, I talked about how the agreement could mean attractive opportunities for the pharmaceutical industry in Quebec. The same is true of the nickel sector, especially for one mine in Ungava, in Quebec. The agreement could also benefit aluminum exports to Iceland. Consequently, Quebec is very interested in seeing this agreement implemented.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082842">Moreover, we have ascertained that the agreement will have no impact on agricultural supply management. The existing systems in Quebec and Canada can be maintained.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082843">However, at the end of my speech, just before question period, I made the point that the federal government will have to take far more aggressive steps to support the shipbuilding industry once this free trade agreement takes effect. The agreement provides that tariffs will decrease over 15 years.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082844">I believe that the shipbuilding industry in Norway, in particular, is much better equipped today than Canada's. Canada has abandoned the shipyards. The industry was not really given the tools to grow.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082845">In that context, I would like to point out that one recommendation in the report presented by the Standing Committee on International Trade was adopted by that committee. It had been proposed by the hon. members for <Affiliation DbId="78644" Type="2">Sherbrooke</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="78662" Type="2">Berthier—Maskinongé</Affiliation> from the Bloc Québécois, our two spokespeople in this matter. They did their work in a very conscientious manner and got support from the committee on the following motion:</ParaText><ParaText id="1082846"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> The Canadian government must without delay implement an aggressive Maritime policy to support the industry, while ensuring that any such strategy is in conformity with Canada’s commitments at the WTO.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1082847">The purpose of the motion is to raise a red flag. Indeed, the free trade agreement is desirable. However, in practice, for the marine industry the government truly has to make a significant shift and implement a support strategy for the shipbuilding industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082848">This currently does not exist and our shipyards have often been left to fend for themselves over the past few years. We are seeing the results of that. It is possible to have a healthy and competitive shipbuilding industry, but we have to have a policy to that effect. That is no reason not to support the free trade agreement with European countries.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082849">We are sending a message to all of Europe. The agreement I am currently referring to is the agreement between Canada and the European Free Trade Association, which includes Switzerland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland. It is important to note that these are countries Quebec does a lot of trade with. However, this now suggests that the real target should be signing a free trade agreement with the European Union that will help achieve results for all our exchanges with Europe.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082850">For example, the four countries involved in the current agreement represent 12 million people and roughly 1% of Canadian exports. With the European Union, it would be 495 million inhabitants who generate 31% of global GDP. In fact, the European Union is currently the strongest economic power in the world.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082851">Every day we are painfully becoming more aware that our economy is far too dependent on that of the United States. When there is a downturn in consumerism such as we are seeing now in the United States, when we see that the Americans are committing a lot of money to the war in Iraq, when we see the commercial paper crisis, when we see the economic slowdown in the United States, when we see the obvious aggression of emerging countries such as India and China, we can see that it is getting more and more difficult to keep our place in the American market.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082852">This agreement gives us an opportunity to move forward and guarantee that we have access to Europe.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1082853">The current free trade agreement indicates that we are moving in the right direction. We should have a similar agreement for the entire European Union, but we do not. We believe that the federal government should speed up its attempts to access Europe so that we can arrive at an even more significant agreement that will give the best possible results.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082854">This is the reality. We have lost 150,000 manufacturing jobs in five years, more than 80,00 of which were lost since the Conservatives came to power. They follow the laissez-faire doctrine, meaning that the market regulates everything, but that does not mean that we should not be open to new markets, as we would be with the free trade agreement we are talking about today, and of course a more widespread agreement with the whole of Europe. The European Union is absolutely essential to diversifying our markets and reducing our dependency on the United States. The fact that Canada has not yet signed a free trade agreement with the European Union considerably diminishes the competitiveness of our businesses on the European market.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082855">At this point in my speech, I would like to say that the Canadian government must realize that it is essential to move forward on environmental issues. Other countries must see that we are respecting Kyoto, and that we will be firmly committed to Kyoto plus, which will be developed at the Copenhagen conference next year. As it stands, we could end up paying export taxes because the international community does not recognize that we have made an adequate effort on environmental issues. The government will have to be tougher and much more active in this respect, and it will have to recognize that sustainable development is not only good for the environment, but it is also good for the economy. Canada is not currently a leader, as it could have been if it had truly decided to accept Kyoto, to implement it and to create resources more quickly, such as a carbon exchange, so that we could reap all the necessary benefits.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082856">Let us go back to the possibility of a free trade agreement with Europe. With the rise of the petrodollar, European companies have tended to open subsidiaries in the United States and leave out Canada. That is another reason why it would be a good idea to sign a free trade agreement with all of Europe.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082857">Canada's share of direct European investments in North America dropped from 3% in 1992 to 1% in 2004. The alarm bells are ringing. We need to change our attitude, we need to change the way we do things, and we need to come to an agreement with all of Europe, like the one we are debating today, as quickly as possible. It would be to Quebec's and Canada's advantage to sign and implement an agreement as soon as possible.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082858">I should also point out that the European Union and Mexico have had a free trade agreement in place since 2000. As such, if a Canadian company is doing business in Mexico, it is in that company's best interest to relocate more of its production to Mexico because it can access both the European and U.S. markets, which it cannot do if it keeps its production in Quebec. It is important to both companies and workers for the federal government to change its attitude and speed things up in terms of opening up markets. Being open to globalization when the conditions are right means that our companies have to be in a competitive position. We have to give them the fiscal tools they need, and we have to give them the tools they need to access the market.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082859">The example I just gave is the best one. A Quebec company does not have the same access to the European market as a Mexican company, and companies in Mexico have access to both North American and European markets. This is an aberration that should be rectified as soon as possible.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082860">Quebec would be the first to benefit from a free trade agreement with Europe. The Bloc Québécois has been promoting this for some time now. We proposed it as part of our election platform and our political agenda. We believe that if we persevere in this file as we have in others, we will eventually get a free trade agreement with Europe.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082861">For example, 70% of the people who work for French companies in Canada are from Quebec, as are 37% of those who work for U.K. companies here and 35% of those who work for German companies here. In contrast, just 20% of people working for U.S. companies in Canada are Quebeckers. The Government of Quebec has been working with companies since the Quiet Revolution, and that is a major advantage when it comes time to seek out European investment. We have everything we need to become the bridgehead for European investment in America.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1082862">Thus, we see what the prevailing spirit was when the free trade agreement was signed with the United States, the agreement that later became NAFTA. Thanks to that spirit, Quebeckers rallied behind their leaders who wanted to implement free trade. Quebec has benefited from this free trade. Unfortunately, market conditions have changed considerably. Since the markets have opened up to China and other countries around the world, we are now facing a new reality. This reality calls for new tools for international trade. Free trade agreements are the best example.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082863">Today, the Bloc Québécois is very pleased to support Bill <Document DbId="3460693" Type="3">C-55</Document>, which would implement the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the EFTA, that is, the European Free Trade Association, consisting of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082864">We believe this is a step towards adopting such an agreement with Europe as a whole. Quebec is open to this position and hopes to see it come to fruition. Quebec as a whole shares this desire to move forward on such agreements. We hope the federal government will pick up the pace and conclude an agreement with the European Union. That would be the best way to diversify our economy, which really needs a boost, due to the slowdown in the American economy and the emergence of new competition from China.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082865">I am pleased to confirm once again that the Bloc Québécois supports this free trade agreement and hopes to see it implemented as soon as possible. It will be beneficial for businesses and workers in Quebec.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Galipeau" id="2465298"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="114224" Type="92">The Acting Speaker (Mr. Royal Galipeau)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1082866">Before I go to questions and comments, I would like to thank the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="120543" Type="2">Vancouver Quadra</Affiliation> for maintaining order and decorum in the House over the last several minutes.

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. McDonough" id="2465299"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78793" Type="2">Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1082868">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased this afternoon to have an opportunity to speak to Bill <Document DbId="3460693" Type="3">C-55</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082869"> I was in the House earlier today when the <Affiliation DbId="79000" Type="96">minister of trade</Affiliation> made his very enthusiastic uncritical comments in support of the bill that is before us. I listened very carefully to what the <Affiliation DbId="79000" Type="96">minister of trade</Affiliation> had to say about what the impact of Bill <Document DbId="3460693" Type="3">C-55</Document> if implemented in its current form would be on the shipbuilding industry of this country.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082870"> I expected that he would speak in an informed way about what are some very serious concerns which are widely shared not just by a small corner of this House, not just by 30 New Democrat members of Parliament, but by a great many people across this country, particularly on both coasts, in terms of the very worrisome impact this free trade deal will have on the shipbuilding industry. Far from hearing him give appropriate attention to the very legitimate concerns that are widely shared and widely expressed, he more or less dismissed those concerns. I do not want to misrepresent him in any way, but I think he referred to them as certain sensitivities. He said there were certain sensitivities that had arisen in regard to shipbuilding.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082871">I do not know the <Affiliation DbId="79000" Type="96">minister of trade</Affiliation> personally, but I have to say that is one of the world's greatest understatements. Perhaps he is prone to understatement, I do not know, but it certainly does not do justice and it does not deal fairly with what are very deeply rooted concerns. From my point of view and that of the New Democratic caucus, these are well-founded concerns about what the impact of this deal, if it goes ahead unamended, will be on thousands of jobs in this country.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082872">Having said that, there is a very unhappy history, one that is very much shared by and is the joint responsibility of a succession of Conservative, Liberal and Conservative governments. There has been a complete failure by any of those governments over the decades to put in place the kind of comprehensive, coherent, national shipbuilding policy that would have served this country so much better than the kind of fits and starts, piecemeal approach to shipbuilding. It has often been an approach that has been based more on short term electoral considerations than on the very fundamental issues that underlie the need for a comprehensive national shipbuilding policy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082873">My own experience and exposure to the inadequate responses of the succession of governments began when I was leader of the New Democratic Party in Nova Scotia. There were very real, well-founded concerns about the impact of that lack of a national shipbuilding policy in my own riding in Halifax. At that time I was proud to represent the riding of Halifax Fairview, and before that, Halifax Chebucto. Both of those provincial ridings were very much impacted by the policy, or more accurately, the absence of a national shipbuilding policy. That had an impact on the Halifax shipyards. We have systematically allowed that to happen in this country. Other countries, and one most notable in the context of this debate is Norway, have understood that there cannot be a sound, competitive shipbuilding industry if there is not a net comprehensive national policy.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1082874">I recall attending federal NDP conventions in the early 1990s. I think 1991 was one of the occasions when I was part of crafting and piloting through a very comprehensive policy that was adopted by the New Democratic Party. We called for that national shipbuilding policy. Before I ever came to Ottawa and continuing since I entered this chamber in 1997, the New Democratic Party has been very consistent and very persistent in continuing to press for that national shipbuilding policy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082875">We still do not have it. When the <Affiliation DbId="78741" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation> refers to “certain sensitivities”, his words, with respect to the disastrous impact that this trade deal, unamended, could have on our shipbuilding industry, he is being extremely insensitive to both that pathetic history of governments of his party's stripe and of the Liberals in not securing a sound base for a robust shipbuilding industry that can continue to compete in today's world.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082876">There is absolutely nothing wrong with our current shipbuilders and our current shipyard workers in terms of their ability to compete, but we have had such a fits and starts approach to this industry that what has effectively happened is that Norway foremost, but other countries as well, has invested in a smart, orderly and far-sighted way in its shipbuilding industry. It has in the process established itself as a competitor that will be a huge winner from the trade deal that is before us. I say good for it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082877">Some people ask, what is wrong with New Democrats? After all Norway has had a proud tradition of being a social democratic country committed to high wages, committed to practically the whole range of policy objectives that the current government and the Liberal government before it completely pushed aside as not the domain of government intervention. In fact in Norway the government has intervened in a very smart way to build up its shipbuilding capacity, to train, to invest in the hardware, software and infrastructure needed, in the tax policies and so on.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082878">It is not some kind of unexpected development that Canada finds itself at such a disadvantage in relation to competing with a country like Norway. What is unexpected, but I suppose we should come to expect it, what is absolutely unacceptable and impossible to understand for a lot of people whose jobs are at stake is what on earth Canada has been doing in the meantime that has allowed us to be so vulnerable.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082879">It is not just New Democrats who are speaking out on this, although before I go to some of the other voices and some of the other interests very much concerned about the devastation in the shipbuilding industry that can result from this trade deal, I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78886" Type="2">Sackville—Eastern Shore</Affiliation>, who is not able to be here today. I have to say that if he had been in the House to hear the minister talk about certain sensitivities, I think he probably would have had a heart attack. In fact, he had an accident and because of his injury was in hospital yesterday being operated on, and therefore, he was not able to be here today. He has never failed to take a stand on behalf of the shipbuilders and the shipyard workers in this country from the day he entered public life.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082880">It is not just the Nova Scotian members of Parliament in the New Democratic caucus who have been very vocal, knowledgeable and persistent in putting forward their concerns. There are several members from British Columbia. For example, there is the member for <Affiliation DbId="78928" Type="2">Nanaimo—Cowichan</Affiliation>. The Nanaimo shipyards are very important to the local economy and obviously for local jobs. There is the member for <Affiliation DbId="78359" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation>. In Victoria the Esquimalt dry dock is very important. The Lower Mainland and the Vancouver members all have expressed their concerns articulately. However, it is not just New Democrats who have spoken out. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1082881">I would like to read briefly from some of the testimony before the parliamentary committee when Karl Risser, president of Local 1, which was originally the Marine Workers' Federation but is now affiliated with the Canadian Auto Workers Shipbuilding, appeared before the committee. He did so not just on behalf of the proud members who have a long history with the Marine Workers' Federation and today are affiliated with CAW, but also on behalf of the Shipbuilding, Waterways and Marine Workers Council that has done a lot of collaboration and coordination around its concerns about this impending devastation to the shipbuilding industry. He stated in committee:</ParaText><ParaText id="1082882"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> I am here on behalf of the workers in the marine sector...to express our opposition to this agreement. Canadian shipbuilders find themselves competing for work in domestic and international markets on far from a level ground. Other governments, Norway for one, have supported the shipbuilding industries for years and have built them into powers, while Canada has not. We have had little protection, and what little protection we have left is a 25% tariff on imported vessels into Canada, which is being washed away by government daily through agreements such as this and the exemptions being negotiated with companies.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1082883">I will not go on at length, but he makes the important point that ministers of defence over the years have acknowledged how important shipbuilding is to our defence. I know there are some members who will rush forward in this context and ask what my concern is now because we have some important new shipbuilding activity happening with respect to the submarine refits and to the frigates. That is absolutely true and it is very welcome, and I acknowledge that, but with respect to defence and shipbuilding, there has never been a comprehensive approach taken to this and, therefore, we have not had orderly procurement nor long term planning and investments. We have had major investments into important contracts from time to time but then just a drought for very long periods.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082884">Someone who is not familiar with the shipbuilding industry may say that it is not the government's problem. Do we want the government investing and awarding contracts to shipyards to build naval vessels that we do not need? No, but that is not the point. The reason we need a comprehensive national shipbuilding policy is because of the very heavy investment of public dollars into contracts that are awarded for naval vessels and, most recently, major contracts with respect to frigates and subs. Without a comprehensive national shipbuilding policy, all that investment would fall idle if we did not have a commitment to Canadian shipbuilding of non-defence vessels.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082885">It is not surprising that a lot of concern has been expressed. Unwisely, the government felt that, because of opposition from the existing shipyards and in the absence of a national shipbuilding policy, which, understandably, marine and shipyard workers across the country will be very opposed to, it could award the major contracts for both the frigate and the submarine refits and that would shut them up. It felt that would keep them busy in the short term and that they would not dare speak out because they would be so grateful. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082886">However, what they understand, what they committed to and what they lobbied a long time for was not just the immediate investment in contracts that would benefit them individually as workers or their families, but they had pleaded the case and put forward comprehensive proposals for what a national shipbuilding policy should look like and they still do not have it.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1082887">Therefore, there are major concerns about what will happen to our shipyards and to the jobs of our shipyard workers over time.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082888">The point was made that Norway should be the kind of country with which we would welcome entering into trade deals, and that is true, but that does not mean we can turn our backs on the legitimate problems that have arisen, not because of what it is looking for but because of what we have failed to do in terms or appropriate investments. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082889">As I indicated, many other people have expressed concerns about the impact of this. Some may suggest that it only affects the shipyard workers. However, in his testimony before the committee, the president of the Shipyard General Workers' Federation in British Columbia stated: </ParaText><ParaText id="1082890"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The Canadian shipbuilding industry is already operating at about one-third of its capacity. Canadian demand for ships over the next 15 years is estimated to be worth $9 billion in Canadian jobs. Under the FTAs with Norway, Iceland, and now planned with Korea and then Japan, these Canadian shipbuilding jobs are in serious jeopardy. In these terms, this government's plan is sheer folly and an outrage. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1082891">Is it only the workers who have spoken out? No it is not.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082892">In his testimony before committee, Andrew McArthur, speaking on behalf of the Shipbuilding Association of Canada but long-associated with Irving Shipbuilding Inc. and now in retirement, said:</ParaText><ParaText id="1082893"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">So our position from day one has been that shipbuilding should be carved out from the trade agreement. We butted our heads against a brick wall for quite a number of years on that and we were told there is no carve-out. If the Americans, under the Jones Act, can carve out shipbuilding from NAFTA and other free trade agreements, as I believe the Americans are doing today with Korea, or have done, why can Canada not do the same? ...We have to do something to ensure shipbuilding continues. The easiest thing is to carve it out from EFTA. And if you do one thing, convince your colleagues in government to extend the ship financing facility, make it available to Canadian owners in combination with the accelerated capital cost allowance, and you will have as vibrant an industry as exists</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1082894">However, what has not happened is the kind of response to the expert advice given by those involved in the shipbuilding industry and by the concerns put forward by the shipyard workers themselves.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082895">I want to come back to where the Liberals stand on this. I could not help but think how consistent they have been, and they are consistent if nothing else, on the budget, on the extension of the Afghan counter-insurgency mission and with regard to climate change. They have railed against them, have talked about the problems with them and then have voted for them or did not vote at all.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082896">Today we heard the trade critic for the Liberals say that they really had concerns about shipbuilding. He knows the problems and spoke a bit about them but then said that they would monitor the effect of this on the shipbuilding industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082897">In conclusion, I want to indicate that the New Democratic Party cannot support this bill without a carve out for the shipbuilding industry and without any indication that some of the agricultural implications have been adequately addressed.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Norlock" id="2465318"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78637" Type="2">Mr. Rick Norlock (Northumberland—Quinte West, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1082898">Mr. Speaker, I listened to the hon. member as she spoke about her objection to this great free trade agreement that we are debating now and which looks as though it will come to fruition.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082899">I listened with interest to her criticism of the shipbuilding aspect of it but I also listened when the minister spoke about the agreement and the protection put in it to protect, for many years, our shipbuilding industry. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082900">However, I find it rather curious that here we are creating hundreds of thousands of jobs and perhaps millions of man-hours for people who work in an industry that we all know was at risk, and, in one particular case, the Davie Yards, which was in financial distress and has been for some time, how this bodes well for the health of that particular industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082901">I do not know how the member can construe the tremendous investment by the <Affiliation DbId="111558" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> and the procurement by the Canadian government with regard to defence contracts, in particular, the refurbishing of our fleet, to be a negative.

That is the most effort any government has ever made to protect any particular industry under a free trade agreement.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082910">I would go a step further than that. The Norwegians have just purchased the Davie yard in Quebec. It looks now as if that yard will be profitable, with a lot of jobs and a lot of opportunity for the workforce in Quebec. I am not sure, without a foreign buyer, if this would have happened. I am not sure if that yard would have remained viable. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082911">It is worth discussing. Would the NDP rather see our shipbuilding industry die a slow and painful death and see us lose those high paying, well qualified jobs in this country? That is the direction in which the shipbuilding industry was headed.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082912">This government has done more than any previous government to support shipbuilding, first of all under this agreement, and second, with our frigate program. The <Affiliation DbId="111558" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation> and the Minister of Public Works recently announced $549 million for the Halifax shipyards and $351 million for the Victoria shipyards, respectively, for a refit of Canada's frigate fleet. This is part of $3.2 billion that is going to be spent on refurbishing our fleet in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082913">At the end of the day, this is a good agreement for shipbuilding.

In that area alone, this is a good agreement.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Ms. McDonough" id="2465329"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78793" Type="2">Ms. Alexa McDonough</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1082914">Mr. Speaker, we will just respectfully have to agree to disagree. A great many people in this country, from Newfoundland through to British Columbia, who have decades of experience and an in-depth knowledge of the shipbuilding industry, happen not to agree with the government on this and we happen to agree with them.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082915">One of the reasons, if he wants to know why there is such concern, is that when there were a lot of concerns about the Jones act in the <?bk?>U.S.<?ek?> being exempted from NAFTA and a lot of people in the shipbuilding industry were saying that it was really going to be a blow to the industry, the Conservatives said, “No, this is a great deal”. The Liberals said they were opposed to it, but then they signed it anyway when they got into government. The Conservatives said it was a great deal and there was no problem, but of course we know that is not true.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082916">Let me again quote Andrew McArthur, one of the foremost authorities.

In the short term, they understand, as I have acknowledged, that the refurbishing of the fleet is a very positive thing for the existing shipbuilding industry, but it does not provide what they said was essential: if not a carve-out, then a clear, comprehensive, national shipbuilding policy. We still do not have it. On that basis, they and we cannot support this flawed agreement.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Dhaliwal" id="2465331"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78872" Type="2">Mr. Sukh Dhaliwal (Newton—North Delta, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1082919">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on Bill <Document DbId="3460693" Type="3">C-55</Document>, which would implement the free trade agreement that Canada has negotiated with the European Free Trade Association, which is composed of Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082920">It marks the successful end of nine years of negotiations. This process began under the leadership of the former Liberal government and represents a significant achievement for Canada as a trading nation. It secures free trade with our fifth largest merchandise export destination.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082921">Canada has always been a trading nation. From the early days of fur and fish to the present, when a remarkable 90% of our gross national product is attributable to exports and imports, Canadians have relied on international trade to bolster our economy. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082922">Trade is the way of the future. The ratio of world exports to GDP has more than doubled since 1950. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082923">This agreement is a proud achievement for our trading nation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082924">That being said, I share the legitimate concerns of our country's shipbuilding industry, and I have been careful to examine the provisions affecting that industry before offering my support.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082925">The EFTA agreement strikes a balanced approach by providing new and important market access for Canada's exporters, while also ensuring that an important domestic industry is protected against unfair competition from Norway. Norway subsidized its shipbuilders and built up a tremendous shipbuilding infrastructure, growing the industry into a world leader. However, Norway eliminated its subsidies in 2005 and has no plans to reintroduce them in the future.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082926">Nonetheless, the effect of this buildup still gives the Norwegian industry an advantage. As responsible legislators, we must be careful to ensure that this advantage does not allow it to compete unfairly against our own shipbuilders. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082927">The EFTA agreement provides several protections against this historical advantage. First, it phases out tariffs on ship imports over 15 years, the second longest phase-out ever negotiated in a free trade agreement. This is also the longest tariff phase-out that Canada has ever negotiated. Our negotiators are to be commended for this achievement.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082928">Furthermore, if imports from EFTA countries cause harm to our Canadian shipbuilders during that time, we can revert our tariffs to the pre-free trade tariff rate for up to three years. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082929">This two-pronged approach provides important protection and a long transition period for our shipbuilders. This is the fairest, most balanced deal that can be achieved in the real world.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082930">The only exception to these rules is for the largest type of ships, the post-panamax cargo ships, which is not a size of vessel that our shipyards can produce.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082931">These provisions are critical. A carve-out option for these ships, as suggested by my hon. colleagues in the NDP, was a huge stumbling block to making this important agreement a reality. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1082932">All of this is not to say that shipbuilders will not see some benefits as well. Earlier, the NDP member for <Affiliation DbId="78793" Type="2">Halifax</Affiliation> in fact said that the shipbuilding industry in British Columbia and Atlantic Canada will see some benefits from this agreement.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082933">The buy Canada procurement policy for ships will not be threatened by this agreement, and shipbuilding is also being supported through a $50 million renewal of Industry Canada's structured financing facility.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082934">The objective of the program is to stimulate demand for Canadian-built vessels and increase innovation in our shipyards. It has been able to attract foreign buyers to Canadian shipyards, and the $50 million reinvestment is an important part of continuing this trend.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082935">We should also note that the EFTA agreement presents no threat to our agricultural supply management system. This system is specifically exempted in this agreement.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082936">In my remaining time, I want to talk about the benefits of the trade agreement with EFTA.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082937">The European Free Trade Association is a significant bloc of countries when it comes to their combined economic strength. They are our fifth largest export destination in the world and our twelfth largest destination for foreign direct investment.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082938">Canadian exporters and producers will benefit considerably through the reduction and elimination of tariffs under this agreement. Benefits include the elimination of duties on all non-agricultural goods, the elimination or reduction of tariffs on selected agricultural products, and a level playing field with the European Union exporters in EFTA markets.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082939">There are many farm owners and workers in my community who will be pleased to know that this agreement also eliminates the EFTA countries' agricultural export subsidies for products covered by the agreement. A significant number of agrifood products will receive tariff treatment no less favourable than the tariff treatment accorded to the European Union for the same goods. This is an important competitive gain for our farmers.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082940">The agreement itself is a first generation agreement: it focuses on tariff elimination and trade in goods. Unlike NAFTA, the agreement does not include provisions on investment, services or intellectual property.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082941">The focus on goods is justified. The activities of goods producers account for roughly one-third of total value-added of all industries in the Canadian economy. Between 1997 and 2004, the GDP growth for goods producers averaged 3% per year.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082942">These exclusions have made it an easier deal to secure. However, these provisions should remain long term goals for Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082943">We need to secure provisions on services in the future. Services are the fastest growing part of the economy. Services are things that we cannot drop on our foot. Service producers account for two-thirds of industry-based GDP.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082944">We also need to negotiate agreements on investment. Canadians need to be able to invest abroad with the full confidence that they will be treated equally to domestic producers. If they are not, they need the ability to seek legal solutions.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1082945">Finally, we will also need to secure an agreement on intellectual property. An intellectual property policy provides the foundation for investment and growth opportunities in the knowledge-based economy. When we look at our future generation, if we have to compete with giant markets like China and India, we will have to be a self-sustained knowledge-based economy here in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082946">The free trade agreement with EFTA does not cover safeguards, anti-dumping and countervailing duties, which will continue to be addressed at the World Trade Organization. However, there are provisions that will allow these issues to be revisited after three years, leading to more negotiations and potential gains later on.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082947">The EFTA agreement also has a strategic importance that cannot be discounted. It shows the European Union that we are a serious and important partner, which will help our hope to eventually secure free trade with the European Union.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082948">Yet, the EFTA countries are important in their own right. There has been significant growth in our exports to them, with the past few years showing an amazing 27.6% annual increase in merchandise exports. They are an important market for Canadian natural resources, industrial products and forestry products.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082949">The EFTA countries are also our seventh largest source of imports, including medical products, chemicals and machinery. My colleagues may not be surprised to know that Switzerland is also a key supplier of clocks and chocolate to Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082950">There is also strong foreign direct investment between both sides of this new agreement. Canadian direct investment abroad within these four countries totalled $8.4 billion in 2006. Similarly, Canada is an attractive place for foreign direct investment from EFTA. In 2006, the EFTA bloc invested a total of $15.6 billion in Canada, which was up an unbelievable $9.7 billion from 2004.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082951">This agreement is also welcomed from the point of view of the relationship with Europe more widely. We have found common ground with four European countries. My daughter is currently studying medicine at a school in Europe.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082952">As I go on with this case, I can see that we have a market that we should also be looking forward to because of the strength that the European Union brings to this agreement. We can have a marketplace to go to. This should also help us to find common ground with a much larger and more diverse European Union in the future. The EFTA agreement is an important stepping stone on the path to a Canada-European Union free trade agreement.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082953">Other immediate advantages also include opportunities for trade diversification and enhanced industrial cooperation. We will also have a leg up on the U.S., which has yet to sign such an agreement with EFTA. It also keeps Canada ahead of China, which is already negotiating its own free trade agreement, and India, which is expected to begin negotiations this year.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082954">The Liberal Party supports the broad, multilateral process of trade liberalization under the World Trade Organization. Securing equal access to all countries is ideal. It is especially important for countries where it would be difficult for Canada to get a deal with on the same terms, or even at all, due to our relative size.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1082955">Multilateral, non-discriminatory trade liberalization is the ideal. However, given what we are currently experiencing, the multilateral process is often cumbersome and slow. Regional trade agreements, like the one concluded between Canada and the EFTA, can be good and useful supplements to the multilateral process. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082956">Finally, the agreement also has symbolic importance: it increases investor confidence, even without provisions on investment in the deal. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082957">Culturally, Canada shares close ties with the EFTA countries. The largest Icelandic population outside Iceland is in Canada, estimated at more than 100,000 people. Large numbers of Canadians hail from the other member countries of the EFTA. Our countries share the values of democracy, freedom, human rights, freedom of expression and free market economies. We have so much in common with these countries.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082958">Canada is a trading nation and the Liberal Party is the party of free trade. The EFTA agreement is an important agreement and it represents a launching pad to larger trade possibilities down the road. This is a trading relationship that every member in this House should rise to support. I thank the House for giving me the opportunity to share my views. I welcome questions from hon. members.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Crowder" id="2465338"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78928" Type="2">Ms. Jean Crowder (Nanaimo—Cowichan, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1082959">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="3460693" Type="3">C-55</Document>, the Canada-EFTA free trade agreement. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082960">As other members in the House have pointed out, this agreement has been in discussions for a long time. In fact, the European Free Trade Association and Canada first started their negotiations under the Liberals in 1997 but, ironically, it stalled in the year 2000 over shipbuilding issues. Here we are once again, in 2008, talking about concerns over the shipbuilding issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082961">There are a number of good reasons why New Democrats have raised concerns about this agreement. Part of it is about the track record of the current Conservative government. All we have to do is look to the softwood sellout and look at the impact of what is happening in ridings from coast to coast to coast around the softwood agreement and some of the subsequent impacts on forestry policy. What we do not have, of course, is any kind of national strategy around forestry.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082962">In addition, in the House today the government was talking about 22,000 jobs being created but what it failed to say is that the jobless rate rose in April to 6.1% and, in fact, manufacturing continued to decline in April with losses in Ontario and British Columbia. The number of factory workers has decreased by 112,000 since April 2007, according to Statistics Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082963">I want to return to forestry for one second because it directly relates to what we are seeing in the shipbuilding sector. With the government's policies around softwood and raw log exports, because of course it has a federal role, what we have seen particularly in British Columbia and my riding of <Affiliation DbId="78928" Type="2">Nanaimo—Cowichan</Affiliation> is one sawmill after another close. This has had an impact on the pulp and paper industry because it does not have access to fibre supply.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082964">An article by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives in June 2007 stated: </ParaText><ParaText id="1082965"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Numerous opportunities to generate jobs from forest resources are routinely squandered.

But I think the record in the forestry sector is an important one to note in the House because it directly relates to trade agreements. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082968">The government is saying, “Trust us. We have built in a 15 year window to protect the shipbuilding industry. Just trust us that somehow or other our workers and communities will survive throughout this”. Because the softwood agreement is so fresh in people's memories, it is very difficult to believe that the government will put the measures in place that will actually protect the shipbuilding industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082969">In the early 1980s, the shipbuilding industry was a robust industry in Canada and there were a number of shipyards from coast to coast that were very successful, but in the mid-1980s, 1986 or thereabouts, we started to see a rationalization in the shipbuilding industry. </ParaText><ParaText id="1082970">I want to acknowledge the member for <Affiliation DbId="78886" Type="2">Sackville—Eastern Shore</Affiliation>. We all know that any time a question comes up in the House with regard to industrial strategy in this country, the member for Sackville—Eastern Shore will remind members that we must put shipbuilding into that context. Although he has been tireless with his advocacy for this, the government and the former Liberal government simply failed to do that.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082971">I also want to mention the member for <Affiliation DbId="78793" Type="2">Halifax</Affiliation> who acknowledged the fact that some work has been done to shore up, so to speak, the shipbuilding industry over the last while. However, we do not have a long term sustainable plan. The government itself has acknowledged the critical role that shipbuilding plays in terms of our sovereignty. Yet, it simply has not put the effort into developing that plan.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082972">When the NDP expressed its concerns about the lack of carve-out provisions in this particular agreement, this position was not developed in isolation. This position was developed in conjunction with the industry and the trade unions.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1082973"> The board of directors from the Shipbuilding Association of Canada and the Canadian Auto Workers Union came before the committee and talked about some elements that they saw as being essential to be included.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082974">We are not just opposing the agreement. We are proposing solutions in conjunction with people who are on the ground in this industry. They have asked for a carve out, saying that shipbuilding must be excluded from the agreement. They said that the federal government should immediately help put together a structured financing facility and an accelerated capital cost allowance for the industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082975">Earlier when we heard the minister speak, I put a question to him about the Jones act and the minister said that it was domestic policy. Let me talk about the Jones act for one second.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082976">The U.S. has always refused to repeal the Jones act. It is legislation that has been in place since 1920. It was legislation that was deliberately developed to protect U.S. capacity to produce commercial ships. The Jones act requires that commerce between <?bk?>U.S.<?ek?> ports on the inland and intercoastal waterways be reserved for vessels that are U.S. built, U.S. owned, registered under U.S. law and U.S. manned. In addition to that, and the minister said that this was domestic policy, the U.S. has also refused to include shipbuilding under NAFTA and has implemented in recent years a heavily subsidized naval reconstruction program.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082977">If the United States, and many members of the House will tout it as the bastion of free enterprise, could see fit to work to protect its shipbuilding industry, surely Canada could do the same thing. This is even more critical in light of the sovereignty issue, but also we have the longest coastline in the world. We should have a vibrant and healthy shipbuilding industry, and it should be everything from small pleasure craft right the way up to the large vessels.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082978">I talked earlier about some of the closures. I come from British Columbia and although this was a provincial government decision, we all know that many times provincial government decisions are influenced by policy at the federal government level.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082979"> I want to read from a press release of December 13, 2007, from the B.C.

It does not subsidize its industry because the government of Norway, over a number of years, put subsidies in place, developed a long term industrial strategy and looked at training and support of the workforce.</ParaText><ParaText id="1082999">We would expect to see that kind of initiative from the government. Because people keep talking about how long a time span 15 years is, what should be done is the carve out should happen so those plans can be put in place and our shipbuilding industry can build on its already considerable strength, because we are world class shipbuilders.

Second reading and concurrence in Senate amendments</ProceduralText><ParaText id="1083010"> moved the second reading of, and concurrence in, amendments made by the Senate to Bill <Document DbId="3073233" Type="4">C-293, An Act respecting the provision of official development assistance abroad</Document>. </ParaText><ParaText id="1083011">He said: Mr. Speaker, thank you for this, I hope, final opportunity to speak to the bill. Just for the purposes of those who might be watching this debate, we are anticipating that the debate will collapse today, that it will go to a vote and that this will be the final debate on this bill. I am hoping for that and seeking the assurance of my colleagues in the House that we will work on that basis.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083012">This has been a long journey. It started almost two years ago. There is a saying that “it takes a village to raise a child”. Well, it takes a caucus to raise a bill and it takes another caucus to raise a bill. I want to publicly thank my colleagues in the NDP caucus for their support and it takes the caucus of the Bloc Québécois to raise this bill. I want to thank the government, particularly the minister of international development assistance, for her assistance in finally bringing this bill to the stage that it is at today.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1083013">Most important, I want to thank the thousands of Canadians who supported this bill through visits to their MPs, telephone calls to senators, emails, letters, petitions, rallies outside on Parliament Hill and literally tens of thousands of names that were put forward on petitions supporting this bill. I am hoping today is the payoff day. I hope those thousands of Canadians who supported this bill over the last two years and have been very faithful in their support, will raise a glass to themselves tonight and say “job well done”, because today is, hopefully, the end of Bill <Document DbId="3073233" Type="4">C-293</Document>, that it will receive royal assent and then move from the position of being a bill to being law.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083014">I am afraid that if I start thanking all the people I need to thank for this bill, I will defeat myself and run out the clock. I will try to be brief on the people who I need to thank because they have been very supportive. As I said, the Bloc and the NDP caucuses have been there from the beginning and I want to particularly acknowledge the work of the member for <Affiliation DbId="78793" Type="2">Halifax</Affiliation> who has been steadfast in her support.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1083015">I also want to thank the leadership of the Liberal Party, both the interim leader, the hon. Bill Graham, and our current leadership, the House leadership and the Senate leadership who have been steadfast throughout, particularly the whip and our House leaders.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083016">My special thanks go to the member for <Affiliation DbId="78343" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</Affiliation>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78627" Type="2">Richmond Hill</Affiliation>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78797" Type="2">Dartmouth—Cole Harbour</Affiliation>, and the member for <Affiliation DbId="105598" Type="2">London North Centre</Affiliation>, all of whom have personally encouraged me in many different ways and stepped into the breach when they needed to.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083017">I also want to acknowledge my thanks to Senator Segal, Senator Smith and Senator Cowan who, in the other place, were very pivotal in moving this bill forward. </ParaText><ParaText id="1083018">Indeed, I would be remiss if I did not thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="78477" Type="2">Mississauga South</Affiliation> who navigated me and this bill through the increasingly complex labyrinth called private members' business.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083019">It also would be remiss of me if I did not thank my friend, Gerry Barr, from the Canadian Council for International Co-operation, for his support throughout this two year period. His tenacity is incredible and we called upon all of his formidable organizational and intellectual skills to see that this bill would receive royal assent.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083020">I also want to thank Professor Aaron Freeman for his invaluable legal assistance at particular points in drafting and when we had to renegotiate when a royal recommendation was needed.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1083021">Who can forget the Engineers without Borders who phoned me, literally out of the blue, and encouraged me and invited me to their conference and got behind this bill. It is so encouraging to see young, bright, vibrant, energetic people, our nation's future, get behind a bill such as this and give it their enthusiastic push.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083022">Evangelical Fellowship of Canada has been stalwart, as have World Vision, Results Canada, Make Poverty History and literally hundreds of other NGOs who saw that this bill would be a good allocation of public resources.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1083023">I was greatly honoured to have General Roméo Dallaire, now Senator Roméo Dallaire, as my bill's Senate sponsor. He is a moral force for good in this nation and a hero to many of us. I am greatly honoured to have had him sponsor this bill in the Senate. He moved the bill forward with the moral authority that only General Dallaire has.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083024">I do not want to get into all of the thanks, but I just have to thank my staff, Robyn Mogan, Trish Renaud, Kein Turner, Anna-Christina Gamillscheg and Janice Luke, and of course my family who has heard more about this bill than it ever cared to hear about it, my wife Carolyn Dartnell, my sons Ian and Nathan, and my daughters Caitlin, Rachel and Sarah. I would go home on a Thursday or Friday night and they would hear all the stories about Bill <Document DbId="3073233" Type="4">C-293</Document>. I want to thank them publicly.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083025">We are all here to make a difference. We aspire to make a difference here. We leave our jobs, our families and our communities to come here to try to make a difference. This bill could actually make a difference in the lives of so many people who are impoverished in our world.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1083026">I call upon those who will be called to fulfill this law, to fulfill it not only in practice but also in spirit and to fulfill it with enthusiasm. We should not let the cynics get us down. This is a law that actually could make a difference in how Canada is perceived in the world and how we minister to those who are impoverished.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083027">In January of last year I travelled to Kenya with Results Canada. One of our stops was at a hospital in western Kenya. We were visiting AIDS patients. The hospital is literally divided into two parts: on the one side were men and on the other side were women, all of whom were either sick or dying. There were 50 beds for men, 50 beds for women, and 70 patients on each side. As one can imagine, there was more than one patient in some of the beds. Some of these people were literally on their last legs, and the nurses told us that two or three would die that day. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1083028">Part of the hospital services was to make available job training in a workplace training centre, so we visited there. I can still see this woman who was sitting at a sewing machine making handbags. She had a huge smile. She was wearing a red dress. She can make about five handbags a day. She is paid the rough equivalent of 65¢ a day. She looked up at me and said, “I am HIV positive. I choose to live my life as HIV negative. I want to live long enough to see my child marry. I thank Jesus for every day he gives me”.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083029">That had an impact on me. I know it had an impact on our delegation. That is why it is so important that Bill <Document DbId="3073233" Type="4">C-293</Document> receive royal assent. Maybe that woman and thousands of others might well be positively affected by Bill C-293.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083030">I want to conclude by thanking each and every member here for his or her support. I want to thank everyone for the support that we have received from literally thousands of Canadians around the country. I want to thank those in the NGO community in particular and my friend Gerry Barr for all of their persistence in seeing that today arrived. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I am not ashamed to say that there were concerns that I held with the original form of this piece of legislation, and I will refer to those later, but I do congratulate the hon. member for putting up with my arguments and my encouragement for him to accept amendments that I personally and some of my colleagues on this side of the House thought would make it a more effective bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083032">I am encouraged to see that we are addressing this matter of very serious concern to all Canadians and to many people living in poor countries around the world. I am sure the thoughts of all members are with those in Burma specifically today, in light of the tragedy that is unfolding there.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083033">Private member's Bill <Document DbId="3073233" Type="4">C-293, an act respecting the provision of official development assistance abroad</Document>, was introduced in the House of Commons on May 17, 2006. The intent of the bill is and always was consistent with the priorities of this government, especially the priorities of poverty reduction and the promotion of human rights.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1083034">The proposed amendments to Bill <Document DbId="3073233" Type="4">C-293</Document> address most of the government's stated concerns regarding clarity of mandate, strengthened accountability and greater aid effectiveness. The proposed amendments address our main concerns and make the bill even better. They also provide consistency with the government's three point plan for aid effectiveness. </ParaText><ParaText id="1083035">The result of these amendments will be legislation that strengthens the aid program and adds a useful tool to Canada's efforts to reduce poverty, as well as improve living standards for families and communities in the harshest regions of the world.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083036">This government has made it clear that poverty reduction is the overarching purpose of our international development assistance in poor countries, places where Canada can and is able to make a difference in the lives of people who just need a helping hand. There should be no doubt that poverty reduction is central to all of our international development assistance efforts, and while Canadians are eager to help the poorest of the poor, they want reassurances that their tax dollars are making a real difference in the lives of the people that they are intended to help.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083037">Canadians have told us that they want their government to lead by example in the area of international assistance by delivering on its promises, ensuring aid is effective, and implementing innovative approaches to development cooperation. In response, this government has been working to improve aid effectiveness through greater focus, efficiency, accountability and results.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1083038">The government has demonstrated this through a concrete three point plan for aid effectiveness, which is helping to transform how Canada delivers aid around the world and which represents a commitment to greater results and accountability.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083039">Budgets 2007 and 2008 laid out details of this plan to meet Canadians' expectations by establishing a clear direction for Canada's international assistance. The plan concentrates on three important areas: strengthening focus, so that our development assistance to other countries is consistent with our foreign policy objectives; improving the efficiency of Canadian aid, to reduce administrative costs and improve overseas field presence to areas where we can get better mileage for our aid dollars; and most important, building in greater accountability.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083040">For Canadian taxpayers to understand and support Canada's effective role in international development assistance, they need to be reassured that we are committed to using tools such as independent evaluations and objective assessments that help achieve results and communicate these results to Canadians.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1083041">In this way the government has begun to transform the way we deliver aid around the world. In doing so, the government has increased engagement in the Americas. It is doubling assistance to the Caribbean. It has increased presence and resources in fragile states like Afghanistan and Haiti.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083042">In the last two years the government has made significant progress in reforming Canada's international assistance and shaping it to meet new priorities. We have undertaken long term commitments to Afghanistan and Haiti.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083043">As our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has announced previously, we are re-engaging Canada in the Americas and doubling our assistance to the Caribbean. In addition, we are ensuring that Canada is meeting its <?bk?>G-8<?ek?> commitment to Africa.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083044">The government's commitment to the most vulnerable was most recently demonstrated by our response to the current food crisis. We allocated substantial new funding for food aid to help those most in need. Canada has maximized the effectiveness of this contribution by untying restrictions on food aid procurement. </ParaText><ParaText id="1083045">I want to pause for a moment to emphasize what an important step this is. From consultations with members across the aisle, and with the industry leaders in the agricultural community, this was a non-political, non-partisan measure. It will result in saved lives and it is the right thing to do. It is an example of this government making Parliament work and I am proud of it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1083046">This has provided the World Food Programme and the Canadian Foodgrains Bank with the flexibility to procure food commodities from all countries, especially from developing countries. By removing these restrictions, Canada is promoting the growth of local and regional markets in developing countries. This will contribute to longer term solutions to the problem of world hunger. </ParaText><ParaText id="1083047">In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that removing the restrictions is just one way whereby the Government of Canada is demonstrating that we are serious about working efficiently and effectively, while taking into account the needs and the perspectives of the poor.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083048">After working a great deal on this file with colleagues, and especially with my friend from <Affiliation DbId="78463" Type="2">Scarborough—Guildwood</Affiliation>, I recognize our discussions were not always as pleasant as one would like, and could have even been extremely frustrating if we had not moved forward with this process. However, I thank my friend for his hard work on this file and congratulate the <Affiliation DbId="111559" Type="4">Minister of International Cooperation</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="111553" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="78741" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation> for their willingness to show leadership on this very important file. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

He knows he can count on the Bloc Québécois to support the Senate amendments. This motion gives us an opportunity to debate them.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083050">The Bloc Québécois has done serious and thorough work, as the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78463" Type="2">Scarborough—Guildwood</Affiliation> mentioned in his presentation shortly before I took the floor. We are in favour of this bill that is still quite useful even though some of the amendments we proposed in the process were rejected. The important thing is that the substance of the bill is still very relevant and it is a firm step in the right direction.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1083051">The Senate amendments under consideration today are minor; they clarify certain provisions of the legislation. Let us look at them together.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083052">For example, the Senate is proposing that the principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness be respected. It is also proposing that “competent minister” means:</ParaText><ParaText id="1083053">
								<Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The Minister of International Cooperation, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Finance or any other minister who is providing official development assistance. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1083054">The Senate also proposes that:</ParaText><ParaText id="1083055">
								<Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The competent minister shall consult with governments, international agencies and Canadian civil society organizations at least once every two years, and shall take their views and recommendations into consideration when forming an opinion. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1083056">The last Senate amendment reads:</ParaText><ParaText id="1083057">
								<Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Information shall not be reported under this section if its disclosure is prohibited by the policies of the Bretton Woods institutions.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1083058">In our eyes, these are truly minor amendments that, as I was saying earlier, clarify certain provisions of the legislation. We are intent on passing this bill and will therefore maintain our support for it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083059">I would like to remind those watching us on television of the content of this bill introduced by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78463" Type="2">Scarborough—Guildwood</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1083060">This bill would ensure official development assistance with the very specific goal of reducing poverty. It would also require that CIDA, when providing assistance, be respectful of the target environments. This is a very important element.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083061">In fact, once this proposed bill is put into action, the government will have to consult civil society organizations, governments and international agencies to ensure that our proposals actually respond to the major needs of the people we want to help. </ParaText><ParaText id="1083062">This bill is very interesting because it guarantees transparency in the activities of the department responsible for international cooperation. It requires that at the end of each fiscal year the minister produce a report containing a summary of the development assistance projects, advisory committee reports and CIDA's performance report. The minister is also required to issue a statistical report on the disbursement of development assistance.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1083063">As I said earlier, we had some reservations, but we support the main objective and the fundamental purpose of the bill, which is to reduce world poverty through development assistance. However, we must condemn the current lack of resources provided to CIDA. We hope that once this bill has been passed, the government will truly keep its promises and increase funding for this important agency.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083064"> Specifically, this bill sets out criteria respecting resource allocation to international development agencies and enhances transparency in development assistance. It states that poverty reduction is the central focus of development assistance, and it takes into account the perspectives of the poor. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1083065">Assistance must also be consistent with international human rights standards. The bill also states that the minister shall consult with governments, agencies and civil society organizations. What is interesting and important to note is that, at the end of each fiscal year, the minister must provide a summary of the development assistance projects, present a comprehensive report on CIDA's performance, and present a statistical report on the disbursement of development assistance. </ParaText><ParaText id="1083066">It is easy to see the connection with the UN's millennium development goals. As a reminder, the eight objectives are to: eradicate extreme poverty and hunger; achieve universal primary education; promote gender equality and empower women; reduce female mortality; improve maternal health; combat HIV-AIDS, malaria and other diseases; ensure environmental sustainability; and develop a global partnership for development.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083067">Bill <Document DbId="3073233" Type="4">C-293</Document> covers two of these eight points, which we think is a step in the right direction.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1083068">One way or another, all of the millennium goals are related to poverty. We must not forget that poverty is often the result of social and economic inequality in a given country. As I said, this bill is a step in the right direction. It sets criteria for official development assistance and ensures that it targets poverty reduction. Because of that, we support the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083069">Moreover, as one of the richest countries in the world, Canada must do everything it can to help citizens of poor countries escape their poverty. Doing nothing would be both immoral and unacceptable.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083070">In closing, I would like, once again, to congratulate the member for <Affiliation DbId="78463" Type="2">Scarborough—Guildwood</Affiliation> on his work. I also appreciate his thanks to the opposition for having helped him achieve the goal of getting his bill passed so that it can come into force to reduce poverty and help other countries that really need help.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I am almost inclined to say almost nothing and quit while I am ahead, because there has been a rare coming together here of a collaborative nature.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083072"> There have been a lot of disagreements and a lot of pushing and shoving. I want to be fair here and acknowledge the parliamentary secretary, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78843" Type="2">Macleod</Affiliation>, who set out some very severe reservations about some of the aspects of this bill. I think he is the only parliamentary secretary who ever did actually extend the courtesy of sitting down with me in my office to discuss something. We had some major disagreements and there have been some compromises made.</ParaText><ParaText id="1083073">However, at a time when a lot of the public looks on this place these days with a good deal of consternation and sees the dysfunctionality, the division and the dissension, it has to be a good day for us to come together around what is truly a global commitment, about which I think we feel good as parliamentarians and about which Canadians I think very much feel that we need to work together. It is not always easy to do. We have had to make compromises along the way.</ParaText>
