Report Stage</ProceduralText><ParaText id="2640654">
The House resumed from December 6 consideration of Bill <Document DbId="5194714" Type="3">C-20, An Act to amend the Constitution Act, 1867, the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act and the Canada Elections Act</Document>, as reported (without amendment) from the committee, and of the motions in Group No. 1.
</ParaText><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Lukiwski" id="5253261"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170850" Type="18">Mr. Tom Lukiwski (Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2640655">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to stand in this place and talk about Bill <Document DbId="5194714" Type="3">C-20</Document>, our government's bill to move towards fairer representation by population in the House of Commons.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640656">When Bill <Document DbId="5194714" Type="3">C-20</Document> is passed, hopefully in a few days, it will be a fulfillment of a long-term commitment by our party to try and ensure that we get fairer representation by population in this place. I say “fairer” because I do not think we could ever achieve perfection in terms of population and representation that would be proportional to all provinces and fair to all provinces. In fact, some estimates suggest that if we were to look at exactly fair and accurate representation by population, we would need over 900 members in this place. Clearly that is not acceptable. It is not acceptable to our government and it would not be acceptable to the Canadian public.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640657">However, we have recognized the fact that some of the faster growing provinces, specifically Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta, have been significantly under-represented in this place for many years. That is because the status quo formula that deals with population increases of provinces is flawed. In fact, if we stayed with the status quo, we would see significant under-representation, in those three provinces in particular, from now and into the future. The bill would address that. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2640658">We have amended the formula so that now and in the future there would be more accurate estimates of population. The formula would give this government, or the government of the day, the opportunity to increase seats in those provinces that have faster growing populations. That is just a fundamental aspect of democracy. We recognize the fact that a vote in one region of the country should weigh no more than a vote in another region of the country. Unfortunately, currently, that is not the case.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640659">I will give a couple of examples to illustrate what I am saying here.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640660">In my home riding of Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, I represent approximately 80,000 constituents. Yet, here in Ontario, there are certain ridings where the member of Parliament represents well over 170,000 constituents. Members can see that one could successfully argue that my vote in the House of Commons weighs more than the vote of a member of Parliament in Ontario who represents over twice as many people. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2640661">The formula we have brought forward addresses that inequity. We have amended the formula to increase the number of seats in those faster growing provinces. As such, members of Parliament would have an opportunity to truly reflect the wishes of their constituents. At the same time, we assure this House and the Canadian people that we will not unduly punish those provinces with smaller, slower growing populations.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640662">The formula we have developed considers an average population size by riding, which is approximately 111,000. The formula would see an additional 30 seats introduced to the House of Commons: 15 in Ontario, 6 in British Columbia, 6 in Alberta and 3 in Quebec. This would bring our total in the House of Commons to 338. More importantly, it would ensure that in the three fastest growing provinces by population, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia, the number of members would more accurately reflect the population, and that population is how we ultimately determine how many members of Parliament serve in this place.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2640663">I do not want to dwell too much on the formula. I think that has been debated long and hard over the past weeks. However, I do want to point out that if we do not address this inequity, we will have a situation where the boundaries commissions will start to do their work in February of next year, and start aligning boundaries based on the old population estimates.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2640664">We have to pass this legislation now. We have to pass it in this place and get it into the Senate. It has to pass in the Senate before the end of the year because the boundaries commissions need to start their work early next year. The Chief Electoral Officer of Canada has advised us that if we do not get this legislation passed before the end of this year, it could jeopardize the efforts of his office to get new boundaries and new members of Parliament in place before the next election, scheduled for 2015. </ParaText><ParaText id="2640665">There is a sense of urgency here. That is why I am imploring all members of this place to join with us and make sure we get speedy passage of <Document DbId="5194714" Type="3">Bill C-20</Document> before we rise for Christmas.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2640666">When the boundaries commissions start their work in February of next year, hopefully they will be working with new population estimates provided by Statistics Canada. These estimates would allow them to better determine not only how many more seats may be required in each province, but also where those boundaries would be. This is an important piece of work. We know that there would probably be instances in the three provinces with the faster growing populations where current members of Parliament might end up in a new riding with new boundaries but not even reside in that new riding. This is where we would need interventions from the general public, members of Parliament and all stakeholders. We would need to try and ensure that not only is there fair representation but also that those problems that might occur through boundary redistribution are dealt with. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2640667">Each province will have a new boundaries commission assigned, a three member board to deal with the process of establishing new boundaries. I suggest to all members that they actively involve themselves in this process. They will want to ensure that, when boundaries are to be changed in their province, they have an opportunity to speak to the boundaries commission. They would want to ensure that they are not unduly affected by significant boundary realignment. Not that it would be deliberate, but the mere function of adding seats, for example, 15 more seats in Ontario's case, would change boundaries significantly.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640668">In the case of Ontario, where one member of Parliament may be serving over 170,000 constituents, there is a very real possibility that riding would then become two ridings. Depending on where the member of Parliament resides in that riding, he or she could find himself or herself as a sitting member of Parliament, but not in the riding that he or she once had. Therefore, all members should pay particular attention to the process.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2640669">I want to point out one other unassailable fact. In Canada, we pride ourselves for being one of the most progressive democracies in the world. We pride ourselves for ensuring that all of our citizens are well represented by their members, whether at the federal, provincial or municipal level. If we do not pass <Document DbId="5194714" Type="3">Bill C-20</Document> and deal with the fact that our population is growing rapidly, we will have a situation where our citizens are under-represented and do not have an effective voice in the House of Commons. This is something that we will not allow to happen. That is why Bill C-20 has been brought forward for consideration by the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640670">Finally, while <Document DbId="5194714" Type="3">Bill C-20</Document> may not be a perfect solution, it is a far better solution than the status quo population by representation legislation. We are trying to ensure that not only do we address the inequities today, but also that we address the inequities as we move forward.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2640671">Ten years from now, when we go through the next boundary realignment, the formula that we have introduced in Bill <Document DbId="5194714" Type="3">C-20</Document> will ensure that those provinces that have faster growing populations will get the representation they deserve.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Lamoureux" id="5253499"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170750" Type="2">Mr. Kevin Lamoureux (Winnipeg North, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2640672">Mr. Speaker, I ask the member why is it that his government does not recognize what 95% of all Canadians want?Canadians do not believe it is necessary to increase the number of members of Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640673">In fact, when the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> years ago was not the Prime Minister, he advocated that the House of Commons be somewhere around 265 members. He suggested that, at the very least, we should put a cap on the number of members of Parliament. Many Canadians are wondering what caused the Prime Minister to change his mind. </ParaText><ParaText id="2640674">I do not need to table a poll. I suggest we consult with our constituents. We would find that a vast majority of them, over 95%, would say that we do not need more politicians. The government might not want to hear that, but that is the reality.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640675">Canadians want to know why the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is flip-flopping on his opinion. Why, when he was in opposition, did he say that we do not need any more members of Parliament, that we should be reducing the number of parliamentarians in the House of Commons? Why the change?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Lukiwski" id="5253524"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170850" Type="18">Mr. Tom Lukiwski</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2640676">Mr. Speaker, I am sure my hon. colleague feels better now that he has had his daily rant.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640677">Let me point out a couple of quick facts. First, we have a couple of constitutional provisions that we must observe: the Senate floor and the grandfather clause.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640678">Second, the Liberal solution is to start picking winners and losers. That is unacceptable to us. I would suggest if the member opposite had done his homework, as I have done, and consulted with premiers of various provinces, he would find this would be unacceptable to the premiers as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640679">What we are doing is ensuring that there will be fair representation. No province is to be unduly affected by reducing the number of representatives it has; it is a fact that our population is increasing yearly.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640680">This will be a solution that not only gains the support of the Canadian public but gains the support of all provinces. Under the Liberal plan of taking seats away from provinces, I can guarantee that would start a loud and vocal opposition and would unduly affect government relations between the provinces and the federal government. That is something we do not want.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640681">Our Bill <Document DbId="5194714" Type="3">C-20</Document> addresses the matter fairly and accurately.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

What is urgent for my constituents and my riding is solving problems. For example, I live in a community affected by the forestry crisis. The five largest employers in the region have closed their doors. People have much more serious worries, such as the lack of Internet access, for example. Service Canada services are being moved online, so people in my riding do not have access to these services right now.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640684">As for quality of representation, everyone working here should be more productive and target the problems that the public deems more serious and practical. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Although I recognize there are other issues of importance to the member opposite and his constituents, we are debating Bill <Document DbId="5194714" Type="3">C-20</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640686">I would only point to the matter of urgency. The Chief Electoral Officer has indicated we must get this bill passed quickly because the process of boundaries commissions looking at realigning boundaries will occur regardless of Bill <Document DbId="5194714" Type="3">C-20</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640687">Some members of the opposition have suggested that we should wait a bit to investigate, discuss and debate the bill longer. They say that if a year from now, we determine that we want to pass Bill <Document DbId="5194714" Type="3">C-20</Document>, that will still give the boundaries commissions time to do their work. That is not the case. It would be a duplication of effort because boundaries commissions will start their work in February, whether it is under the status quo or under the new Bill <Document DbId="5194714" Type="3">C-20</Document>. If we had a situation where Bill <Document DbId="5194714" Type="3">C-20</Document> were delayed by a year, the boundaries commissions in each province would have done a year's worth of work. They would then have to go back to square one under the provisions of Bill <Document DbId="5194714" Type="3">C-20</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640688">We need to get the bill passed and passed quickly.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Opitz" id="5253617"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170886" Type="2">Mr. Ted Opitz (Etobicoke Centre, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2640689">Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure to stand in the House to discuss Bill <Document DbId="5194714" Type="3">C-20</Document> today, the fair representation act.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640690">Our government received a strong mandate to move toward representation by population in the House of Commons. As the representative for <Affiliation DbId="170886" Type="2">Etobicoke Centre</Affiliation> and a proud Ontarian, I am delighted that the Government of Canada is moving in the right direction to ensure that the under-represented provinces, such as my own, receive the representation that they deserve. </ParaText><ParaText id="2640691">Each and every citizen of this great country deserves to have representation that is fair and balanced. The fair representation act would move every province toward representation by population and, in particular, by reflecting three distinct promises our government made to provide fair representation: first, allocating an increased number of seats now and in the future to better reflect population growth in Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta; second, maintaining the number of seats for smaller provinces; and third, maintaining the proportional representation of Quebec according to its population.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640692">We campaigned on these promises and Canadians voted for a strong, stable, national, majority Conservative government, which is here to deliver on the promises we made to Canadians. We gave our word and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the government will keep the promises that we made to Canadians.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2640693">The representation of the provinces in the House of Commons is readjusted every 10 years using the formula established in section 51 of the Constitution Act. The current formula dates to 1985 and was designed to provide modest increases to the size of the House. While the 1985 formula has been successful in limiting the size of the House of Commons, it has created a representation gap for the faster growing provinces, Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640694">The current formula maintains this serious under-representation and, in fact, will worsen as time passes and as the Canadian population continues to increase.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640695">As an example, well over 60% of Canada's population is, and would continue to be, seriously and increasingly under-represented using the current formula. The combined effect of fixing the divisor at 279, in combination with the existence of the seat guarantees in the Constitution, has prevented Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta from receiving a share of seats that is commensurate with their relative share of the overall population. This is not acceptable and, most to the point, it is not fair. Bill <Document DbId="5194714" Type="3">C-20</Document> would address this problem.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2640696">The formula in Bill <Document DbId="5194714" Type="3">C-20</Document> is principled and is a reasonable update designed to bring those provinces closer to representation by population, while at the same time maintaining the seat count of the slower growing provinces and ensuring that Quebec maintains the level of seats that is proportionate to its population. In fact, the fair representation act brings every province closer to representation by population.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640697">The three large faster growing and under-represented provinces would move closer to fair representation and would be fairly treated in the future. That is then fair. In this way, the foundational principle of representation by population would be much better respected and maintained now and in the future.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640698">Population growth within those provinces has been even higher in large urban and suburban areas. Canada's new and visible minority population is increasing largely through immigration and these immigrants tend to settle in fast-growing communities in our fastest growing provinces. The situation inadvertently causes Canadians in large urban centres, new Canadians and visible minorities to be even more under-represented than is the average.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640699">It is clear that this situation undermines the principle of representation by population in our country and the need for Bill <Document DbId="5194714" Type="3">C-20</Document> to become law as soon as possible.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2640700">The pragmatic course of action, namely the application of the new formula, would be to add an additional 30 seats to the House of Commons for a total of 338. In terms of the provincial breakdown, Ontario would receive 15 new seats. Alberta would receive 6 new seats and British Columbia would receive 6 new seats. Quebec would receive three new seats as a result of the new representation rule, which would ensure that its seat total does not come under the number of seats proportionate to its population.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640701">Finally, the bill provides an adjustment to the formula in order to account for future increases in population counts following future censuses</ParaText><ParaText id="2640702">For the 2021 and each subsequent readjustment, the bill provides that the electoral quotient would be increased by the simple average of provincial population growth rates since the preceding readjustment.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640703">The serious and increasing under-representation of our faster growing provinces, Ontario first among them, is a serious problem that requires an immediate solution. The Chief Electoral Officer told the procedure and House affairs committee that passing this bill before the new year is the best scenario. We are moving quickly to meet the deadlines we face in the new year to best facilitate the process that will bring these changes into place for Canadians.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2640704">In addition to the updated formula for allocating seats, Bill <Document DbId="5194714" Type="3">C-20</Document> also proposes amendments to the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act that aim to streamline the timelines in the current boundary readjustment process. There will be no change to the timelines relating to the parliamentary phase of the electoral boundary process and, most important, Canadians will continue to have the same opportunity to voice their opinions on boundary changes during public hearings held by the commissions, as the parliamentary secretary said earlier.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640705">The updates to the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act follow recommendations made in the past by the procedure and House affairs committee, the Chief Electoral Officer and the Lortie Commission of 1991.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640706">Since the fair representation act was introduced, many of my constituents have rightly demanded to know how much the new seats in Parliament will cost. I will be clear in stating that the annual cost per MP are estimated at approximately $642,000, for a total of $19,281,00 for the 30 new MPs. During each election, there will be a cost of approximately $505,800 per new riding.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640707">Yes, there is an additional investment to be made, and at the end of the day our government's first and top priority is the economy. We remain focused on the mandate that Canadians have given us to secure the economic recovery through a low tax plan for jobs and economic growth.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2640708">However, maintaining fair representation costs money and I will not be apologetic over these costs and the benefits they provide Canadians, because this is the cost of democracy and ensuring that all Canadians benefit fairly and uniformly. If nothing is done, Canadians living in the fastest growing provinces will only become more and more under-represented under the status quo. Clearly, this is not fair.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640709">Every Canadian's vote, to the greatest extent possible, should carry equal weight. In my own riding of Etobicoke Centre, along with my colleagues in the greater Toronto area, the need for Bill <Document DbId="5194714" Type="3">C-20</Document> could not be greater. Having effective representation is a necessary requirement for a healthy democracy and to ensure the voices of Canadians are heard by their elected officials.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640710">It also enables parliamentarians to effectively serve the people who sent us to the chamber on their behalf. Without Bill <Document DbId="5194714" Type="3">C-20</Document>, this would become increasingly difficult to achieve.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640711">As I mentioned earlier, urban Canadians are under-represented. This has serious consequences. In Etobicoke Centre, for example, my office deals with an enormous number of immigration case files, social security issues, employment insurance, passport requests and many other government services. By increasing the number of seats in urban areas, Canadians will be better served. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2640712">Like all members of Parliament, I have a modest budget and staff to fulfill these responsibilities. Although Bill <Document DbId="5194714" Type="3">C-20</Document> comes with a fiduciary commitment, this is money well spent and well regulated. By increasing the number of seats in Ontario, our government is ensuring that Canadian voices are heard and that they are served by their elected officials, as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640713">The updated seat allocation formula contained in the fair representation act moves every province toward representation by population. It is a fair, reasonable and principled solution that addresses the unacceptable under-representation of some provinces and fulfills our government's long-standing commitment to move toward fair representation. This bill would ensure that the vote of each Canadian, to the greatest extent possible, has equal weight. It keeps our three commitments to Canadians and delivers fairness.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

He talks about representation by population. The United States has over 300 million people and I think it is represented by about 660 representatives in the Senate, the House of Representatives and their executive. If we go by its theory, if we have 300 million people in Canada, is the member saying that we should have over 3,000 members of Parliament?</ParaText><ParaText id="2640716">I would remind the hon. member, for whom I have great respect, that ever since the debate started I have not received one email, phone call, letter or fax, and have not been stopped once in the mall or at a store where people were saying “Please, Peter, please give us more members of Parliament. This is really what we want.”</ParaText><ParaText id="2640717">However, I will not argue the point. The member says that some ridings are disjointed. There is no question about that. When a riding in Prince Edward Island has 39,000 people and another one has 170,000 people, that is incorrect and it needs to be fixed. The member is absolutely correct.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2640718">However, to really fix this problem there are two flies in your ointment of the argument that you are presenting. One is that historically, when Canada came together, Quebec was assured a certain percentage of the seats in Canada. This bill would diminish Quebec's standing in Canada, as well as Atlantic Canada's standing. When we look at the percentages—</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It is Friday morning and everyone wants to speak on this important piece of nation building, which is what it is.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640740">We have rural ridings that are large geographic areas that currently are struggling to gain access to their member of Parliament. We have large northern ridings that span the size of the United Kingdom. We have, of course, fast growing suburban ridings and more and more densely populated urban ridings. </ParaText><ParaText id="2640741">In other words, we cannot accurately and fairly redistribute the seats just by looking at lines on a ledger. That is not what nation building is about. Nation building is about listening to the different voices in our country, listening to and responding to the different needs, realities, struggles, and hopes of the various regions in our country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2640742">Oftentimes we say there are several different regions, but within those regions there are other regions. I would argue that the rural-urban dichotomy is one which we really need to think about and research, and thoughtfully proceed with more fair and balanced representation in this place on the basis of not just population numbers. </ParaText><ParaText id="2640743">On our side of the House, we agree that these fast growing provinces need better representation. However, we on this side of the House also acknowledge and believe that the weight that Quebec currently holds in this place should be maintained. We believe those things. This bill does not achieve any of that. It does not go far enough for Ontario, Alberta or British Columbia, and it certainly does not go far enough for Quebec.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640744">The government likes to bring in the bean-counters and we cannot build a nation with bean-counters. That is not how we have ever done that in this country. This is a living, breathing thing, and we need to respond to the realities of this country in a similar fashion. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2640745">In this current Parliament, we have seen the government run roughshod, essentially, over democracy in this place. We have seen it invoke time allocation nine times. Now we hear the Conservatives talk about how it is important for Canadians to have their voices heard in the House of Commons when at every opportunity they try to curtail that voice from actually being expressed here. </ParaText><ParaText id="2640746">The Conservative members often talk about having discussed these bills ad nauseam and it being time to pass them. Meanwhile, we have 50-60-65-70 new members in the House of Commons. I think that the communities that these new members represent would like to have their voices heard in this place. We need to set this bill in the context of the government's propensity, whenever it feels it is in its favour, to run roughshod over parliamentary democracy.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640747">We have several different, sometimes competing, interests. It is incumbent upon us as parliamentarians and it is incumbent upon the government, if it chooses to take that responsibility, to actually try to balance all of these concerns and to move forward in a way that builds this nation. The Conservative government likes to pit groups against each other. We saw that very early on when it tried to pit young workers against older workers in the lockout of CUPW workers.</ParaText>

That is not what we are here to do.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640749">We are here to bring people together, so that we create winners in this country, not some winners and some losers. That is what we on this side of the House believe in. That is why this bill does not go nearly far enough. It does not go far enough at all.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640750">One of my colleagues opposite has said that Canadians deserve to have representation that is fair and balanced. We agree that Canadians do deserve that.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640751">However, we have a system of first past the post, which has created a scenario where, on the government side, 39% of Canadians voted for the government and, on this side, 61% of Canadians voted for other parties. </ParaText><ParaText id="2640752">When we are talking about how we are going to fix the democratic deficit in this country, certainly the conversations that Canadians are having, and I think the hon. member opposite would agree, are more about the issues and distortions that first past the post create in our country than they are about the redistribution of seats.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2640753">We have several questions before us. The Senate is another example. I do not see many people in this country storming my office, pleading with me to advocate on behalf of Senate reform. They are wondering why we are spending $100 million on a non-elected Senate that actually shuts down bills that this democratically elected House passes. That is shameful. That is why more and more Canadians question the validity of the Senate; that is not to question the validity of those good senators who do some good work. We are talking about the institution here.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640754">We have significant issues before us. The reason that we are here is to advocate for fair representation. We have no disagreement that there are some issues that need to be solved here. There is no question about it.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640755">Fast growing provinces are not accurately represented here. There is no question about it. However, at the same time, we as a country have passed a unanimous motion that the Québécois form a nation in a united Canada. It is incumbent upon us to maintain the weight that Quebec has in this House. </ParaText><ParaText id="2640756">We need to move beyond the divide and conquest approaches of the government to actually truly fix the democratic deficit in this country, which certainly includes seat redistribution, but it also includes a real examination of our electoral system and first past the post.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

What the bill addresses is the serious and increasing under-representation of our fastest growing provinces, especially Ontario. </ParaText><ParaText id="2640769">This under-representation is a serious problem that requires an immediate solution. Something must be done. This problem is only going to get worse if we keep the status quo. Happily, we have a solution to fix this problem and a government that is interested in fixing it, not just using the problem to score political points. </ParaText><ParaText id="2640770">Our government is committed to addressing this problem with the fair representation act. <Document DbId="5194714" Type="3">Bill C-20</Document> provides a principled update to the formula allocating House of Commons seats that is fair for all provinces. This is an important point. Increasing representation for the faster growing provinces should not be done at the cost of pitting region against region, or Canadian against Canadian. What we have seen from the opposition parties on this issue is quite the opposite. Their proposals, both in their own way, compromise the democratic representation of some Canadians in the name of making political statements. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2640771">The NDP, on the one hand, would guarantee a province a fixed percentage of seats in the House regardless of its share of the population. That is not in keeping with our formula that moves all provinces closer to representation by population. The fact is the NDP proposal would introduce a new factor that would cause further under-representation of the faster growing provinces, like Ontario, provinces that we need to treat more fairly. The change proposed by the NDP is not something this House and our Parliament can do on its own. </ParaText><ParaText id="2640772">The Liberals, on the other hand, present a proposal that would be a recipe for provincial anger and conflict. The Liberals propose taking seats away from the smaller, slower growing provinces and giving those seats to the larger, faster growing provinces. </ParaText><ParaText id="2640773">We make no apologies for addressing the significant and increasing under-representation of ordinary Canadians. Our bill does that, just as we promised it would. We also make no apologies for believing that this problem should not be fixed by inflicting seat losses on other provinces. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2640774">Just as we are ensuring that no province can move from being overrepresented to under-represented as a result of this formula, we are also ensuring that no province would lose seats through this formula. That is why we made three distinct promises on House of Commons representation in the last election to ensure that any update to the formula would be fair for all Canadians in all provinces. First, we said we would increase the number of seats now and in the future to better reflect population growth in places like British Columbia, my home province of Ontario, and Alberta. Second, we would protect the number of seats for smaller provinces. Third, we would protect the proportional representation of Quebec according to its population. </ParaText><ParaText id="2640775">We would have to move away from those promises in order to implement either of the opposition parties' proposals. We are not going to do that. </ParaText><ParaText id="2640776">Our government received a very strong mandate in the last federal election to deliver on the commitments we made, and we are doing exactly that with the fair representation act. It is important that these three commitments be taken together. When taken together, the update to the formula allocating House of Commons seats would be fair across the country. The practical result of <Document DbId="5194714" Type="3">Bill C-20</Document> is that every single Canadian moves closer to representation by population. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2640777">Our first commitment is the importance of introducing a seat allocation formula that is more responsive to population size and trends. This legislation would move the House closer to fair representation for Canadians living in Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta, while maintaining the number of seats for slower growing provinces, and ensuring Quebec's representation is equal to its population. By introducing a seat allocation formula that is more responsive to population size and trends, the fair representation act would move the House closer to representation by population both now and well into the future. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2640778">The practical effect is that Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta would be entitled to new seats under the <Document DbId="5194714" Type="3">fair representation act</Document>. Ontario, with the largest population, would receive 15 new seats. Historically, we have always been under-represented in the House. I believe my residents deserve equal voice in the House. Alberta would receive six new seats rather than only three. British Columbia would receive six new seats rather than only one. Quebec's representation which will equal its population means that it will receive three new seats. </ParaText><ParaText id="2640779">This is the best formula to move all provinces toward representation by population in a principled manner. This fair representation would have a direct effect on my riding in Mississauga and on the greater Toronto area as a whole. Canadians, especially new Canadians and visible minorities, would be much more fairly represented than they are now. Ontario residents are entitled to fair representation, and the populations of our ridings would be much more manageable.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640780">Our second commitment is that the government will address under-representation in a way that respects the representation of smaller provinces. This is a long-standing commitment of our government and our party. Canadians have given us a strong mandate to deliver in this regard.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2640781">The <Document DbId="5194714" Type="3">fair representation act</Document> is fair for all Canadians, not just for some provinces. It is a measured investment that brings every single Canadian closer to representation by population. We have committed to protect the seat counts of the smaller provinces and we will keep that promise.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640782">Finally, our third commitment under the <Document DbId="5194714" Type="3">fair representation act</Document> also provides that the seat allocation formula would apply a representation rule. If a province becomes under-represented as a result of the application of the updated formula, additional seats would be allocated to that province so that its representation would equal its share of the population. Based on population estimates, Quebec would be the first province to receive new seats in order not to become under-represented by the application of the updated formula.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640783">Quebec has 23% of the provincial population and will have 23% of the provincial seats in the House of Commons. My colleagues have said that before and I will repeat that again. Quebec would be fairly represented under this bill. That said, the representation rule is nationally applicable and applies equally to every single province in the country that enters the scenario.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640784">This representation rule is a principled measure that ensures smaller and low-growth provinces would not become under-represented in the future. They would maintain representation that is in line with their share of the population. That is fair as well.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2640785">In conclusion, this bill, the <Document DbId="5194714" Type="3">fair representation act</Document>, is the best formula to address the under-representation of Canadians living in Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia without causing undue conflict. It is reasonable. It is principled. It is nationally applicable. Most importantly, it is fair to all Canadians. It will achieve better representation for Canadians living in faster growing provinces while maintaining representation for smaller and slower growing provinces. It is eminently more fair for Ontario. It brings every single Canadian closer to representation by population. It delivers on our government's long-standing commitment to move toward fair representation in the House of Commons.</ParaText><ParaText id="2640786">The <Document DbId="5194714" Type="3">fair representation act</Document> is principled and reasonable legislation that needs to be passed as quickly as possible. I encourage the opposition to work with us on this important piece of legislation for Ontario and for all Canadians.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

In order to emphasize the inconsistency of Bill C-20, the bill presented today by the government, I would like to focus on a case that has not been discussed very much to this point, and that is the case of Prince Edward Island.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641089">Four of the 308 members of the House currently represent Prince Edward Island, when really the province should have just one representative. If we can abandon the purely mathematical approach that would have us divide the number of inhabitants by an electoral quotient in the specific case of Prince Edward Island, why can we not do the same for Quebec? </ParaText><ParaText id="2641090">If this dead-simple and rather mean mathematical approach that would have us divide the population by an electoral quotient were used, the entire province of Prince Edward Island would have only one member of Parliament. The principle that we have accepted is the result of the Senate floor clause—one of the clauses that allows a province to have a different number of representatives than it would if the number were determined based solely on mathematical calculations—and it must also be applied to other specific cases. Quebec is one of them since Quebeckers are one of the three founding peoples of Canada. If we want to respect the spirit that prevailed when Canada was created, Quebec must be allowed to maintain its political weight in the House.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2641091">Prince Edward Island has a population of 135,000 people, and it has four members of Parliament. Some ridings in provinces like Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta have 125,000 constituents. When we compare these numbers, we see that, on one hand, we have 125,000 constituents being represented by one member and, on the other, we have 135,000 constituents being represented by four members. This is not a purely mathematical calculation. On the contrary, in keeping with the spirit that prevailed when Canada was created, this country's culture includes the principle of fair representation, not just in the mathematical sense but also in terms of economic, geographic and historic realities.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641092">If we accept the Senate floor clause—even though the NDP is far from a strong supporter of a Canadian Senate—we must keep in mind that Canada is a very big country with historic, geographic and social specificities, since it has more than one founding people. We must therefore not apply a purely mathematical approach. To my knowledge, when the Conservative government introduced this bill, it never questioned the over-representation of Prince Edward Island. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2641093">There is a well-known saying that what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. Either we are consistent and apply a mathematical formula, in which case Prince Edward Island would have only one member, or we accept the fact that representation will not be purely mathematical, but will have some significance, in which case special dispensation must be applied.</ParaText>

This gives P.E.I. a floor of four members of Parliament because it has four senators.

In fact, it is one of the principles that this country was founded upon. </ParaText><ParaText id="2641114">In researching the debates leading to the British North America Act and the formation of Upper and Lower Canada with New Brunswick and Nova Scotia in 1867, members would know that the Fathers of Confederation insisted that the House of Commons would be based on the concept of representation by population; that all Canadian citizens in the new country of Canada would have an equal voice in electing members to this chamber and an equal voice in the affairs of their nation; and that their members would, within reasonable limits, represent the same number of people.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641115">Those principles that our country and Constitution are based on are as valid today as they were in 1867, so it will come as no surprise to the members of the House that I support Bill <Document DbId="5194714" Type="3">C-20</Document> and congratulate the <Affiliation DbId="170707" Type="4">Minister of State (Democratic Reform)</Affiliation> for introducing this legislation. In my view, it will remedy some of the current deficiencies in representation in this chamber.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2641116">This legislation, as members of the House know, does not dictate the number of seats that each province would get; rather, it sets a formula and changes the formula that determines the representation in this House.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641117">Several provinces in our Confederation are growing much more quickly than others. I happen to represent an electoral district in one of those faster-growing provinces, the province of Alberta. The other faster-growing provinces are British Columbia, where you, Madam Speaker, are a representative, and Ontario.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641118">On representation by population, I think we can agree on two things: that it is a principle that ought to be adhered to to the greatest extent possible, and that true and perfect representation by population is impracticable in a country as diverse as Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="2641119">Simply stated, on the one hand we have too many densely populated areas. Around the GTA, for example, Mississauga, Brampton and other suburbs are densely populated and growing arithmetically. Conversely, we have very sparsely populated parts of our country: the Arctic, the Northwest Territories, Yukon, even northern Alberta. Driving an hour north of my riding of Edmonton—St. Albert, one begins to enter the sparsely populated parts of our province. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2641120">We will never have perfect rep by pop because there has to be some accommodation for the less densely populated areas to be represented. Of course those provinces and territories are entitled to representation, and they require and deserve a voice on national issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641121">Over time, representation in this place has been modified by a number of formulas, each superimposed upon the other, and we have talked about them today. There is the Senate floor clause, I think from around 1915, which guaranteed that no province could have fewer seats in the lower chamber than it had in the upper chamber. Then there is the 1985 grandfather clause, which dictates that no province could have fewer seats than it had at that time. We have a number of rules superimposed upon each other, and those rules, coupled with the fact that some provinces, including mine, are growing very quickly have led to the current disproportion.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641122">It is a significant disproportion. According to the Mowat Centre, 61% of Canadians are currently under-represented in this chamber. Worse, visible minorities in visible minority communities are particularly under-represented. That is because they tend to reside in under-represented densely populated urban areas, largely but not exclusively in the Greater Toronto Area of Ontario. </ParaText><ParaText id="2641123">I was speaking with my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170567" Type="2">Brampton West</Affiliation> after question period.

This creates some really distinct problems when we try to represent both that number of people and that number of visible minorities. </ParaText><ParaText id="2641126">As I know from representing the good people of <Affiliation DbId="170123" Type="2">Edmonton—St. Albert</Affiliation>, the majority of what we refer to as “casework” is immigration work on behalf of individuals attempting to get visas for their relatives or to expedite their path to citizenship. I represent a relatively homogenous riding in Alberta, but casework still takes up probably close to 70% of the files that come to my office from constituents needing my assistance, so I cannot imagine the workload for a member like the member for <Affiliation DbId="170567" Type="2">Brampton West</Affiliation>, who represents, according to him, 200,000 people, half of whom are visible minorities.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641127">The bill tends to remedy those deficiencies by working toward representation by population, although admittedly not achieving it in any perfect form.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2641128">Under the new formula, the calculation would give Ontario 15 additional seats, British Columbia six additional seats and my province, Alberta, six additional seats. Because of Quebec's unique status within Confederation, Quebec would be provided with three additional seats to allow its representation to be comparable to what it is currently. </ParaText><ParaText id="2641129">This is a great attempt at moving toward representation by population.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641130">I want to share an anecdote, because I have some experience in this matter. </ParaText><ParaText id="2641131">I know the members of the Liberal Party are advocating that provinces such as mine be awarded extra seats but that the size of the House not be increased. We were faced with a very similar problem in Alberta about eight years ago, when I was the MLA for Edmonton-Calder. We had a comparable situation in that the city of Calgary was growing very quickly; the city of Edmonton was growing, but slowly; and rural Alberta was either staying constant or, in some parts, actually getting smaller. As a result, the people of Calgary were under-represented in the provincial legislature, and we had to wrestle with this very same issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641132">Ultimately the decision we made was similar to what the Liberals are currently proposing federally: the provincial legislature would stay at 83 seats, but to accommodate that, we would take two seats away from rural Alberta and one away from Edmonton and give those three seats to Calgary. I know the member for <Affiliation DbId="170625" Type="2">Crowfoot</Affiliation> remembers that situation. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2641133">The outcry, which ought to have been predictable, was loud. The citizens of Edmonton would not and did not accept that one of their members of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta would be taken out of play and that they would have one less representative. They felt disenfranchised. </ParaText><ParaText id="2641134">They spoke loudly, first through letters to the editor. Editorialists wrote that the MLAs for Edmonton were not standing up for Edmonton. They subsequently spoke in the next election about their dissatisfaction. Of course, that was not the only issue, but they were certainly dissatisfied with the loss of a member of the legislature.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641135">I say to my friends opposite who advocate keeping this House at the same size by reducing the number of members from certain provinces that the citizens of those provinces will not accept it. They will argue, and argue correctly, that they have been disenfranchised, that they have lost membership in this House and that they care about representation. They will be upset.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641136">This formula, which expands this House marginally, would allow for more representation for faster-growing provinces such as mine, Ontario and British Columbia, but it would not take away seats from any province. Therefore, it is a good compromise and a step toward representation by population, which is a fundamental concept of our democracy and needs to be preserved.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

MPs and their teams work to build communities and bring communities together. </ParaText><ParaText id="2641155">Moving forward with this seat redistribution bill, we need to ensure that, when the constituencies are broken up, it is done along community lines and that communities are not divided because we need to ensure that we are helping them thrive rather than causing further division within them.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641156">The process of seat distribution should really be an opportunity and an exercise in nation building. It is essential to ensure that each province has the number of seats it is entitled to based on not only its population but also on the principle of proportionate representation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2641157">It is also essential that Quebec, having been unanimously declared a nation within Canada, maintain its current weight in the House, which is historically accurate to the time that our Constitution was written. Unfortunately, that is another area where the bill falls short. The bill would do nothing to protect Quebec and its weight in the House. In fact, the bill would reduce Quebec's weight. It also has no safeguards to ensure that Quebec's weight does not continue to diminish moving forward. This lack of protection is not unique for Quebec only but for all other provinces and territories at well.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2641158">I will use Prince Edward Island as an example. It currently has four seats for an Island with the population of almost 141,000 people. That is just 10,000 more people than in my one constituency alone, which is divided into four seats. We need to ensure that these seats and the type of representation that Prince Edward Island has is protected moving forward. The system was set up by the Fathers of Confederation to ensure that the people of our country are represented adequately and well. If Prince Edward Island is working, then we need to move toward a system that ensures that our members of Parliament have the opportunity to meet with their constituents and ensure that we are able to provide the type of representation and service for our communities that the communities in Prince Edward Island get. We need to ensure that we are able to have those conversations with our constituents.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641159">I will now talk about the other areas in the country that would be diminished.

We need to ensure that we are having conversations with the provinces and territories so that they receive the number of seats they are entitled to. Unfortunately, this bill would still leave the provinces and territories under-represented and would not redistribute seats to the provinces that are most populated. We need to do this in a way that allows for proper consultation with the provinces and territories, which has yet to happen. We need to ensure that the provinces and territories have a buy-in to the plan. At the moment, there has been little commitment to this plan by the premiers of the provinces and territories.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641161">If the government is serious about proper representation in the House of Commons, I will make some suggestions about what it should do.

							<ParaText id="2641162">The New Democrats are very supportive of seat redistribution. In fact, we were the first party to introduce a bill on this very topic. The difference is that our bill gave additional seats to the fastest growing provinces and Quebec to ensure that the historic weight was maintained.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641163">At the end of the day, we need to use this process of seat redistribution as a nation building exercise. Sir John A. Macdonald, our former prime minister, who was also a Conservative member, was a nation builder, but the current Conservative government is not even living up to its own party's history and is deteriorating the legacy of our Fathers of Confederation. This process needs to bring us together as Canadians and not rip apart our nation and communities or pit region against region. We must consult with the provinces and Canadians and ask whether this bill would do enough to achieve better representation by population while, at the same time, building a stronger Canada. In my opinion, this bill would not.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2641164">At the end of the day, Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta would remain under-represented in the House. I will throw out some numbers with respect to the proposed new seats in this bill. We would see the percentage of representation in the House diminish and be less than the actual percentage of the population in all four provinces. The projected percentage of population for Ontario, for instance, is 38.91%, whereas the percentage in the House would be 36.12%. Quebec would go down from its historic weight in the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641165">This really needs to be an exercise in nation building. Nation building is about true fair representation that is inclusive of all in the country. If we are going to do an exercise in nation building, we need to ensure that the House represents all Canadians. That means ensuring there are more women in the House who represent 52% of our population, more aboriginal people, more newer immigrant communities being represented, more youth and more persons with disabilities. </ParaText><ParaText id="2641166">I will end my remarks in saying that our former leader, Jack Layton, a great parliamentarian and member of Parliament, lived to build this nation and unite this country. That is what we all need to be doing, working to bring this country together and strengthen it, not to be pitting region against region and diminishing the quality of representation in the House.

Members have the numbers on how many seats will go to which provinces.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641169">Where is the NDP plan? Where are the numbers? Why do the NDP members not talk about the number of seats they are proposing? I did not hear any numbers in her speech.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641170">Does she realize that the NDP plan would require a constitutional change? Is the NDP proposing that we get into long drawn-out constitutional battles? I would like to know that from the member.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641171">The member says she wants to talk about the bill more and have more consultation. We have debated the bill in the House quite a bit. I do not know if she realizes, but maybe she could make it clear, that we have a deadline coming up in February. If the member wants Canadians to have fair representation at the next voting opportunity, does she not think we should move forward and vote on the bill?

We have been talking about numbers. We are saying that we should ensure there is proper representation based on the percentage of Canadians within the areas. That needs to be done in consultation with the provinces. We need to ensure that we maintain the historic representation of parts of the nation.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641173">The second question was about the debate on the bill and the fact that the government wants to hurry this process through. Proper representation is about the elected members to the House having the opportunity to debate bills. Once again the government has moved to stop debate. It is trying to not allow us, as elected representations, me as an elected representative of over 130,000 people, to debate. The government is trying to silence the voices of more than 130,000 people and many more.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641174"> Many of our members on this side of the House would like to have an opportunity to debate.

However, the Conservatives talking about a democratic deficit is like me saying I do not like donuts. The Conservative Party is the most anti-democratic party I have witnessed in my 14 and a half years here.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641184">We had legislation, passed by a majority of the House of Commons, and sent to an unelected body of party principals, I guess that is the most polite way to say it. What happened? The Senate killed the bill without a word of debate. Yet what do the Conservatives want to do for democratic reform? They want to add more seats. </ParaText><ParaText id="2641185">Let us follow the logic of the <Affiliation DbId="170707" Type="4">Minister of State for Democratic Reform</Affiliation> and his Conservative Party. He says that because B.C., Alberta and Ontario have more people now, they need more seats. Of 34 million people, they want to add another 30 MPs. The United States has over 300 million people and it has 650 or 670 representatives. If we follow his logic, if we had over 300 million people, there would be over 3,000 of us in this place. I do not know how big his apartment is, but he would not have a place to stay. That is problem one in their logic.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2641186">Problem two is this. The minister, in his question for my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170390" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation>, said that if we were to do anything else, we would have to open up the Constitution for debate. Bring it on. The only way we can have true democratic representation in the House of Commons is to have debate with the provinces and territories. </ParaText><ParaText id="2641187">This is the lazy person's way of doing it. The Conservatives just looked at the three provinces and said that since they had more of a population, they should have more seats. Also, they want to hurry the bill because they claim that if we do not, we will not get it done in time for the Elections Canada people need to redistribute the ridings and everything else that goes with that. Why is this all of a sudden the most pressing issue facing our country, to put 30 more politicians in the House of Commons? </ParaText><ParaText id="2641188">I have great respect for the <Affiliation DbId="170707" Type="4">Minister of State for Democratic Reform</Affiliation>. However, I have yet to get one email, one phone call, one letter, one fax or one comment anyone in a store or mall telling me that we should increase the number of members of Parliament in the House of Commons.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2641189">The government is correct though. When some MPs represent 39,000 people and others represent 150,000 people, that is wrong. That is an imbalance and it needs to be fixed. However, this bill does not fix it. Therefore, why not have true nation building?</ParaText><ParaText id="2641190">In a great room just across the hall, there is a great picture of the Fathers of Confederation. There was a good man once, Sir John A. Macdonald. He participated in nation building. The Conservative government is not nation building; it is dividing the country. </ParaText><ParaText id="2641191">Atlantic Canada will lose its weight of representation, as will Quebec, rural Canada and the north. The bill does nothing to bring more women to politics. It does nothing to bring more aboriginal people to politics. This does nothing for people with disabilities, the youth, or new immigrants. </ParaText><ParaText id="2641192">The face of Canada is changing quite rapidly. The bill does not address any of those issues. All it does is recognize that three provinces have more people, so they should have more seats and we have to do it right away. </ParaText><ParaText id="2641193">If the Conservatives truly want to nation-build, let us talk to the provinces, the municipalities and Canadians about what they think is fair representation. We in the NDP have two words that will really help our country: proportional representation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2641194">We should think about this. The Green Party of Canada, with great respect to it, gets 4% or 5% of the national vote and gets one seat. The Conservative Party gets 38% of the vote, 55% of the seats, but has 100% of the power. Yet 62% of the voting people said “no” to that agenda. Therefore, what we have is a stable opposition majority.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641195"> I remember very clearly certain members sitting in the House complaining about the Liberals when they only received 36% of the national vote. They had 177 seats, but 100% of the power. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2641196">However, we do not have to play those games. We do not have to divide and conquer or pick winners and losers. Everybody in Canada should win with fair representation and with proportional representation. We are one of the few western democracies without proportional representation.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641197"> The first past the post system is a failure. This is why so many Canadians refuse to exercise their most democratic right. The Conservatives can put 30 or 100 more MPs in here and they will not increase the voter turnout in our country. The way to do it is through proportional representation, to encourage all Canadians, whether they vote the Green Party in Charlottetown, or the NDP in B.C., or Conservative in Saskatchewan, or the Bloc Québécois in Quebec or whatever, to vote and know that their vote actually matters, that their vote will have a say in the general overall numbers. Right now, it does not.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2641198">If the Conservatives want true nation-building, open up the entire discussion. This is a small, stop-gap measure. That is all it is. They have missed the opportunity, but it is not too late. There is no rush here. Canadians are not storming the Bastille saying that they need to have this by Christmas. I do not even think many people in the minister's riding are storming his office saying that he has to drop everything, that he should forget about food banks, homeless people, unemployed workers, businesses, the environment, that this is the number one issue facing Canadians. It is simply nonsense. We have lots of time for nation-building, but the only way we will to do it is if we co-operate with the provinces, municipalities, aboriginal groups and the territories to truly make the House of Commons what it should be, a reflection of Canadian society. </ParaText><ParaText id="2641199">Why do we not have 50% representation of women in this place? The bill does not address that. Why do we have so few aboriginal people in this place?

If the government were prepared to do that, I think it would find willing participants in the Liberal Party, the Bloc, the NDP, the Green Party, whomever.

							<ParaText id="2641205">Why do we not do it right? Why do we not get rid of the first past the post system, bring in proportional representation, abolish the Senate.

The bill's focus is on working with partnerships to improve information and share information on screening with women and their doctors. Several current government actions are highlighted. They are supported by other partner organizations focused on cancer, breast cancer and breast cancer screening. I will explain more about these actions in my remarks today, but I would like to begin with a few words about how critical the underlying issue is.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2641262">Every year, millions of Canadians are affected by cancer either personally or by the experience of a family member, friend or neighbour. I have personally been affected by this disease with the loss of my mother in 1989. Because of this and my role as a surgeon, I know about the importance of breast cancer screening and awareness. Breast health, regular checkups and exams should be a conversation in every home in Canada. It is one that occurred in my family home. As one can imagine, it is not an easy conversation for a single father who has recently lost his wife to have with his young children. However, it is extremely important that parents have this conversation with all of their daughters.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641263">Awareness starts at home, as well as in a doctor's office. Young women across the country should be in constant dialogue with family physicians when it comes to their breast health and determining what practices for screening are best for them. Breast cancer in particular is a major health concern. One in nine women in Canada develops breast cancer during her lifetime, making it one of the most common cancers affecting Canadian women.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2641264">In 2011, it is estimated that 23,400 women in Canada will be diagnosed with breast cancer, an increase from 2010. That represents about 450 women being diagnosed each week. Early detection of breast cancer through organized screening programs is an important public health practice.

Our government works across different health sectors with partner organizations, as well as with provinces and territories that deliver health care services.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641265">Together we want to improve screening and early detection and to provide information to women. That is exactly what Bill <Document DbId="5142292" Type="4">C-314</Document> calls for: an assurance that we are doing all we can to increase awareness and to assist health care providers and women in making well-informed screening decisions. </ParaText><ParaText id="2641266">This bill recognizes that we are taking action on this issue through a number of initiatives. We are reinforcing existing investments, commitments and action on prevention, detection and control. The bill also recognizes the important work done by the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer. This initiative was established and funded by our government. The bill highlights the work our government does through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Canadian breast cancer screening initiative. The knowledge generated through these initiatives is then shared with doctors and networks that include health organizations like the Canadian Cancer Society.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2641267">The central initiative supported by our government to fight cancer is the Canadian strategy for cancer control. This is a co-ordinated comprehensive strategy developed with government, non-governmental cancer organizations, cancer survivors, researchers and health care professionals. Screening and early detection is the main priority of the strategy. Breast density and its implications for screening is a part of this. </ParaText><ParaText id="2641268">The Canadian strategy for cancer control is implemented by the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer. The partnership is an independent not-for-profit organization that is working on prevention, early detection, treatment and the support for Canadians living with cancer. This organization has done much to ensure cancer patients and health care professionals across Canada have state-of-the-art knowledge about what works to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641269">Notably, the partnership has encouraged hard-to-reach populations to undergo screening, helping doctors to identify cancer earlier. Funding of $250 million to the partnership was recently renewed for five more years, from 2012 to 2017. This funding will help the partnership continue its invaluable work on reducing cancer cases, enhancing the quality of life of cancer patients and increasing the likelihood of survival.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2641270">Through CIHR, the government is funding research on more effective diagnostics, treatment and prevention for all cancers, including breast cancer. Research investments in this area support important Canadian scientific work. I want to stress that the search for a cure is only part of the incredible research being undertaken in this country.

This work facilitates action on breast cancer, women's health, inter-sectoral collaborations, and stakeholder involvement.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641273">The government supports the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation's screening initiative, a key component of the Canadian breast cancer initiative. The screening initiative is a joint provincial-territorial collaboration to develop screening approaches. It contributes to improving breast cancer screening programs by developing nationally agreed upon quality indicators.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641274">For women with higher breast density, breast cancer is generally harder to detect using mammograms, resulting in more frequent screenings. The Canadian breast cancer screening initiative supports national standards for prevention, early detection and screening. It seeks to develop and share best practices in breast cancer and women's health. Our government recognizes the importance of participating in cancer screening. Raising awareness around breast density supports this goal.</ParaText>

So we as Liberals support any effort to increase awareness, to fund research, and to provide information to Canadians about cancer prevention and early detection. We know that we should be doing more of this in many areas of health, including health promotion, wait times and pharmaceutical strategies. </ParaText><ParaText id="2641284">The proposed legislation calls on the federal government to work with the provincial and territorial governments to increase awareness among women about the risk factor involved in having dense breast tissue. It asks that we use existing programs. It asks that we identify the gaps in information for women and that we improve that information that is going to Canadian women. It asks that we address the challenges in detecting breast cancer in women with dense breast tissue. </ParaText>

As the <Affiliation DbId="170869" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Labour</Affiliation> has said, all of us are touched by breast cancer in some way. My mother died of breast cancer as well. She had two different breast cancers that took her life even in what was to be a lesser kind of breast cancer: breast cancer after menopause. My sister has had breast cancer diagnosed before menopause.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641286"> As a physician, I recognize the importance of early detection and ensuring that patients have the best possible information and treatment. Any oncologist would say very clearly he or she would rather find these cancers early when indeed they can be treated. The problem is the dense breast tissue makes it difficult to identify breast cancer. There are too many stories of what was presumed to be a negative mammogram that was later on shown to have a cancer hiding in the breast tissue that was not visible to the radiologist at the time.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2641287">We are blessed now in Canada that almost 80% of mammography is done with the new digital approach which makes it much easier to detect the problems in dense breast tissue, but still we need to do more. We need to require more tests and appropriate screening. It means that we need to ensure that people reading the mammography are experienced radiologists. Now with technology, help is possible for very experienced people with tremendous expertise in mammography can read them at a distance. The new machine in Moose Factory allows the people a long way away to be the actual expert reading the exams.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641288">We always have to balance appropriate testing without alarming the general population or Canadians with unnecessary tests that only put more pressure on the system. We believe that the federal government does have a role to play in facilitating best practices and funding research related to cancer prevention and early detection as part of the Canadian partnership against cancer.</ParaText>

But is also interesting that the California governor, Jerry Brown, vetoed the bill noting that while it was important, the bill should have used more careful language so as not to create unnecessary anxiety among women and strain the health system.

We know that breast cancer is far too common in Canada. This year, some 23,000 Canadian women will be diagnosed with breast cancer, a one in nine chance over a lifetime, and breast cancer will claim the lives of 5,100 women this year alone.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641299">We know that breast cancer screening saves lives. We also know that women with denser breast tissue face added challenges with cancer detection through mammography. Targeting dense tissue, as the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170139" Type="2">Barrie</Affiliation> attests, is one tangible way we can make a difference. We can play an effective role in the adoption of effective, efficient early detection practices in screening. That is why we are raising awareness and providing accurate information about screening. This helps women make better decisions, particularly if they have dense breast tissue. </ParaText><ParaText id="2641300">Bill <Document DbId="5142292" Type="4">C-314</Document> focuses on the efforts already under way to raise women's awareness about dense breast tissue and breast cancer screening. It also would help women and their doctors make well-informed decisions regarding their screening.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2641301"> There are a number of elements in the bill that I will outline, along with current federal initiatives that support this bill. First, the bill requires our government to determine if there are breast density information gaps in relation to breast cancer screening. By knowing where these gaps are, we can plug the holes through research. In response to the first element, our government will continue supporting cancer research through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, or CIHR. A priority of CIHR's Institute of Cancer Research is early cancer detection. It is currently exploring partnership opportunities with the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation for early detection funding. This research will address breast cancer information gaps.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641302">Second, the bill would require that approaches be identified as needed to improve information for women. This would be done to address the challenges of detecting cancer in women with denser tissue and to raise awareness concerning these challenges. Bill <Document DbId="5142292" Type="4">C-314</Document> also recognizes the responsibility provinces and territories have for delivering these invaluable programs. For example, when mammography identifies dense breast tissue, these programs notify women to obtain further testing. In Ontario, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador and the Northwest Territories an annual recall system is in place for women identified with dense breast tissue. In other jurisdictions, follow-up is determined by the radiologist.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2641303">While breast screening programs are primarily a provincial and territorial responsibility, the federal government, through existing initiatives and partnerships, supports raising awareness of breast cancer screening and breast density. In response to this bill, the government will d continue to support provinces and territories in raising awareness of breast density and its screening implications through the Canadian breast cancer screening initiative. This initiative is a partnership between the Public Health Agency of Canada and provincial and territorial programs. Through it, we are working with provincial and territorial governments to measure screening program performance nationwide. This means that all jurisdictions regularly share screening program information: lessons learned, best practices, share challenges and mutual questions of importance. </ParaText><ParaText id="2641304">Part of the Canadian breast cancer screening initiative includes the Canadian breast cancer screening database, a national repository on breast cancer screening. Provinces and territories contribute to that database, which is then used to monitor and evaluate screening programs across Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641305">Bill <Document DbId="5142292" Type="4">C-314</Document> would require the existing Canadian breast cancer screening initiative to share information on dense tissue in relation to cancer screening and any follow-up procedures. The initiative makes a tool available to assist in decision making pertaining to breast cancer screening. In the future, the tool will include breast density information. Sharing information about ways to improve these programs ensures women receive the full benefits of early detection.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp>
							<ParaText id="2641306">I am pleased to note that our government will also begin discussions through the federal-provincial-territorial national committee for the Canadian breast cancer screening initiative regarding identification protocols for dense breast tissue. Through the committee, participating provincial and territorial screening programs are encouraged to share best practices on raising awareness of dense breast tissue.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641307">The committee also provides opportunities for provincial and territorial governments to collaborate on screening recommendations and approaches. The Canadian breast cancer screening initiative will also continue providing information on breast cancer screening through its biennial report. This information will help to enhance organized screening across Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="2641308">Moreover, our government continues to take action through the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, which leads the implementation of the Canadian strategy for cancer control. This made-in-Canada approach, consistent with the bill, has a key role in accelerating effective cancer prevention and control strategies. It also works with and engages the cancer community to provide Canadians with information on screening.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641309">Of interest, the partnership hosts a web based resource called, “Cancer View Canada”. This portal provides information to Canadians on cancer issues, including screening, and it draws on the expertise of partners.</ParaText>

Access, equipment and funding are the silver bullets that make the most difference in the lives of cancer patients.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641318">As I read the bill before us, I was searching for these targets but, I am saddened to say, I found none. It is not that Canada does not need a bill to help fight against breast cancer, it is that we need a better bill. There are real ways that the government can make a difference and Bill <Document DbId="5142292" Type="4">C-314</Document> shirks that responsibility.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641319">First, education and awareness are not enough to combat health care problems. I have seen again and again over the past six months how keen the government is to throw huge amounts of money at educational and awareness campaigns while ignoring the tangible systemic problems that need to be addressed.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2641320">Awareness is a first step, and I would never degrade the necessity of education, but what is a woman who discovers that she is at risk for breast cancer to do when she does not have access to a family doctor?</ParaText><ParaText id="2641321">I come from <Affiliation DbId="170390" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation>, an urban riding in the greater Toronto area. One would think that being in an urban centre, people would not have a problem in terms of access to doctors. However, from the day I was elected, I have heard constantly from my constituents that they do not have family doctors and cannot afford the time and money required to travel to a place where they can see a doctor or a specialist. With the state of public transit being what it is for my constituents, I cannot say that I blame them. I takes two hours one way to go downtown. Would hon. members travel hours and hours on public transit to go to the doctor's office? I know I would not.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641322">Unless the government is willing to back this awareness campaign with federal money aimed at providing women with dense breast tissue direct access to doctors and state of the art screening equipment, such as a digital MRI mammogram machine, then all the education and awareness in the world will not really help these women.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2641323">I have witnessed this trend again and again. A federal program will take one shallow step toward addressing the real problem and that is where it stops.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641324">This is a game of optics. The Conservatives want to give the appearance that they are taking action on health care issues, without actually doing anything.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641325">The women of Nunavut do not have a breast cancer screening program at all. This is urgent. This is something that we can do that will have real effect on women's lives.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641326">If the government is serious about preventing breast cancer, then the bill in our hands today would be, among other things, a comprehensive proposal to work with our provincial governments and territorial governments to create a breast cancer screening program in Nunavut. The women of Nunavut and other rural communities in the north are already at risk. They are farthest away from hospitals and are often some of the poorest in our country, as we have recently learned with the community of Attawapiskat and many others. It is utterly negligent for the government to deny them access to basic health care while providing, through the bill, education that says, rightly, that more women should be tested and more frequently. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2641327">I would ask the <Affiliation DbId="128707" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> to explain this hypocrisy to the House today and, if she cannot, then to commit to creating legislation that will ensure that Nunavut has equal access to essential health services, as it is their right to have. </ParaText><ParaText id="2641328">My colleagues and I are not alone in thinking that the bill is weak and ineffective. The Canadian Breast Cancer Network is the national link between all of Canada's breast cancer prevention organizations, including the Canadian Cancer Society, the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation and the Breast Cancer Foundation of Canada, and they do not believe that the bill does enough to enhance screening for women at risk of breast cancer.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2641329">I know that the government has a hard time listening to expert advice from those members of civil society who know better than it does, but I beg the government to take note of three major recommendations that the Canadian Breast Cancer Network is saying will make a real difference for Canadian women.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641330">First is new clinical screening machines, MRI digital mammogram machines, that are more routinely used on all women. We must invest in state-of-the-art technology to save cancer patients now. A government that can invest in fighter jets can surely afford the diagnostic machines that have been proven to save the lives of cancer patients. </ParaText><ParaText id="2641331">Second, screening for all women should begin at the age of 40. The government must fund a federal program to establish screening programs for women aged 40 to 49. It is proven that early detection is paramount with breast cancer, and that is why a program that gives women access to doctors and screening before the age of 50 is crucial.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641332">Third, the CBCN has identified that Nunavut must have a breast cancer screening program. We must work with the territorial government to fund this program to reach out to at-risk women instead of demanding that they travel out of territory to receive equal health care.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2641333">While the Canadian Cancer Society is, of course, eager for legislation aimed at preventing breast cancer, it has come out and said that this bill will not produce any tangible outcomes for breast cancer patients and their families.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641334">It is also important that we speak to the needs of families when we talk about cancer. </ParaText><ParaText id="2641335">Anyone who has had a family member with cancer, as I have, can tell us how important it is to be supported in the role of an informal caregiver. We do not have enough home care in any of our provinces or territories in Canada; when family members become ill, it almost always falls on their family and community to care for them. This has practical repercussions on people's lives. When I say “support”, I do not mean only emotional and spiritual support for the patient. Although the value of emotional support is unquantifiable in difficult times, Canadians need practical financial support as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641336">Alex Jahad, a physician who was the keynote speaker at the CAT conference, said in his address that informal caregivers are the largest invisible majority in health care. They are usually women who are also working and at the same time raising children. Less than one-quarter of these women receive any financial support from the system. In consequence, they themselves will develop chronic conditions and illnesses brought on by overwork and stress.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2641337">Dr. Jahad said that the amount of unpaid informal care that takes place in Canada translates to $80 billion to $90 billion of labour. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to remind the House about the NDP's position on increasing access to employment insurance for anybody who must take leave from work in order to take care of a sick relative.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641338">There are real changes that can be made to help fight breast cancer, and we know what they are. The experts have told us what they are. This government is lacking the political will to take serious action. We must fund programs and create the legislation that will have real effects on the lives of Canadians, not just short-term bandage solutions.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I know she is new to this chamber, but a royal recommendation is not permitted in a private member's bill. Funding of doctors is not something one can do through a private member's bill. Therefore, I think it is inappropriate to suggest it is something that could have been added to the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641341">May I also add that it is a bit disingenuous, in the sense that the member for <Affiliation DbId="170390" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation> is an active supporter of the Ontario New Democratic Party; when it was in power, for the first time in Ontario's history it cut medical enrolment, so the root challenge we face in Ontario, in her riding, exists because of the party she supported when it was in office. If we do not train and graduate doctors, we will not have them in our ridings to work on the many essential medical needs.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641342">With regard to the bill, one in nine women will be diagnosed with breast cancer at some time during their lives. According to the Canadian Cancer Society, over 24,000 Canadian women will have been diagnosed with breast cancer this year alone. Sadly, 5,000 of them will lose their fight. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2641343"> Cancer care has been a critical issue to me, and when I was presented with the opportunity to present a private member's bill, I knew instantly that I wanted to do something in this field. Every year, thousands of Barrie residents in my riding participate in the CIBC Run for the Cure. It really is inspiring to see so many people who care so much about battling this insidious disease.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641344">While putting thought to this bill, I felt it was important not only for women but for all of us to be aware of the fact that screening for breast cancer can save lives. Providing women with accurate information about screening is therefore important and will ultimately help them make decisions that are right for them. This is the essence of Bill <Document DbId="5142292" Type="4">C-314</Document>. Breast cancer is more easily treated and, in most cases, curable when found early.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641345">Dense breast tissue is one of the top risk factors for breast cancer, and it is important for women to be informed of this fact. This can be done when they are screened for breast cancer by a mammogram, but women who have breast dense tissue should also know that the potential cancer may not be detected because it cannot be seen on a mammogram and therefore diagnosed by radiologists. It appears white on mammograms and therefore is more challenging to detect.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2641346">What Bill <Document DbId="5142292" Type="4">C-314</Document> would do is highlight the importance of being informed and work with the provinces and territories through the national screening program in order to ensure that women receive this information.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641347">For many women, especially young women, who have a higher incidence of dense breast tissue, having this information is essential to their decision-making process. This knowledge will provide them with the tools they need to make personal health care decisions. </ParaText><ParaText id="2641348">Women who are informed that they have dense breast tissue may need to go for a different type of screening, such as an ultrasound or an MRI. Possible cancers may be deciphered more readily by a specialist using this type of diagnostic testing.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641349">We are fortunate in Canada to have screening programs for breast cancer. Our provinces and territories deliver these programs to detect breast cancer early, before it has spread, so that treatment can be started. Providing more information through these programs will help women and their doctors make well-informed decisions regarding breast cancer screening. Targeting dense breast tissue is one of the means by which, through this piece of legislation, we can make a tangible difference in the fight against breast cancer.</ParaText><ParaText id="2641350">I know too many loved ones, friends and even colleagues on the Hill, who have been touched by cancer. Through this bill I hope to not only make a difference but hopefully save lives. </ParaText>
