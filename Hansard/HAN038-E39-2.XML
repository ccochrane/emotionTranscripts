Second reading</ProceduralText><ParaText id="870304">He said: Mr. Speaker, I rise with great pride today to introduce for second reading Bill <Document DbId="3075385" Type="3">C-469</Document>, an act to amend the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, to prohibit the manufacturing, sale or import in Canada of dishwashing or laundry detergents that contain phosphorus.</ParaText><ParaText id="870305">The Bloc Québécois introduced this bill because many of us, like the hon. member for Shefford, noticed how widespread cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, had become last summer, and how serious a concern this was for the people of Quebec.</ParaText><ParaText id="870306">We know that blue-green algae pose a public health risk as potential irritants, allergens and toxins. </ParaText><ParaText id="870307">Besides this public health risk, the proliferation of cyanobacteria has a significant impact on the health and quality of lake water, not to mention the adverse effects on wildlife.</ParaText><ParaText id="870308">This is not a new issue, but the ongoing proliferation that has been observed over the past few years is a growing concern and calls for concerted action to put an end to this phenomenon. </ParaText><ParaText id="870309">Things have been getting worse: in Quebec, this phenomenon affected 50 lakes in 2005, 107 in 2006, and nearly 200 in 2007.</ParaText><ParaText id="870310">In the riding that I have the honour of representing, <Affiliation DbId="78662" Type="2">Berthier—Maskinongé</Affiliation>, blue-green algae were found in five lakes and rivers in 2007. This is a major problem in our region and in many others in Quebec. </ParaText><ParaText id="870311">Quebec is not the only province whose lakes and rivers are deteriorating. Other Canadian provinces are facing this threat too. Blue-green algae have invaded waters in Ontario, Manitoba, Nova Scotia and even Alberta.</ParaText><ParaText id="870312">Blue-green algae blooms are happening for a reason. It is important to explain what causes these organisms to appear and multiply in our watersheds, our lakes and rivers, and in all of our water sources.</ParaText><ParaText id="870313">Excessive growth of cyanobacteria is due to an overabundance of nutrients in the environment. Of these nutrients, phosphorus has the greatest impact. </ParaText><ParaText id="870314">Phosphorus is a naturally occurring nutrient used by algae and aquatic plants, and blue-green algae blooms occur when the amount of phosphorus in a water system exceeds the ability of the system to absorb it. The presence of excess phosphorus is directly linked to human activity. We must therefore act to address this phenomenon. </ParaText><ParaText id="870315">Human activities that lead to surplus phosphorus in the water system include dumping untreated or inadequately treated water, agricultural activity, fertilizing lawns, using septic systems, recreation and tourism, and deforestation.</ParaText><ParaText id="870316">We know that dish and laundry detergents are made with phosphates, compounds that contain phosphorus and that, when present in excessive quantities, contribute to the development of blue-green algae and cyanobacteria. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="05">(1105)</Timestamp><ParaText id="870317">While regulations have been in place for many years to limit phosphorus levels in laundry detergents, that is still not the case for dishwasher detergents and, more importantly, there is not a total ban.</ParaText><ParaText id="870318">Given this growing issue, it is important to remind this House that it is the Bloc Québécois that took the initiative. Indeed, in the spring of 2007, the Bloc Québécois critic on the environment and member for <Affiliation DbId="78641" Type="2">Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie</Affiliation>, whom I want to thank for his excellent work regarding this issue, blamed the Minister of the Environment for not dealing with this issue quickly. My colleague rightly pointed out that Ottawa could simply amend its regulations, without passing legislation, and thus take action quickly to protect our bodies of water.</ParaText><ParaText id="870319">Since Ottawa is responsible for regulating imported products, we felt that cooperation between Ottawa, Quebec and the provinces was necessary to deal effectively with the issue of blue-green algae.</ParaText><ParaText id="870320">On June 12, 2007, given the government's lack of concern, and its own desire to fight against the spread of blue-green algae, the Bloc Québécois tabled a motion, that was adopted by the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development, recommending that the federal government phase out concentrations of phosphorous in dishwasher detergents and laundry detergents. </ParaText><ParaText id="870321">Like several environmental groups, we condemned the Conservatives' decision to oppose this motion, which proposed a measure that is easily achievable and that would definitely have helped in the fight against the spread of these algae in our bodies of water.</ParaText><ParaText id="870322">We now know where the Conservatives stand regarding anything related to the environment. Because of this government's failure to do something, I started a petition, in September 2007, to get the federal government to act and amend its bill, so as to eliminate phosphates from dishwasher and laundry detergents. </ParaText><ParaText id="870323">In October 2007, I tabled in this House a first series of petitions with over 1,200 signatures, and this week I will again present a new series of petitions signed by over 2,000 people, asking the government to act.</ParaText><ParaText id="870324">I would like to thank the environmental groups, volunteers, not-for-profit organizations and municipalities that collected signatures for this petition. In doing so, they showed that they were determined to take action.</ParaText><ParaText id="870325">However, this government has refused to shoulder its responsibilities on this issue. That is why we introduced this bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="870326">Bill <Document DbId="3075385" Type="4">C-469</Document> would prohibit phosphates in dishwashing and laundry detergents. Currently, section 117 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, prohibits the manufacture for use or sale in Canada or the import of a cleaning product or water conditioner that contains a prescribed nutrient in a concentration greater than the permissible concentration prescribed for that product.</ParaText><ParaText id="870327">Bill <Document DbId="3075385" Type="4">C-469 </Document>adds provisions after section 117 that prohibit certain substances in dishwashing and laundry detergents and stipulate when these prohibitions come into force.</ParaText><ParaText id="870328">In short, the bill would prohibit the manufacture for use or sale in Canada, the import and the sale of laundry or dishwashing detergents containing phosphates.</ParaText><ParaText id="870329">The bill would also amend subsection 119(1) to make it comply with the amendments to section 117.</ParaText><ParaText id="870330">This is a small bill, but it represents an important step that this government and all parliamentarians could take to combat the problem of blue-green algae. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp><ParaText id="870331">We are calling on the federal government to take action in this area of federal jurisdiction to preserve the quality of our bodies of water. This legislation that we are proposing supports the various measures taken by the Government of Quebec to effectively fight blue-green algae and preserve the quality of our water and our aquatic ecosystems.</ParaText><ParaText id="870332">Recently, in the fall of 2007, in response to the spread of blue-green algae, Quebec's environment minister consulted with various stakeholders about how to address this wave. In the wake of these consultations, the Government of Quebec announced in December 2007 the adoption of regulations under its program to combat blue-green algae. </ParaText><ParaText id="870333">Quebec's action plan includes a series of regulatory tools and prevention and awareness mechanisms to help municipalities meet the challenges posed by the spread of blue-green algae. The plan also provides for the adoption of a regulation prohibiting the sale in Quebec of dishwashing detergents containing more than .5% phosphorus by 2010.</ParaText><ParaText id="870334">The Government of Quebec is addressing this environmental problem by duly exercising its powers under the Canadian Constitution. It is important to realize that the issue of jurisdiction in environmental matters means that, in practice, a policy to address an environmental problem could fall under the jurisdiction of either level of government. In other words, there can be a number of solutions to an environmental problem and therefore a number of jurisdictions involved.</ParaText><ParaText id="870335">As far as the use of phosphates is concerned, the National Assembly of Quebec has taken action in its jurisdiction. We are calling on the federal government to take its responsibilities and take action in its jurisdiction to protect our lakes and rivers. Since Ottawa is responsible for regulating imports, the federal government must also take action in order to have a real impact on manufacturers and force them to change their practices.</ParaText><ParaText id="870336">The adoption of such standards by Ottawa, with respect to the manufacture of laundry detergents and dishwasher detergents, would force manufacturers to adapt or be shut out of the Quebec and Canadian market. Since this is a very important market for them, the manufacturers will be much more likely to offer a product in compliance with the new Quebec and Canadian standards.</ParaText><ParaText id="870337">The Government of Quebec has urged the federal government to change its regulations in order to intensify the commercial impact of banning dishwasher detergents and other detergents that contain phosphates, thereby strengthening and making more effective the legislation that Quebec wants to implement.</ParaText><ParaText id="870338">The Bloc Québécois is well aware that banning detergent containing phosphates will not be enough to eradicate blue-green algae from our waters. This problem is complex and has been around for a number of years and will not be resolved in the immediate future. Other measures have to be taken by the Government of Quebec. We will be able to put an end to this problem with well-targeted action. We need to see an effort by all levels of government, municipalities, waterfront property owner associations, farmers and the general public. However, the federal government can ban the use of phosphates in detergents and it can do so quickly.</ParaText><ParaText id="870339">By taking swift action in this matter, the federal government will strengthen the Government of Quebec's action plan. By supporting Bill <Document DbId="3075385" Type="4">C-469</Document>, the federal government will also establish a clear consensus on the use of phosphorus in detergents.</ParaText><ParaText id="870340">I am calling on all parliamentarians to vote in favour of this bill.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Mulcair" id="2277460"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="113956" Type="2">Mr. Thomas Mulcair (Outremont, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="870341">Mr. Speaker, I would first like to thank my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78662" Type="2">Berthier—Maskinongé</Affiliation> for presenting this bill dealing with a factor that could make a contribution—as minimal as it may be—to helping the environment. However, in this important matter, every step in the right direction is always welcome.</ParaText><ParaText id="870342">I would like to ask my colleague a question. I listened carefully to his presentation and what I heard is that outside of the use of phosphorus in the agriculture sector, the use of dishwasher detergent in the resort sector may account for up to 5% of the problem. Thus, it would be worthwhile dealing with this matter. </ParaText><ParaText id="870343">I am very familiar with this matter because I worked on it with officials from Vermont. One thing is certain: pollution knows no borders. Therefore, we have to work together. According to the theory just presented by my colleague, we have to choose one or the other level of government—those are his words. However, he mentioned that agriculture was one of the major causes of this environmental problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="870344">The Quebec plan deals with this very indirectly, almost not at all. For its part, the NDP is calling for compensation for farmers in exchange for a buffer zone of about 10 metres rather than 3 metres. At this point, the three-metre standard is not cast in stone because only Ontario and Quebec apply it; Prince Edward Island requires a 10-metre buffer zone.</ParaText><ParaText id="870345">Is my colleague saying that the problem cannot be solved, even in light of the current surplus? The efforts of Fisheries and Oceans Canada provide a good example of two levels of government that must work together. In Quebec, Fisheries and Oceans Canada has its own work to do. When I was Quebec's Minister of the Environment, we always worked with Fisheries and Oceans Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="870346">Is it the official position of the Parti Québécois to state that the federal government does not have a role to play while respecting provincial jurisdictions? Excuse me, I was speaking of the branch of the Parti Québécois in Ottawa, the Bloc Québécois.</ParaText><ParaText id="870347"><B>An hon. member:</B> It is the same thing.</ParaText><ParaText id="870348"><B>Mr. Thomas Mulcair</B>: It is six of one and half a dozen of the other.</ParaText><ParaText id="870349">Do the separatists believe that it is inconceivable that the federal government could intervene while respecting provincial jurisdictions, for example by introducing agreements? Are they not more inclined to agree with us that it is possible for the federal government to have a constructive role and also respect provincial jurisdictions?</ParaText><ParaText id="870350">In short, we believe that any plan that fails to deal with the agricultural sector is destined to fail.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. André" id="2277484"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78662" Type="2">Mr. Guy André</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="870351">Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from the NDP for his question.</ParaText><ParaText id="870352">First, I should say that farming undeniably plays a major part in the blue-green algae problem. I might add, for the benefit of my colleague from the NDP, that there is actually no farming in the vicinity of several of the lakes contaminated by this algae. The problem, in fact, lies with the people, those who have been building cottages around lakes these past few years and plan to retire there. They use more water, more dishwashers and more products containing phosphorus that pollute our lakes.</ParaText><ParaText id="870353">I agree with the hon. member that we are not resolving the whole cyanobacteria issue, but we are dealing with a major part of the problem. </ParaText></Content></Intervention><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Warawa" id="2277487"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78966" Type="18">Mr. Mark Warawa (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the Environment, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="870354">Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to turn our attention to a discussion on phosphorus.</ParaText><ParaText id="870355"> The need for attention on this issue was evident this past summer but the challenge has not diminished with the change of season. The government is very concerned with any environmental problem that affects our freshwater systems and which can compromise the things we value: access to high quality, safe drinking water or the ability to swim or fish in a lake on a hot summer's day.</ParaText><ParaText id="870356">We know that phosphate contamination in surface water is a concern because phosphates can act as a nutrient that supports the growth of certain blue-green algae. Under conditions of high nutrient inputs, blue-green algae can form what is known as “blooms” which dominate the natural community as they outgrow other benign forms of algae.</ParaText><ParaText id="870357">These blue-green algae blooms are capable of producing toxins that can harm humans, livestock, pets, wildlife, fish and shellfish. These toxins may also cause skin rashes, throat or eye irritations or gastrointestinal disorders. Although toxins themselves are odourless and tasteless, other compounds produced by these blooms can cause foul taste and odour problems that impair the drinking and the recreational use of the water and cause beach closures.</ParaText><ParaText id="870358">It is important that we minimize the risk of these toxins by reducing the incidence of blue-green algae blooms wherever possible. In most cases, this can be best achieved by reducing the phosphate levels. However, because each water body and its drainage basin is unique, the best approach to phosphate control and management differs for each system and thus the major phosphate sources need to be carefully evaluated in each case.</ParaText><ParaText id="870359">While it may seem that these pollution sources are obvious, in reality the problem is complex because there can be numerous sources. In a given watershed, some of these phosphate sources can be difficult to locate and measure because they are spread out, as is the case for phosphates entering waterways from multiple sources such as fields, small tributaries and so on.</ParaText><ParaText id="870360">According to our current scientific information, the largest primary sources of phosphates at the national level in Canada are agriculturel and waste water. The government recognizes that blue-green algae growth in our lakes, rivers and streams is a serious problem. The problem is that dishwater detergent is only a small part of the problem, between 1% and 2%. We need to do more to have a real impact.</ParaText><ParaText id="870361">On September 24 of last year, we announced a plan to get tough on sewage drainage by bringing in tough new regulations on sewage treatment across Canada. These new rules will bring Canada in line with some of the toughest rules in the world, like those found in the European union. The regulations will set out new national baseline standards that will apply to over 4,000 waste water systems in Canada. These actions will lead to real water quality improvements.</ParaText><ParaText id="870362">Phosphorus is used in certain detergents and cleaning products to soften water, reduce spotting and rusting, keep dirt particles in suspension and enhance the performance of the cleaning. However, as noted, phosphorus is a nutrient and when released into the aquatic environment it can promote the growth of blue-green algae.</ParaText><ParaText id="870363">For that reason, phosphorus concentration regulations were put in place for laundry detergents in the 1970s when the treatment of municipal waste water effluent was much less advanced that it is today. Some European countries and some American states have also moved to limit phosphorus in laundry detergents and so far five American states have regulated concentrations in dishwater detergents.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp><ParaText id="870364">Environment Canada data suggest that detergents account for just over 1% of the total national releases of phosphates to surface water. There are already a number of cleaning products on the market that have low or negligible concentrations of phosphorus. Further, the Canadian Consumer Specialty Products Association, whose member companies produce 86% of all automatic dishwashing detergent sold in Canada, announced in October an industry wide led initiative to voluntarily limit phosphorous concentrations to one-half of 1% weight in dishwashing detergents by 2010.</ParaText><ParaText id="870365">Ultimately, science is needed for informed policy decisions so that actions are taken to tackle the right source at the right time and in the most efficient manner. In short, we are focusing on enhancing the science based upon which informed decisions can be taken to reduce the inputs from the major phosphate sources and better manage the risks.</ParaText><ParaText id="870366">I mentioned earlier that data shows agriculture and sewage to be the largest sources of phosphorous in Canada. Environment Canada scientists are working with their counterparts in Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada on the development of a national agri-environmental standards initiative. This is a set of non-regulatory standards that, when met, will help to protect the freshwater ecosystems from the harmful effects caused by excessive amounts of phosphorous and other pollutants from agricultural activities.</ParaText><ParaText id="870367">Implementing the national agri-environmental standards initiative would also identify watersheds that should be targeted for beneficial management practices as a component of farm plans. Proper implementation of farm plans will help lower inputs of phosphorous and other agricultural contaminants to acceptable levels.</ParaText><ParaText id="870368">Scientists from Environment Canada have been working with provincial and international partners using the science-based approach to remediate the Great Lakes since the 1980s. We strive to stay ahead of this issue elsewhere, working with local watershed groups in other areas of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="870369">I would like to share with Parliament some new projects that demonstrate how the government is collaborating with the provinces on integrated water resource management and agricultural watersheds. </ParaText><ParaText id="870370">Scientists from Environment Canada and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, along with their provincial counterparts and stakeholders, have reached agreement to assess the impacts of current agricultural practices and water quality and aquatic organisms in the LaSalle and Little Saskatchewan River basins in Manitoba. This work will result in a better picture of the contribution of agricultural activities to water quality and other nutrient related problems in the Lake Winnipeg basin.</ParaText><ParaText id="870371"> We will continue to work with our provincial, territorial and municipal counterparts to protect our watersheds and drinking water sources.</ParaText><ParaText id="870372">In short, it is critical that we focus our energies on actions that are truly effective in addressing the main sources of pollution to our watersheds. That is why the government supports a comprehensive, multifaceted approach. A strategic approach that integrates our efforts and is done in a collaborative manner with provincial and territorial governments will deliver the most effective results.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. McGuinty" id="2277497"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78527" Type="2">Mr. David McGuinty (Ottawa South, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="870373">Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for introducing this bill, which would address a complicated issue that has a profound impact on the health of Canadians. </ParaText><ParaText id="870374">I would like to start by saying that I appreciate the objective of Bill <Document DbId="3075385" Type="3">C-469</Document> and I will support it so that the House may bring it before a committee. However, a number of things must be examined before this bill can become law and take effect.</ParaText><ParaText id="870375">I would like to take a few minutes to debate some logical and necessary amendments, which I feel should be included in the bill at committee stage.</ParaText><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="870376">Why regulate phosphorus?</ParaText><ParaText id="870377"> It is important to understand why it is necessary to regulate phosphorus. Scientists have known for a long time that phosphorus, a naturally occurring substance, contributes significantly to the growth of blue-green algae, which contains cyanobacteria that is toxic to aquatic life as well as to humans when we drink it. Boiling the affected water does not destroy cyanobacteria, so it is vital that we stop phosphorus pollution at its source.</ParaText><ParaText id="870378">To give members an idea of the severity of the problem and of how blue-green algae is becoming an increasingly serious threat to the health of our communities, I note simply that last summer a record number of Canadian lakes and rivers were contaminated with this algae. In Quebec alone, 156 were affected and 90 were closed to swimming and boating. That is more than double the number of closures in the summer of 2006.</ParaText><ParaText id="870379">While the primary cause of blue-green algae is runoff from farm fertilizers and septic systems, together accounting for 98% of the problem, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78662" Type="2">Berthier—Maskinongé</Affiliation> is correct that the phosphorus levels in certain kinds of detergents, where it is added as a stain remover and cleanser, are also of significant concern.</ParaText><ParaText id="870380">However, Bill <Document DbId="3075385" Type="4">C-469</Document> goes too far. It calls for a complete ban on phosphorus when regulating the amount of phosphorus in detergents is all we need to do. It does not adequately distinguish between laundry detergents and different types of dishwashing detergent.</ParaText><ParaText id="870381">Allow me to make four points that will help clarify these issues for the House.</ParaText><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="870382">First, Bill <Document DbId="3075385" Type="3">C-469</Document> rashly calls for the prohibition of phosphorus in laundry detergents. Phosphorus is added to laundry detergents to help with rinsing ions, such as calcium and magnesium, in hard water so that other components of the soap can properly clean the clothing. However, the member's bill does not consider the fact that for several years now Canada has had regulations limiting the concentration of phosphorus in laundry detergents. The Phosphorus Concentration Regulations, in the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, limit the concentration of phosphorus in laundry detergents to 2.2% by weight. And these regulations are very effective.</ParaText><ParaText id="870383">For example, they helped drastically reduce the proliferation of blue-green algae in the Great Lakes, while still allowing consumers to use the minimum amount of phosphorus needed to do their laundry. I must also point out that manufacturers have found another ingredient that can help remove ions from hard water. Of these manufacturers, 95% have completely stopped using phosphorus. It is now almost exclusively used for industrial and commercial activities.</ParaText><ParaText id="870384">Therefore, prohibiting phosphorus in laundry detergents seems pointless and inconsistent with our current regulations.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="870385">Second, Bill <Document DbId="3075385" Type="4">C-469</Document> refers generally to all dishwashing detergent. In truth, we need be concerned only with automatic dishwashing detergent. Phosphorus is added to automatic dishwashing detergents so it can break up dried or greasy food soils, remove calcium lime film, sanitize dishes and help keep the dishwasher's jets and pipes free from obstruction so the machine can operate using less water and less energy. This is very different from liquid hand-dishwashing detergent, which is surfactant based and does not contain phosphorus. In my view it makes no sense to regulate all dishwashing detergent in general when we need be concerned with only one specific kind.</ParaText><ParaText id="870386">The problem dates back to when the original phosphorus control regulations were drafted, which was long before automatic dishwashers became a popular household appliance. Accordingly, while the phosphorus concentration of laundry detergents in Canada can be no more than 2.2% by weight, today most major brands of automatic dishwashing detergent have phosphate levels ranging from 3.3% to 8.7%. Some are as high as 20%. As we can see, the challenge is therefore not that these products contain phosphorus; it is that we are not controlling how much they contain. </ParaText><ParaText id="870387">Fortunately, Canadian industries are well aware of the problem. They are moving to correct it. The Canadian Consumer Specialty Products Association, whose member companies produce 86% of all the household automatic dishwashing detergent in Canada sold in Canada, is leading an industry initiative to limit phosphorus in automatic dishwashing detergent to a maximum of 0.5% by weight, effective July 2010. This would be the toughest standard in the world. </ParaText><ParaText id="870388">I believe we should support these companies in this initiative. Banning phosphorus outright would seem to unnecessarily and unduly punish an industry that is already adapting to address our concerns.</ParaText><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="870389">That is the third problem with Bill <Document DbId="3075385" Type="4">C-469</Document>. The wording of the bill does not take into account the fact that phosphorous is still an essential ingredient in dishwasher detergent, especially in industrial and commercial settings, where the machines are designed for large volumes of dishes and shorter cycles.</ParaText><ParaText id="870390">Unlike laundry detergent, the phosphorous in dishwasher detergent disinfects the dishes. Banning it completely could therefore seriously affect the health of Canadians. Experiments have shown that there is no suitable substitute for phosphorous at this time that can provide the level of cleanliness that consumers are looking for. One possible substitute, an alkali metal carbonate salt, has not yet been thoroughly tested and, therefore, the necessary quantities cannot be produced.</ParaText><ParaText id="870391">My fourth and final point has to do with the fact that, in deciding what Canada should do, the honourable members should have a clear understanding of the measures taken by some other jurisdictions, such as the United States and the European Union.</ParaText><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="870392"> In the United States, regulating phosphorous is a state issue, not a federal one. In the 1990s, the state of Arizona began to phase out phosphorous. In response, its citizens started driving across the border into neighbouring states to get better automatic dishwashing detergents because those available to them did not work.</ParaText><ParaText id="870393"> As of today, most jurisdictions in the U.S. are working with industry and moving to the standard of 0.5% in household automatic dishwashers by July 2010. Across the Atlantic, only a few countries in the European Union even have regulations on phosphates and none of them have implemented a complete ban. I mention this to underscore that North American industries are already moving to a standard that is equal to or better than standards anywhere else in the world.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="40">(1140)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="870394">I agree with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78662" Type="2">Berthier—Maskinongé</Affiliation>.

Even though we agree on the effort being made here, in terms of prohibiting the use of phosphates in dishwasher detergent, we believe that the federal government can do more, particularly when we see the very large amounts of money we have available right now. </ParaText><ParaText id="870401"> We have calculated the cost of providing proper compensation for farmers in Quebec, where there is a 10-metre riparian buffer strip. On average, we could pay $1,500 per hectare per year as compensation for that buffer strip. There are 7,000 kilometres of buffer strips, and it would be of little consequence if that were increased to 10,000 kilometres—because human nature being what it is, I imagine that as soon as compensation is offered, more will be discovered. A strip one kilometre long by 10 metres wide is exactly equal to one hectare. At $1,500 per hectare, the 10,000 hectares in question in Quebec would cost $15 million. It was calculated that it would cost $50 million altogether to provide genuine protection for all of the navigable and floatable watercourses in Canada. And this is a federal responsibility; Fisheries and Oceans Canada is already working on it. </ParaText><ParaText id="870402"> We are not saying that the federal government will dictate any conditions. Nothing would be imposed; rather, it would be a matter of working together with the provinces and reaching agreements. I am persuaded that if our common goal is to achieve a result, we will be able to find ways of doing it.</ParaText><ParaText id="870403"> We already have experience in this: the Bloc Québécois insisted on voting against an NDP bill whose intent was to make pesticide rules throughout Canada as stringent as the rules that already exist in Quebec. Do we think that a pesticide that makes its way into the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin, but originated in Ontario, could not have negative consequences for the health of people in Quebec? </ParaText><ParaText id="870404"> This demonstrates that we have to take a comprehensive view when we are dealing with environmental issues. When we talk about sustainable development, we have to take the environmental, economic and social aspects into account. We also have to understand that political borders mean very little.</ParaText><ParaText id="870405">When I was the Quebec Minister of the Environment, I remember spending two days in the United States with Manitoba Premier Gary Doer, to meet American officials. At the time, the governor of the state of North Dakota wanted to divert the water from Devils Lake to the Sheyenne River which, as we know, is a tributary of the Red River, which flows into Lake Winnipeg, a body of water that is already quite polluted by a number of other sources of pollution. Such a measure was out of the question as far as we were concerned. It is interesting to note that U.S. authorities were happily prepared to circumvent the Boundary Waters Treaty, which has been in existence for about a century between the United States and Canada. We managed to find a solution, in cooperation with the Americans. </ParaText><ParaText id="870406">So, considering that we are able to deal with these issues at the international level, the various levels of government within a country should be able to cooperate and find solutions. Indeed, it is all about finding a solution.</ParaText><ParaText id="870407">When I became minister in 2003, there was a huge blue-green algae problem in Missisquoi Bay, which is the body of water located at the top of Lake Champlain, on the Quebec side. Also, the river with the same name meanders over a long distance in the United States, before reaching Canada in Missisquoi Bay. It was estimated that 60% of the phosphorus that was creating a major blue-green algae problem was from the United States. Therefore, there would have been no point in introducing a bill that would not have had an international component. And there would have been no point in trying to solve the issue, if we did not deal with the agricultural aspect. </ParaText><ParaText id="870408">Whenever I talk about this issue, I am always careful to point out that we have no intention of blaming the agricultural industry. I realized something a long time ago, namely that 95% of farm producers already spend huge amounts of money to comply with agricultural standards. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="45">(1145)</Timestamp><ParaText id="870409"> The problem with riparian buffer strips that are only three metres wide is that it is virtually impossible to enforce them very effectively. It is very difficult. </ParaText><ParaText id="870410"> The New Democratic Party thinks that if we followed the example set by Prince Edward Island and extended these strips to ten metres, we would get much better, much more positive results. </ParaText><ParaText id="870411"> Throughout all my work with the Union des producteurs agricoles du Québec, that group has always stated unequivocally that it was not fundamentally opposed to wider buffer strips. Farmers have always told me, though, that this was their land and they wanted to be compensated if they were not going to be allowed to use it. We are actually asking them for something: to provide part of their arable land in the greater public interest. </ParaText><ParaText id="870412"> Lawyers might say that people have no right to be compensated for complying with laws and regulations. This case is unusual, though, because our consciousness has been raised and we are realizing now that some of the things we did in the past with our means of production are having undesirable effects. So if we want to ask producers to refrain from farming within a 30-foot or 35-foot riparian strip, they should be compensated. That is what the NDP is proposing. </ParaText><ParaText id="870413"> My colleague who introduced the bill on the phosphates in dishwasher products sits on the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development. We, for our part, are studying the possibility of working together with the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food. </ParaText><ParaText id="870414"> I would like to tell the House a little story. When we were in the Saint-Valérien-de-Milton area last summer to announce our plan, it was very interesting to see important representatives there from both the environmental sector, including Richard Marois of the Montérégie regional environmental council, and the agricultural sector. This was the best possible proof, in my view, of what a good job the NDP is doing. Instead of a divisive plan, we had one that brought the agricultural community and the environmental community together in support of a common cause. That is precisely what needs to be done in environmental issues. </ParaText><ParaText id="870415"> I listened very closely to what my Liberal colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78527" Type="2">Ottawa South</Affiliation> had to say and could not make any sense of it at all.

I have here a news release from the Canadian Consumer Specialty Products Association announcing a voluntary commitment to limit phosphorus content to 0.5% by weight, effective July 2010. </ParaText><ParaText id="870424">What is the member for <Affiliation DbId="78662" Type="2">Berthier—Maskinongé</Affiliation> proposing in his bill? Simply put, the bill aims to prohibit the manufacture, sale and import of these products. </ParaText><ParaText id="870425">The bill clearly states that once it comes into force, it will be against the law to manufacture, for use or sale, a cleaning product or water conditioner that contains nutrients, such as phosphorus.

With respect to the sale of such products, the prohibition would come into force 360 days after the bill receives royal assent.</ParaText><ParaText id="870427">I would like to say a few words about phosphates. I found it very interesting that people do not realize that the phosphates and phosphorus that end up in our lakes do not come from dishwashers alone. That much is clear. I will come back to that in my discussion of concentrations, percentages and how much dishwashers contribute, but we know that the main sources are agriculture and waste water. </ParaText><ParaText id="870428">When it comes to waste water, it is not easy to figure out how much comes from treatment plants because not all of them put waste water through a process to remove phosphates with a chemical known as alum. Not all treatment plants contribute to the problem. If waste water does not undergo tertiary treatment, phosphates often go right through treatment plants.</ParaText><ParaText id="870429">The other issue concerns septic tanks and septic fields. I believe there are also bills on the table in Quebec to strengthen or give more teeth to the regulations on septic tanks and septic fields. It is also important to point out that some isolated residences in our society still discharge household waste directly into septic tanks and therefore directly into the environment. </ParaText><ParaText id="870430">The aging of a body of water is known as lake eutrophication.

The pool was created in the early 1970s because of the recognized difficulty in having to constantly amend the Judges Act when jurisdictions needed an additional judge or judges. </ParaText><ParaText id="870459">This section is intended to permit the government to respond quickly to substantiated pressures on provincial superior courts. This bill would increase by 20 the number of appointments authorized under this section for judges of the trial courts and thus permit the appointment of 20 new judges to these courts.</ParaText><ParaText id="870460">The need for additional judicial resources to respond to existing and increasingly urgent pressures in the provincial superior courts has been clearly demonstrated, especially in six jurisdictions across Canada. Those jurisdictions are Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nunavut.</ParaText><ParaText id="870461">In Ontario and the Atlantic provinces, the need for more judges arises in the existing family branches of the superior courts, and is largely the result of enhanced child protection laws and a growing population.

For this reason, the proposed specific claims tribunal act provides that tribunal members must be superior court judges. </ParaText><ParaText id="870467">It is estimated that the tribunal will require the full time equivalent of six judges to handle its anticipated caseload of 40 claims per year. These claims are dispersed across the country with the greatest number arising in British Columbia, and some of the most complex cases originating in Ontario and Quebec.</ParaText><ParaText id="870468">All provincial superior courts are currently working at full capacity, with a number of them, as I have just described, experiencing significant backlogs and delays. As a result, authority for an additional six judges is being sought to provide the trial courts with the capacity to absorb the new work of the tribunal and to address these claims on a priority basis.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="05">(1205)</Timestamp><ParaText id="870469">It is intended that through this infusion of new judicial resources, the courts will be able to allow a number of their experienced judges to be appointed to a tribunal roster of up to 18 judges. It is proposed that these judges would sit on the tribunal on a part time basis for a period of time equivalent to the number of additional judges provided to the court. The judges appointed to the roster would continue to sit for the balance of their time on cases assigned as usual by the chief justice of their own court.</ParaText><ParaText id="870470">Allocation of the 20 new judges to specific jurisdictions will take place following consultations with chief justices of the affected courts and the provincial and territorial governments. These consultations will begin immediately to allow the requesting jurisdictions to refresh the data upon which their original proposals for new judges was based. </ParaText><ParaText id="870471">It will also provide governments and courts the opportunity to discuss the workload and functioning of the new specific claims tribunal. The goal is to be in a position to appoint the new judges as soon as possible after the passage of this legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="870472">We are extremely fortunate in Canada to have a judicial system that is independent and impartial. We take for granted that our judiciary will be fearlessly and fairly deciding on the basis of the facts and the law of each case, complicated issues that affect our children, our families, and our communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="870473">Our courts bear a tremendous responsibility. Each day they render decisions that have an impact on personal relationships, living arrangements and financial circumstances. These judges determine how parents will share responsibilities for their child, what level of support the child will receive, and sometimes whether a child can be safely left with parental care. At times the level of conflict between family members is extremely high, which increases the risk of negative repercussions for the children involved. There are few of us who do not experience a visceral reaction when we hear the facts of some of these cases.</ParaText><ParaText id="870474">Our judges cannot act upon these gut feelings. Throughout the process the court must be, and be perceived to be, completely unbiased and impartial. Public confidence in our judges and a decision they render demands no less. Maintaining an impartial and independent judiciary is thus the centrepiece of our justice system and we are rightly proud of the success we have achieved in this regard.</ParaText><ParaText id="870475">However, the protection of important principles such as independence and impartiality has little meaning to the average Canadian when the system is inaccessible to them. Average Canadians must have access to the court system for it to be properly functioning.</ParaText><ParaText id="870476">This government recognizes the social cost of maintaining a family justice system that is accessible and responsive to the needs of families in crisis. There is a social cost when the system is inaccessible. These costs include demands on the health care system and the criminal justice and youth justice systems that are incurred when family law issues are not dealt with in an effective and expedient manner. We have all witnessed as well the conflict and uncertainty that has arisen from past failures to establish a fair and impartial process for achieving binding resolutions on specific claims.</ParaText><ParaText id="870477">As members can see, this apparently minor amendment would have a significant impact on access to justice for a number of Canada's most vulnerable communities, including children in need of protection and aboriginal communities. It is also critical to the effective functioning of the new specific claims tribunal.</ParaText><ParaText id="870478">I am confident that all hon. members will recognize the true significance of this bill and will support its speedy passage.</ParaText></Content></Intervention></SubjectOfBusinessContent></SubjectOfBusiness></OrderOfBusiness><OrderOfBusiness id="2277564" Rubric="Other"><OrderOfBusinessTitle>Routine Proceedings</OrderOfBusinessTitle><CatchLine>Routine Proceedings</CatchLine><SubjectOfBusiness id="2277565"><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="10">(1210)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><SubjectOfBusinessTitle>Committees of the House</SubjectOfBusinessTitle><SubjectOfBusinessQualifier>Procedure and House Affairs</SubjectOfBusinessQualifier><SubjectOfBusinessContent><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mrs. Redman" id="2277545"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78469" Type="2">Hon.

With regard to the bill we are debating today, increasing the number of judges appointed may seem very pertinent given that every citizen has the right to have access to justice and the courts are backed up. This could be a very interesting bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="870490">However, over the past two years, we have become accustomed to having the governing party introduce very repressive laws, which have multiplied the number of trials.

In order to address that backlog, we need to create new positions. This bill does it in a comprehensive way, rather than a piecemeal way. It creates 20 new positions. It is going to go some way in addressing that backlog.</ParaText><ParaText id="870495">The hon. member mentioned the measures we are taking in the area of criminal justice.

This is my first opportunity to do so as the official opposition critic for justice. I must say, I look forward to working with my hon. colleagues on such important issues. </ParaText><ParaText id="870498">We have already heard some members ask the parliamentary secretary some questions. I have known him well for a few years now. He is, like me, a member from New Brunswick. I look forward to working with him and his colleagues on the House standing committee, so as to discuss these issues of mutual concern on the subject of justice, especially since I know the government is particularly concerned about criminal justice issues.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="870499">This piece of legislation which creates additional superior court positions in different jurisdictions across the country is something that we in the Liberal Party think should have been brought forward a number of months ago. In fact, in the previous Parliament it was legislation that was before the House at the same time as the legislation to deal with the recommendations of the quadrennial commission with respect to pay increases for federally appointed judges. It really is not new the idea that there is a backlog in the court system and that there is additional pressure on the trial courts across the country for a number of reasons which were correctly enunciated in many cases by the <Affiliation DbId="78963" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="870500">The Liberal Party sees this legislation as positive. We see it in a certain sense as unfortunate that it has taken this long. We would have preferred to see the government, in the legislation dealing with the quadrennial commission report some months ago, also include this particular provision to increase the number of seats on superior courts across the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="870501">The <Affiliation DbId="78963" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> referred to six jurisdictions where there have been identified backlogs. I can speak with some personal knowledge about the jurisdiction that the parliamentary secretary and I represent, the province of New Brunswick.</ParaText><ParaText id="870502"> It is a fact that in many cases, for example on an interim motion, in the family court in New Brunswick sometimes litigants have to wait eight months before being heard by a family court judge on what is a motion for interim relief. This is clearly an unacceptable circumstance. That is why the Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench of New Brunswick, the bar association and provincial attorneys general going back into the previous government had all been requesting that Parliament legislate to create additional spaces. In that sense, this legislation conforms to something that achieves a broad consensus across the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="870503">There is no doubt that the delays in family courts can be particularly troublesome. In many cases, because of changes in child protection legislation across the country, child protection cases clog up the docket. Because of the urgency of many of these matters they end up in effect bumping down the line some of the cases involving interim relief, cases of child custody, which can be very difficult and traumatic for families, not to mention the economic costs of continually having them delayed and adjourned.</ParaText><ParaText id="870504">For that reason, we think this legislation is needed and seeks to address a problem which has been identified for a number of years in many jurisdictions as pressing.</ParaText><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="870505">As for the 20 new appointments the government would make, if Parliament were to pass this bill, I would like the parliamentary secretary to be a little more conscious of linguistic issues, for instance, in my province, New Brunswick. We saw some strange situations, where bilingual or even francophone judges were replaced by unilingual anglophone judges. Once again, this has meant delays for anyone who wishes to plead their case before the courts in New Brunswick in French.</ParaText><ParaText id="870506">In one particular instance in the Moncton area, a francophone judge was appointed. The fact that someone was appointed who can conduct trials in French was very much appreciated. It was very important.</ParaText><ParaText id="870507">I would also ask the government to be equally aware of the fact that, in other jurisdictions in Canada, linguistic balance can be very important, if one claims to truly care about the issue of trials subject to delays or the issue of access to justice. Access to justice in one's mother tongue is also a fundamental question. If we cannot find a way to appoint judges who can conduct these trials or hear evidence in English or French, depending on the case, trial delays will increase at an alarming rate.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="870508">The parliamentary secretary also talked about the specific claims tribunal. Again, this will put additional pressure on superior court judges in some jurisdictions. There is no doubt that supernumerary judges or judges of long experience may in many cases be ideally suited to do a rotation on some of these specific claims tribunals, which means that chief justices in these jurisdictions will again have a need for more resources and for an increase in judges to hear some cases that have waited for a very long time. That is another valid reason why Parliament should consider increasing the number of superior court judges.</ParaText><ParaText id="870509">On this side of the House, we in the Liberal Party have some concern with respect to the appointments process this particular Conservative government has undertaken. One of its first acts was to attempt to stack the judicial appointments advisory committees in the provinces to ensure that the <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> would in fact control a majority of the members of the judicial appointments advisory committees in the provinces. </ParaText><ParaText id="870510">The parliamentary secretary talked about the independence of the judiciary. This is certainly something that I think all members value greatly. That independence is not enhanced when we try to stack and manipulate the independent process by which the qualifications of judicial candidates are assessed.</ParaText><ParaText id="870511">At the time of these changes, we raised some concerns about why the government would decide that it is important to have representatives of the police on these advisory committees. If one of the delays or concerns the parliamentary secretary identified is with respect to family courts across the country, or in some jurisdictions, the value that a police officer brings to the selection or evaluation of candidates for a family court appointment I think shows that the government was simply trying to pretend to give law enforcement a role in a process that really should be independent.</ParaText><ParaText id="870512"> The minister should have resisted the temptation to be able to stack and manipulate these committees to ensure that he always would have a majority on each committee in every province, committees that are given the important responsibility of evaluating the competence and credentials of the men and women seeking to be appointed to the superior court.</ParaText><ParaText id="870513">Therefore, at committee we intend to look also at the issue of the appointments process. We are not satisfied that the government has been entirely responsible with respect to the independence of this appointment process, but we do recognize that there is a need to give these courts across the country increased resources. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, this is why we regret that this was not brought forward many months ago. The ideal time would have been when the government legislated its response to the quadrennial commission report.</ParaText><ParaText id="870514">In conclusion, I think all members share the sentiment that for those who seek to appear before the superior courts in jurisdictions across the country, whether it is with respect to a criminal charge and a criminal matter, a family law matter, other civil litigation or, in this particular example, with respect to specific claims tribunals, timely access to justice has long been held to be a fundamental right of Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="870515"> In criminal law, the Askov case, as members will know, redefined what is reasonable access, that is, the right to be heard within a reasonable time. Surely that same principle in criminal law applies with respect to some of the most difficult cases in family law, where the custody of children can be at issue, where families are seeking to have their cases heard, and where, I think all members will agree, an eight month delay on an interim motion for interim relief simply does not make sense. </ParaText><ParaText id="870516">That is why if the government proceeds with this legislation quickly it will find that members of the Liberal Party are anxious to cooperate, but we would urge the government to resist the temptation in these appointments to once again seek out partisan appointments or once again attempt to manipulate the process by which the minister is given a list of persons, men and women, qualified to be appointed to the superior courts.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="870517">We believe that access to justice within a reasonable timeframe is a fundamental right, just as access to justice in one's first language is also a fundamental right in Canada. We therefore urge the government to respect these values.</ParaText><ParaText id="870518">We have been somewhat worried about some of the appointments made in recent months. Even so, we believe that adding 20 positions at the superior court and tribunal level should be fast-tracked by the House.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mrs. Freeman" id="2277561"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78327" Type="2">Mrs. Carole Freeman (Châteauguay—Saint-Constant, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="870519">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to join the debate on something that directly affects the proper functioning of our justice system and thus the people of Quebec and Canada. I am talking about Bill <Document DbId="3138582" Type="3">C-31, An Act to amend the Judges Act</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="870520">The purpose of the bill is to allow a greater number of judges to be appointed to superior courts of the provinces, or 20 more judges than the current limit. The intention of this increase is to improve the flexibility of the justice system in order to process the many cases before the superior courts more quickly and more efficiently. The bill will also allow judges from superior courts to be assigned to the new specific claims tribunal, which was created by the Specific Claims Tribunal Act.</ParaText><ParaText id="870521">I should mention, with respect to this bill, that my constituents have often talked to me about how cumbersome and slow the current justice system is. However, let us make a distinction between cliché and reality. We have to acknowledge that the complexity of the cases, the proceedings, the needless procedures and a shortage of judges are causing delays. Nonetheless, I know that the increased number of cases, in family law in particular, is such that parents in Quebec sometimes have to wait several months before their alimony or custody case is finally settled by a judge. </ParaText><ParaText id="870522">This is an unfortunate situation, but it is so because the number of judges provided for under the Judges Act has not changed for years. Accordingly, the Act does not take into account the population increase and the resulting new social realities, including divorce and increasingly complex cases.</ParaText><ParaText id="870523"> At present, the Judges Act provides for a Chief Justice, a Senior Associate Chief Justice and an Associate Chief Justice for the Superior Court of Quebec, and for 140 other judges. For anyone who knows a little bit about the judicial system in Quebec, I would point out that the Superior Court hears civil and commercial cases where the amount at issue is over $70,000, administrative and family law cases, bankruptcy cases, jury trials and criminal trials, and appeals in summary conviction cases.</ParaText><ParaText id="870524"> Under paragraph 24(3)(<I>b</I>) of the Judges Act, the Superior Court of Quebec may still appoint 30 new judges, above and beyond its current 144 judges, to meet the needs that arise. Under Bill <Document DbId="3138582" Type="3">C-31</Document>, it could go ahead and have 50 additional judges. Clearly, that amounts to a ceiling that is higher than the one we have now by 20 judges. </ParaText><ParaText id="870525"> In the opinion of the Bloc Québécois and myself, adding judges to handle the many cases before the courts is part of the solution for improving access to justice. Undeniably, it is the government’s duty to make sure that the public has access to the courts when they need it, that all accused persons are able to stand trial within a reasonable time, and that the system is not handicapped by a shortage of judges. </ParaText><ParaText id="870526"> However, this must not become a panacea! I say this while at the same time believing that Bill <Document DbId="3138582" Type="3">C-31</Document> is not a bad bill—quite the contrary—but the intended effects could be diminished by the ideology of this minority government, focused as it is on “law and order”. This approach concerns me, and I would like to share my concerns with my distinguished colleagues and with the general public watching us today. </ParaText><ParaText id="870527"> In my speeches in the past, and in my work on the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, I have frequently referred to my grave concern about the enforcement-oriented approach taken by the Conservatives. It has expanded considerably since this government changed the rules for the judicial advisory committees. In my view, this manoeuvre by the Conservatives, along with a number of others I will talk about later, suggests that these amendments are somewhat secondary details in their minds. </ParaText><ParaText id="870528"> Why is it so important to debate this? Because every one of our fellow citizens expects to have an impartial, objective judicial system, where they feel protected from any political or ideological position that might influence a judgment. It seems, however, that the recent judicial appointments made by this government do not adhere to the idea of impartiality that the public expects. This interventionist attitude is extremely disturbing, and I believe it is important that people be made aware of what this minority government is doing and planning to do to ensure that its “law and order” ideology can be implemented smoothly.</ParaText><ParaText id="870529"> In the case of judicial appointments, my colleagues will stand firmly behind me when I say that we have to try to strike a balance. That is why our judicial system is founded on an independent judiciary.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp><ParaText id="870530"> The Bloc Québécois has been saying for a long time now in this House that we are looking forward to the day when there will no longer be partisan appointments to the judiciary, when we will have independent committees selecting our judges, selecting people with the very best qualifications.</ParaText><ParaText id="870531">I am not saying the current judiciary is not qualified, but I am saying that often judges are appointed in a partisan and political manner. The media regularly decries this practice and shares its displeasure with the public, who in turn become cynical. The government must not try to appoint judges that suit its ideology, because that could interfere with the impartiality of the courts, a fundamental rule of justice shared by all citizens. </ParaText><ParaText id="870532">Once again, to all those who are not very familiar with the judicial appointment system, it has often been debated because of the political interference that has been found.</ParaText><ParaText id="870533">The problem currently before us is twofold: on one hand this minority government has changed the judicial appointment process; on the other hand it is taking advantage of these changes to ensure a position on the judiciary for candidates who are ideologically in favour of or well connected, directly or indirectly, to the Conservative Party.</ParaText><ParaText id="870534">Let us be clear: this practice was not invented by the Conservatives, since they themselves have criticized the Liberals for doing the same thing in the past. However, these accusations illustrate the extent of the problem of appointing judges and the impartiality of the justice system.</ParaText><ParaText id="870535">For those who are watching us, I will provide some context by saying that judges are appointed by the government from a list made by a judicial advisory committee whose members voted for the candidate they deem best qualified.</ParaText><ParaText id="870536">Before the changes made by the Conservatives, the advisory committees had seven members. Out of seven evaluators, four members were politically independent, in other words, there was a representative from the Canadian Bar Association, another from the bar of the province concerned, a representative of the provincial department and, finally, someone to represent the judges. The three other members were appointed by the federal Department of Justice came from the public. These individuals frequently subscribed to the ideas of the government of the day.</ParaText><ParaText id="870537">It is important to realize that, as it turned out, the federal government was in the minority on that committee and therefore could not impose a candidate. </ParaText><ParaText id="870538">Nevertheless, the Conservative government was not happy about this situation because it would have had a hard time passing its political “law and order” agenda for justice. So without consulting the legal community, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78576" Type="2">Provencher</Affiliation>, who was then Minister of Justice, changed the makeup of the advisory committees as follows: First, in addition to the three members of the public, he decided to appoint a police officer, thereby ensuring that four members would be government supporters. Then he denied the judges' representative the right to vote except to break a tie. And there you have it. The government gave itself a majority on these committees and was able to impose its repressive “law and order” ideology with ease. </ParaText><ParaText id="870539">I can already hear people protesting that this will not compromise the qualifications of those appointed, that we are exaggerating, or that we think this creates opportunities to interfere even though it does not. </ParaText><ParaText id="870540">However, various events have proven us right. I am not just talking about a few isolated cases. I am talking about a system that has a direct impact on the objectivity of our legal system.</ParaText><ParaText id="870541">I would like to draw to my distinguished colleagues' attention the results of <I>The Globe and Mail</I>'s investigation into the matter, published on February 12, 2007, which showed that, apart from the police officers, no fewer than 16 of the 33 individuals appointed to 12 advisory committees were connected in some way to the Conservative Party. Sixteen of them. Coincidence? Unlikely. The newspaper revealed a number of cases where the connection was extremely clear. </ParaText><ParaText id="870542">Once again, some may say that this does not mean the individuals are not well suited to the job, that there is no conflict here, and that nobody is trying to push any agenda whatsoever. Nothing could be further from the truth.</ParaText><ParaText id="870543">In response to repeated questions about these appointments, the Prime Minister's own statements indicated that our concerns about changes to the advisory committees were well founded.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp><ParaText id="870544"> The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said, on February 15, 2007, in this House, “We want to make sure we are bringing forward laws to make sure that we crack down on crime, that we make our streets and communities safer. We want to make sure our selection of judges is in correspondence with those objectives”. The result is that they add a police officer and make partisan appointments to the advisory committees and take the vote away from the judiciary! </ParaText><ParaText id="870545"> I have no hesitation in saying that our police officers do very honourable work. That does not mean, though, that they are necessarily the best qualified to participate in the appointment of judges who hear mostly non-criminal cases. I should say as well that police officers represent primarily the executive branch of government, which is subject to judicial control. The presence of a police officer on a committee of this kind would further undermine the separation of powers on which our constitutional state is based. </ParaText><ParaText id="870546"> It is blatantly obvious, therefore, that citizens cannot count on an impartial judicial system so long as this scheme is in place. When it comes to justice, this government should think long and hard about its real objectives. </ParaText><ParaText id="870547"> When we look at the concerns I have listed—the political manoeuvring surrounding the evaluation committees, the elimination of a program like the legal challenges program, and the law and order ideology of this government—I am puzzled by the proposals in Bill <Document DbId="3138582" Type="3">C-31</Document> to improve the legal system.</ParaText><ParaText id="870548"> Certainly, more judges should improve access to justice, but if the Conservative ideology is rapidly implemented, how will the proposed change in Bill <Document DbId="3138582" Type="3">C-31</Document> be enough to meet the demand? If the Conservatives want to punish rather than prevent, the legal system will quickly become overloaded. At the other end of the spectrum, adding judges will not do any good when people do not have the means to exercise their rights.</ParaText><ParaText id="870549"> In conclusion, the Bloc Québécois will support Bill <Document DbId="3138582" Type="3">C-31</Document>. Maybe some things can be clarified during study in committee. In any case, though, the problem remains: partisanship will always play a major role in the selection of judges regardless of the total number of judges on a superior court. The Bloc Québécois will always continue the fight to eliminate partisan appointments to the bench. It will do all it can to help the people get truly independent committees that choose judges in such a way that we get those who are most competent.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Comartin" id="2277567"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78397" Type="2">Mr. Joe Comartin (Windsor—Tecumseh, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="870550">Mr. Speaker, Bill C-31 is one paragraph long and simply increases the number of judges, from 30 to 50, at the superior court level across the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="870551">We need to put this in context in terms of the number of judges who sit at that level. The figure is somewhere in the range of about 750 to 800. Then there are a number of others who sit at the appeals level, plus the those who sit in the Federal Court. This section of the Judges Act was designed to allow for an increase in the number of judges appointed in this special category based on requests from the provinces and territories.</ParaText><ParaText id="870552">Other than appreciating that number, it is important to put in context the current situation and the length of time since there has been any increase in the absolute number of superior court justices across the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="870553">The simple fact is the increase in number does not even keep up with the overall growth of the population in Canada. Of the 20 judges to be added, 6 would be designated to go to the specific claims tribunal and would not be in our regular courts. Therefore, we would only get 14 additional trial judges at the superior court level across the country. The population increase far outstrips on a percentage basis, a per capita basis, those additional numbers of judges.</ParaText><ParaText id="870554">Across the country, bar associations, law societies and judicial councils have called on the federal government to increase the number of judges and hasten the number of appointments when vacancies are available. In my home province of Ontario, administrative senior judges have been unusually public in criticizing the government for the slow pace of appointments it has made. </ParaText><ParaText id="870555">We have heard from some of the other opposition parties the concern about the new appointment process introduced by the government. I do not think anybody who is objective about the process sees it as anything other than a very clear attempt on the part of the government, and in particular the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, to ideologically shift the bench in the way appointments would be made. </ParaText><ParaText id="870556">It is not that the former Liberal administration was not guilty of similar misconduct in the way it made appointments, particularly of a partisanship nature, but this attempt to ideologically shape the bench is regrettable in a democratic society.</ParaText><ParaText id="870557">Again, I want to put in context the difficulties our judiciary has with the increased workload with which it is faced. Legislatures across the country continue to pass laws that, in effect, promote additional litigation. I do not want to overemphasize it, but this is true in the criminal law area. However, when the government introduced the appointment process change about a year and a half ago, what came out in the hearings of the justice committee was the small number of cases, percentage-wise, that were of a criminal nature at this level of the courts. The vast majority of criminal trials and proceedings in the criminal justice system are at the provincial court level, a different level than where these judges are.</ParaText><ParaText id="870558">What happens at this level and what increases the workload, not the sheer number of cases, although those are going up, is the number of super trials. These are trials that will go on for months and months and, in some cases, years. These are cases under the Criminal Code, under our anti-drug legislation, and they take up the entire year of a judge's workload at times. We are seeing more of those cases coming, not just in the drug area but in some security crimes that end up in front of the judges. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp><ParaText id="870559">Therefore, the sheer number of cases is not going up. What is up going up is the length of the trials and the number of hours judges have to commit to those very lengthy trials. </ParaText><ParaText id="870560">That is true as well in civil litigation. I think of the amount of additional judicial time that was taken up across the country as the reforms went through in our auto insurance legislation. In Ontario, at one period of time, I was dealing with four separate pieces of legislation that affected automobile accidents depending on when they had occurred. This imposed significant additional burdens on our courts because they had to interpret those statutes as the law changed, which took up additional hours. That is repeated by any number of other examples across the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="870561">The number of hours spent on the criminal cases is going up. Similarly, the number of hours on civil litigation cases of a general nature is going up. Those trials are also becoming longer.</ParaText><ParaText id="870562">I can remember hearing some of our more senior judges describe what it was like to do a trial 20, or 30 or 40 years ago compared to the amount of additional work and hours that now went into these cases, with more expert witnesses and more witnesses generally called. A trial that might have taken 3 to 5 days is now taking 20 to 30 days in just the standard automobile accident trial where there is any kind of severe injury.</ParaText><ParaText id="870563">In addition to that, and perhaps where the greatest additional burden in absolute hours has come from, has been in the matrimonial law area. It is taking two forms. The sheer number of trials has increased dramatically. The interim motions and interim work that go on prior to trial and the time superior court justices are in court to hear the motions has quadrupled, and in some cases even more, their basic workload. That has gone up quite dramatically. It has been compounded by the number of files where one of the two parties, in some cases both of the parties, are self-represented. The reason for that is the costs in the vast majority of cases.</ParaText><ParaText id="870564">When I first started practising in the early seventies, a family law trial including a divorce, property settlement and the issue of support, whether spousal or child, would normally take two to three days. Those trials are now taking a minimum of 10 days and it is not unusual for them to go 20 or 30 days.</ParaText><ParaText id="870565">We are not talking millions of dollars. In most cases we are talking of the average family in Canada with assets of maybe a couple of hundred thousand dollars and incomes in the mid-range. That is what trials cost at the present time. Therefore, many applicants and defendants before the courts cannot afford to be represented by legal counsel. This inevitably leads to much longer trials. From talking to judges, a great deal of frustration on their part is trying to ensure that the individual representing himself or herself gets a fair hearing and that the process is fair to both the represented party and the non-represented party.</ParaText><ParaText id="870566">The additional thing that happens, and it goes back to the shortage of judges, is this phenomenon in the matrimonial area in particular has resulted in additional costs. I think one of the Toronto papers through the holiday break did a lengthy article on the number of adjournments that had to be granted because there was not enough judges available in the province of Ontario. I know it is a problem in my hometown of Windsor and I understand it to be a problem across the province of Ontario. I also believe it is a problem right across the country.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp><ParaText id="870567">When clients are represented by counsel, counsel goes to court with them on one of these interim motions, which usually takes an hour to two hours to argue. A lengthy list may have 10 or 20 files before the judge that day. If too many of them do not get resolved, that is if they are argued, obviously the judge runs out of time before the end of the day and the case gets adjourned.</ParaText><ParaText id="870568">However, the lawyer, who has prepared for the motion, sits all day in court waiting for it to be heard and, if it is adjourned, the lawyer charges the client for that time. The same thing happens again a week or a month later and it may be adjourned again. In Toronto, in particular, we are seeing repeated adjournments of that nature. This costs the clients more money and forces them, in a number of cases, after a period of time of being represented, to take on their own representation, which prolongs the amount of time that is being spent.</ParaText><ParaText id="870569">That is the context in which we are functioning. Again, the appointments of the additional 14 judges, while welcomed and needed, will not be adequate to deal with the problems.</ParaText><ParaText id="870570">I want to make a final point with regard to the criminal law cases. From a number of questions that I and other members of the justice committee have asked at the justice committee when legislation has come forward, I know the government has not been doing an analysis, as the amendments to the Criminal Code have come forward, on how much additional court time these cases would take.</ParaText><ParaText id="870571">I want to put this into context. When we increase penalties in particular or we create new crimes with severe penalties attached to them, we end up with fewer pleas of guilty, fewer negotiated plea bargains and many more trials. We have not seen that increase yet but that will be coming over the next while. Again, the sheer number of cases in front of our criminal courts is not likely to go up much but I believe the length of them will go up quite dramatically because most of these cases from where this new legislation is coming deal with more severe crimes. The government has not done an analysis of how much more judicial time will be needed to take care of that.</ParaText><ParaText id="870572">At the end of the day we are asking our judges to cope with a growing population and the number of cases that have been added to their trial lists as a result of that. In each one of the major areas that they must deal with, criminal law, matrimonial law and general civil litigation law, which includes commercial litigation, the amount of work they are doing per file is going up dramatically and, in some cases, the number of files is also going up.</ParaText><ParaText id="870573">The NDP members will be supporting the bill but we are urging the government today, and we will be doing the same at the justice committee when the bill gets there, to seriously consider augmenting this relatively modest number of additional judges and look at increasing the number more substantially in keeping with what we are hearing from the judicial councils, the bar associations and the law societies.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Silva" id="2277571"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78983" Type="2">Mr. Mario Silva (Davenport, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="870574">Mr. Speaker, although our party supports Bill <Document DbId="3138582" Type="3">C-31</Document> because we understand that there is a need to deal with the backlog in the superior court system, I agree with my colleague that it is not an adequate solution.

They did not see them as part of the structure so much as being an impediment to the structure of government, which is, quite frankly, frightful in a democracy. </ParaText><ParaText id="870577">The Conservatives have made allegations over patronage appointments, which have some validity. An analysis was done on the appointments made by the former Liberal government and it was found that a number of people had direct involvement with the Liberal Party prior to their appointment as a judge.</ParaText><ParaText id="870578">What that analysis always misses is that no matter which party appoints them and no matter what their affiliation may or may not have been, the vast majority of judges, because of the legal training and their experience in our courts and in our law schools, they take an independent stance once appointed. That is something that did not seem to fit into the vision that our current Prime Minister has of the judiciary.</ParaText><ParaText id="870579">We have an excellent judiciary.

In that regard, a little over two years ago an aboriginal lawyers' group that appeared before committee were quite proud of the fact that for the first time 100 lawyers had come out of first nations and Métis communities. That was a very negative comment with regard to recruitment from our law schools. In Ontario alone we have something like 30,000 lawyers and of those 30,000 only about 30 or 40 of them have come out of first nations.</ParaText><ParaText id="870590">Another thing concerns me about the bill.

As he outlined, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made some embarrassing comments about that when he was in opposition but when his party became government it actually did things to change the ridiculous roll back of judges' wages. The Conservatives also changed the appointment process, stacking it with government appointees even though they did not have to follow the appointments. They changed the qualification requirements so they could pick anyone out of the group.</ParaText><ParaText id="870592">I wonder if the member could comment on that total attack on judicial independence which was a hallmark of the justice system in Canada until the Conservatives took power.</ParaText><ParaText id="870593">I wonder if my colleague could also comment on whether the appointment of 14 more judges to deal with the backlog is an indictment of the government's failure to deal with crime. The Conservatives have identified crime as one of their high priorities. However, had they been dealing with crime in ways that we have both promoted, such as dealing with the cause, recidivism, et cetera, then less judges would be needed, not more. Is this not an indictment of the government's failure to deal properly with crime and to reduce crime in the country?</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Comartin" id="2277581"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78397" Type="2">Mr. Joe Comartin</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="870594">Mr. Speaker, quickly on the points about the government not dealing with crime with a holistic viewpoint and with regard to its judicial appointments, one of the things that is of concern to a lot of trial lawyers in the country, in particular those on the prosecution side, is that we are going to get hit with another Askov type of decision by a superior court.</ParaText><ParaText id="870595">The backlog in the criminal area is increasing dramatically. A number of cases have been dismissed. The fear is that at some point there is going to be an overwhelming decision by one of our superior courts or appeal courts that is going to strike down a large number of criminal cases. It is not going to be an issue of dealing with them at all; they are just going to be out of the court system. When it happened in Ontario back in the early 1990s, it included a number of serious criminal cases that were dismissed at that point because they had not been dealt with in a proper fashion.</ParaText><ParaText id="870596">To deal with the issue of the government's attitude toward our judiciary and in particular its trying to interfere with the independence of the judiciary, probably the classic example of this is the former justice minister, not the present one, who sat with us on our review of judicial appointments. The position that he consistently took was that of wanting to create a less partisan appointment process, which was the case under the Liberals in a number of cases, one where the person being appointed is the absolute best choice in the country or in that region, without caring about his or her political affiliation one way or the other, not as a positive or a negative. It would be that we simply went on merit and took the very best candidate. </ParaText><ParaText id="870597">I remember how hard he pushed for that when he was the justice critic for the Conservatives. Now that they are in power we see what they are in fact doing, which again is to very much move away from the complete independence of the judiciary, as our Constitution requires, and toward a very clear, focused attempt to ideologically affect the appointment process, which would then ideologically affect the judiciary at all levels all the way up to the Supreme Court of Canada.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Bagnell" id="2277583"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78942" Type="2">Hon. Larry Bagnell (Yukon, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="870598">Mr. Speaker, I would like to continue with the theme that the problem is not the number of judges, although I think everyone agrees with regard to the backlog and the specific claims process, which we are all supporting. The problem is in the way judges are appointed. If the way judges are appointed is such a disaster, which it has been as handled by the government, of course if we have more judges the problem is just going to increase.</ParaText><ParaText id="870599">When the Conservatives came to power they went around the process of the judges' salaries and put the iron fist on that. Once again, they inhibited the independence of the process and the judiciary by interfering in that process. Then they rejigged the whole judicial appointment process in ways that were roundly criticized by most judicial system experts across the country. It was only a recommendation. They would stack the appointment of judges in favour of the government. </ParaText><ParaText id="870600">That is not a secret agenda. This was quite open because the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself made the point that they needed the judges not to be independent, but to implement government policy, to make their interpretation of the law so that it would affect government policy rather than be an independent, fair, just interpretation of whatever laws there are. Of course, then government can change the laws if it does not like how they are interpreted.</ParaText><ParaText id="870601">I of course want to support the point on specific claims. This is a very important procedure that will definitely support the judges who will be required to catch up on the horrific backlog of claims for aboriginal people in this country and get some of those longstanding claims finally dealt with.</ParaText><ParaText id="870602">The final point I want to make is on the failure of the government to deal with crime. Although crime is being reduced in Canada, the government chose this as a high priority, and if it had been successful during its mandate there would have been a reduction in crime and we would need fewer judges, not more. </ParaText><ParaText id="870603">What is the reason for this? There was a wonderful show on CBC's <I>The Current</I>, last Thursday I believe, in which Anna Maria Tremonti talked about the failures in the federal jails in Canada. If we are going to reduce crime and a majority of crime is repeat crime, how do we deal with that? We have debated this numerous times in the justice committee. We have heard the experts' solutions. We have heard police officers' solutions.</ParaText><ParaText id="870604"> Those solutions deal with making sure those crimes do not occur in the first place. They deal with removing the root causes of crime. They deal with removing overcrowding and poverty. They deal with the lack of ability to gain meaningful employment, whatever the reason might be. They deal with removing the much lower achievement of aboriginal people, on average, and with getting their school system up to the same level of achievement and therefore the same opportunities for gainful employment. </ParaText><ParaText id="870605">As the CBC analyzed with great care last week, this also deals with the treatment of prisoners. There are the criminals, in jail, where we have access to them, and they are going to reoffend unless they are treated properly. The program showed repeated examples of insufficient treatment, educational opportunities and anger management. Quite often the inmates themselves were asking for these services, these things that would help them return to society.</ParaText><ParaText id="870606">At committee, the experts told us that longer jail terms in many cases actually increase crime because jail is like a university of crime and inmates who are away longer from a quickly evolving society do not then have the ability to easily integrate. However, if they have the skills, they come out to a whole different world. It just exacerbates the situation if they are not getting training in the institution. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp><ParaText id="870607">There has been one great leap forward in training and rehabilitation. It relates to alternative sentencing and different types of treatment of criminals outside of simple incarceration. A few weeks ago at an Ottawa city committee that deals with this, the chief of police gave marvellous examples of how that system had much greater rehabilitation effects.</ParaText><ParaText id="870608"> We have failed for probably a thousand years to rehabilitate and to succeed in stopping recidivism, but at least some of these group conferencing and other types of non-incarceration sentences are actually having an effect. That effect is 60% to 70% in stopping a person from repeating a crime, whereas traditional incarceration has an effect of roughly only 40%.</ParaText><ParaText id="870609"> We have finally come upon a new system that is having some effect on certain levels of criminals, but the government tried to pass a bill that would eliminate this for the vast majority of crimes. Fortunately, that bill did not pass. It was stopped.</ParaText><ParaText id="870610">Another example is that of the aboriginal court justice workers. The program was renewed at the eleventh hour. Thank goodness the present <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">justice minister</Affiliation> is totally supportive of that program, thinks it is a good idea and ultimately did renew it, but the government pushed that program right to the brink. Instead of rehabilitating offenders in this way that has been so successful, those workers had to spend their time fighting the fact that their program was expiring and there would no longer be any funding. At the last moment, funding was put into the program. I hope this system is actually put in on a permanent basis so these workers do not have to keep applying for funds.</ParaText><ParaText id="870611">Our position on this is that of course we want the justice system to work effectively. Justice delayed can be justice denied, so we want sufficient justices in the system to deal with cases. We certainly want judges for the specific claims, but we would certainly like the government to take far more action to reduce crime in the ways suggested by members of all the opposition parties and all the experts who came before committee. That would actually reduce crime so we would not need to keep increasing the number of judges and have an act like this.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="No" ToCText="The Deputy Speaker" id="2277587"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="81492" Type="22">The Deputy Speaker</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="870612"> Is the House ready for the question? </ParaText>

These people feel oppressed by the railway companies. </ParaText><ParaText id="870621"> The purpose of the bill is to strike a balance. The proposed changes respond to the concerns expressed by shippers, especially grain producers in western Canada, about railway prices and services, while ensuring that the railway companies continue to have a stable regulatory environment. </ParaText><ParaText id="870622"> In addition to what I said last December, I would like to tell the House about a meeting I had with a francophone Albertan. In what is quite a rarity, we were treated to a fine presentation in French by the Alberta Canola Producers Commission—a commission that does not even have a French name. We were sympathetic to what it had to say because it represents 52,000 canola producers throughout western Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="870623"> What they want mostly from the bill—and this reflects the Bloc’s analysis as well—is the repeal of the requirement that the Canadian Transportation Agency must be satisfied that a shipper would suffer substantial commercial harm if relief is not granted. The provisions to be repealed prevent shippers from getting the relief currently provided by the act, such as the price of competing lines, which has not proved very effective. </ParaText><ParaText id="870624"> The second point is to increase the amount of notice required for tariff changes to 30 days. Shippers will therefore have another 10 days to plan for increases, which is a more reasonable amount of time. </ParaText><ParaText id="870625">The third point would allow the Canadian Transportation Agency, by order, to establish new charges and associated terms and conditions on a railway company that wants to impose unreasonable charges or associated terms on shippers. Currently, shippers cannot challenge penalties or unreasonable charges for related services and associated terms and conditions when these costs are set out in a tariff. Demurrage charges are an example of penalties, while the weighing of loaded railway cars is an example of related service. Increasingly higher fuel surcharges that are arbitrarily imposed are also a concern.</ParaText><ParaText id="870626">The fourth point would establish criteria for the agency to determine the reasonableness of the conditions which, among other things, must be commercially fair to both the shipper and the railway company.</ParaText><ParaText id="870627">The fifth point seeks to set conditions for the return of railway lines to federally regulated railway companies. </ParaText><ParaText id="870628">The sixth point deals with the publication on the Internet of a list of available sidings where cars can be loaded. </ParaText><ParaText id="870629">The seventh point would add provisions to the arbitration clause, to allow parties to refer disputes to a mediator. The grain transportation sector must have a more balanced and equitable dispute settlement system. </ParaText><ParaText id="870630">The eighth point would authorize the shippers to join together to seek arbitration when they are not satisfied with the proposed tariff changes of a railway company. Broadening the scope of these provisions to allow shippers to file a joint complaint will help them spread arbitration costs. This is one issue that was raised, namely, that a shipper could not hold his own against railway companies when the time came to produce evidence before the Canadian Transportation Agency.</ParaText><ParaText id="870631">The ninth point, which is just as important, would institute an independent review of railway services.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp><ParaText id="870632">A review is provided for and has to start within 30 days of the legislation taking effect. This review is vital to the canola industry, because it will be an opportunity to have service issues currently facing shippers subjected to an independent assessment and should produce recommendations that strike a balance between the responsibilities of shippers and those of carriers when service problems arise.</ParaText><ParaText id="870633">In a nutshell, we have also heard evidence from railway companies, which are totally in favour of a review that will promote a factual analysis of occasional and related costs incurred by grain carriers. These issues are not being addressed simply in terms of intentions or ideas. That is another important aspect of this bill. </ParaText><ParaText id="870634">I also wanted to point out that the Bloc Québécois supports the bill because it seeks to give powers under the Canada Transportation Act. </ParaText><ParaText id="870635">It is a good thing that we act on this because, in the past, we have seen railway lines abandoned. There is a need to regulate that to some extent now. Line owners operate them as they please, often hiking prices without notice.</ParaText><ParaText id="870636">One can understand from all these facts that the Bloc Québécois is very sensitive to the plight of grain producers from the Prairies and western Canada. We are also—there is no doubt about that—sensitive to the plight of Quebec producers. This is why we stand firmly in support of supply management in Quebec.</ParaText><ParaText id="870637">If the Conservative government defended the interests of Quebec producers with respect to supply management as strongly as it is currently defending those of grain carriers, that would make a great difference and would reassure our producers in Quebec.</ParaText><ParaText id="870638">I would like to remind the House of one thing: the Bloc Québécois makes no distinction between western producers and Quebec producers. Whenever we feel that the public in general is being taken advantage of by the private sector, we do not hesitate to step in and fully and constructively play our role as the opposition with the government.</ParaText><ParaText id="870639">Therefore, the Bloc Québécois will certainly be supporting this bill at third reading.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Martin (Winnipeg Centre)" id="2277595"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78531" Type="2">Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="870640">Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the opportunity, on behalf of the NDP caucus, to enter into the debate on Bill <Document DbId="3085450" Type="3">C-8, An Act to amend the Canada Transportation Act </Document> as it pertains to railways. We should note that it was known as Bill <Document DbId="2971497" Type="3">C-58</Document> in the previous Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="870641">On behalf of my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78884" Type="2">Windsor West</Affiliation>, I would like to announce today that we are in support of Bill <Document DbId="3085450" Type="3">C-8</Document>. We will be supporting it at this stage of debate because we feel that it addresses many of the valid concerns that railway shippers have over the current conditions of the Canada Transportation Act which allow for the potential abuse of market powers by the railways.</ParaText><ParaText id="870642">We should point out that it is the view of the NDP at least that at the present time the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Canadian National Railway have a virtual duopoly on shipping prices. It is a new word to me. It is not a monopoly but a duopoly. Their financial stranglehold, as it were, is choking Canadian shippers who rely on the rail system to transfer their products from the farm or the mine to the market. Currently, for those producers, transportation costs are their second or third largest cost for these bulk shippers. Under this duopolistic regime, these shippers have no alternative way to transport their products.</ParaText><ParaText id="870643">Our point is, even though there are more than 30 federally regulated railways in Canada, something I did not know until today, many rail shippers are in fact captive shippers. That is, only a single railway company offers direct service to their area. For these shippers, the rail transportation environment is not naturally competitive and in the absence of adequate legislative measures, a railway company could take advantage of its position as a monopolist in the region. That is why we are welcoming these legislative measures that will afford some protection to these captive shippers.</ParaText><ParaText id="870644">A monopolist railway would have the incentive to offer lower levels of service at higher prices, we believe, than it would under more competitive market conditions. We welcome this attention to the rail transportation system, if I might, because it brings to light perhaps a larger issue facing Canadians in that Canada as a nation made a strategic mistake 20 or perhaps 30 years ago when it chose to start dismantling our rail transportation system and putting the emphasis of freight on trucks. </ParaText><ParaText id="870645">If there is anything I have heard you, personally, Mr. Speaker, speak about in the House of Commons, it is the fact that for all kinds of good reasons, for the environment, for the cost factor, to save on fuel, we should all be trying to get the freight off the trucks and put it back on the rails to the largest extent possible so that most of its transportation, most of the distance that is shipped is shipped by rail. That will take a shift in mindset for Canadians. It will take an analysis of our whole transportation infrastructure in this country.</ParaText><ParaText id="870646"> I welcome the opportunity to debate Bill <Document DbId="3085450" Type="3">C-8</Document> today on the rail transportation system as it pertains to the Canada Transportation Act, but I also welcome and invite other members of Parliament to join in what could be a very exciting period and opportunity as we revisit the whole transportation infrastructure as an integrated network of transportation that will meet the needs of the 21st century.</ParaText><ParaText id="870647">In that light, in that context, I draw the attention of members of the House to a report that was very quietly released just a couple of days ago without much fanfare. Hardly anybody noticed, it would seem, and certainly the media did not notice. It is called the “Asia-Pacific Gateway and Corridor Initiative”, put out on behalf of or commissioned by the current <Affiliation DbId="79000" Type="96">Minister of International Trade and Minister for the Pacific Gateway</Affiliation>. </ParaText><ParaText id="870648">In terms of transportation, this is the most important piece of work that I have come across in my 11 years as a member of Parliament because it finally comes to grips with the notion that we made a policy mistake a number of years ago when we got away from railroads and started tearing up the tracks to smaller communities.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp><ParaText id="870649">God knows that with the experience in western Canada, we have not been nation building. We have been tearing up the tracks. We have been abandoning communities in terms of access to rail transportation.</ParaText><ParaText id="870650">I should recognize and again credit the authors of this brief 40 page report, one of whom, Mr. Arthur Defehr, is from Winnipeg and the owner of Palliser Furniture, which I believe is in your riding, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Jeff Burghardt and Mr. Richard Turner. This blue chip panel travelled the world and looked at efficient transportation networks, with an emphasis on Asia and on the revolution that occurred in transportation, shipping and freight, with the shipping containers and the new urgent need for Canada to get on board with handling these containers in a more effective, integrated approach.</ParaText><ParaText id="870651">The Asia-Pacific gateway is obviously looking at the ports and the terminals, but this report reminds us of the need and the potential for inland ports, for distribution terminals far away from the congestion of Vancouver and Prince Rupert. Perhaps, and I put this to the House as a member of Parliament from Winnipeg, a place like Winnipeg would be the ideal location for a great inland port.</ParaText><ParaText Interjection="e1" id="870652"><Affiliation DbId="78395" Type="2">Mr. Charlie Angus: </Affiliation>Or Timmins.</ParaText><ParaText id="870653"><Affiliation DbId="78531">Mr. Pat Martin: </Affiliation> Or Timmins, Ontario, as it were, connected by rail, of course. </ParaText><ParaText id="870654">What we are saying is we have to think outside the box. Because of congestion, a terminal such as Vancouver is not going to be able to handle the millions and millions of containers that we anticipate flowing here from Asia and containers flowing out of here back across the Pacific Ocean full of Canadian commodities for export.</ParaText><ParaText id="870655">This is going to take a rethinking of monumental proportion. This is going to take some vision. The only vision we have seen in the transportation network in the last 30 years is how to tear up tracks, not how to build them.</ParaText><ParaText id="870656">The reason I raise this today is to serve notice to the House that there is a movement afoot in the city of Winnipeg to tear up the tracks in the inner city of Winnipeg and build a great inland port on the outskirts of Winnipeg that in fact will be a state of the art shipping container distribution terminal. </ParaText><ParaText id="870657">I have seen some humdingers. I have been to Shanghai. I have been to Indonesia and seen that state of the art container distribution terminal. I have been to Vietnam, and Fuzhou, China. Those terminals do not look anything like we have seen in this country. Those container terminals are like something we cannot even imagine. But this 40 page report shows us the way. It gives us a road map. It whets our appetite to investigate the enormous potential if we want to get with it and get into the 21st century in terms of an integrated shipping system.</ParaText><ParaText id="870658">As a member of Parliament representing the inner city of Winnipeg, I welcome this opportunity. If we do tear up the tracks that have divided historically the north end and the south end of Winnipeg with all the predictable social and economic consequences which flowed from that, and put those tracks outside the city where they belong, the opportunities would be enormous. </ParaText><ParaText id="870659">From an inner city point of view, the inner city of Winnipeg desperately needs new housing stock, new green space, new recreation facilities. This would be 250 acres, a subdivision in the heart of the city. If people would just dare to dream how wonderful it could be to meet these urgent needs and also to avail ourselves of this wonderful economic development opportunity of being the terminus, taking advantage of our geographic advantage as the very centre of North America, we could be the distribution hub for the continent.</ParaText><ParaText id="870660">Let me remind members that the full title of the Asia-Pacific gateway is the Asia-Pacific gateway and corridor initiative. It contemplates the input of the shipping containers from Asia through Vancouver and Prince Rupert, from Europe and Russia through Churchill, from South America and Africa through the St. Lawrence Seaway and the Great Lakes, all of it coming toward the true geographic centre of North America, which is Winnipeg, to be received, off-loaded and redistributed on a north-south corridor.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp><ParaText id="870661">The Red River corridor goes north to south from Churchill through Winnipeg straight down to Texas, into Mexico, into South America. This is the vision of a great distribution network in which we could play a role and it starts right here. This is how these things begin, in the House of Commons with a little red report of 40 pages that was released without any fanfare. It is loaded with such potential that I can hardly convey it to you, Mr. Speaker.</ParaText><ParaText id="870662">Winnipeg has been a tale of two cities for many years. It is divided socially, economically and culturally by this great industrial scar right through the heart of our city. I am saying that we tear up the tracks, that we heal that scar, that we put in housing, green space, recreation. Let us get the tracks out of the city and rebuild a great distribution network, something that you as a railway man, Mr. Speaker, would be proud of.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Wasylycia-Leis" id="2277600"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78332" Type="2">Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="870663">Mr. Speaker, I am from Winnipeg North which is the other side of the tracks that my colleague from Winnipeg Centre is talking about. He makes a very interesting proposal to this chamber and that is to try to deal with what is often considered an unsightly barrier in our city of Winnipeg, not unlike some other cities when there are rail yards smack dab in the middle of the city. It leads not only to questionable environmental and esthetically unpleasing sights but it also divides the city into the north and the south and leads to all the stigma that is attached to it.</ParaText><ParaText id="870664">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78531" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> has been very vocal on this issue.

I was looking at a play that was written recently by a friend of mine. Bruce McManus wrote <I>Selkirk Avenue</I>, a quite well-known work. Two babushka-wearing Polish grandmas are talking on Selkirk Avenue in the riding of my colleague from Winnipeg North. One asks, “What are you doing today?” The other points at the Arlington Street Bridge and says, “I go to Canada. I go over the bridge to Eaton's today. I am going to Canada”. That is how dramatic the divide is that has developed in my city of Winnipeg, because in 1882 it was decided to run the tracks right down the centre of Winnipeg and cause that great social and cultural divide.</ParaText><ParaText id="870667">From an urban planning point of view, my colleague is exactly right. There is a host of good reasons to tear up the tracks. There have been spills, derailments and explosions many times over the years. There has been contamination and environmental degradation. It has been an ongoing challenge to build and maintain bridges, overpasses and underpasses to go over and around these huge yards. And they are huge, we are talking hundreds and hundreds of acres of rail yards.</ParaText><ParaText id="870668">Finally, we desperately need the land for new housing, more green space, more recreation space. We want to use that land in the inner city of Winnipeg properly and not have it as an industrial blight. I have no objection to industry or development, but there are appropriate places for that kind of development, and the heart and soul, the core of our city is not the place.</ParaText><ParaText id="870669">The report that my colleague made reference to, commissioned by the Minister of International Trade, opens the door. It was finished in May 2007. I am wondering why it was only released a couple of days ago. I personally have approached the minister twice asking him for copies of it because we are all waiting for it. It is what opens the door for us and contemplates clearly a series of inland ports to accommodate this massive flow that we contemplate of shipping containers from all around the world converging, I hope, at the hub of North America, the very heart and soul of the continent, which is Winnipeg, Manitoba.</ParaText><ParaText id="870670">These container terminals are an awesome thing to see when they are well designed. If someone is trying to find a container with furniture from his factory, it might be 200 rows down and 100 rows over and up high. A computerized gantry will go and find it, pick it out and deliver it to him, so that no train and no ship is waiting more than 24 hours to offload or to reload.</ParaText><ParaText id="870671">That is the kind of vision we have to have if we are serious about attracting attention and being this distribution network. The railways will pick up freight and drop off freight if they do not get bottlenecked in a downtown core. If they can get in and out in 24 hours and pick up revenue, then they will come. Build it and they will come.</ParaText><ParaText id="870672">It is just a dream. It is just a vision.

					<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Laframboise" id="2277606"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78639" Type="2">Mr. Mario Laframboise (Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="870674">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill <Document DbId="3085450" Type="3">C-8, An Act to amend the Canada Transportation Act (railway transportation)</Document>, on behalf of the Bloc Québécois. I would say at the outset that our party will be supporting this bill. Why? Because this bill, which has been discussed, amended, reworked and adjusted in committee, will provide a way to resolve a dispute that has been going on for a number of years between shippers and the railway companies—or at least, so we hope.</ParaText><ParaText id="870675"> In recent years a whole series of tariffs has developed to counteract the Canada Transportation Act, which allowed for an arbitration system for disputes about the costs of railway transportation. That was permitted by the Act. Over the years, however, the railway companies have added what they called related charges to the shipping bill, charges that included parking, transshipment, fuel price increases and customs clearance. In other words, there is a whole list of charges that shippers had no say about; they had to pay.</ParaText><ParaText id="870676"> Obviously, with respect to this dispute, Transport Canada had asked both the shipping industry and the railway industry to come to an agreement. For several years, talks were held, but no agreement between the shippers and the railway companies was possible.</ParaText><ParaText id="870677"> It is important to say this. The railway lobby has been much in evidence throughout this lengthy process. They have lobbied based on the claim that this would destabilize the entire market. It is time for this situation to end, given that shippers are having to deal with only one transporter, as is the case for a number of companies located in remote regions, in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada, where the only really decent and safe way to ship goods is still the railways.</ParaText><ParaText id="870678"> The Bloc Québécois has always come to the defence of railways. With globalization moving increasingly toward combating greenhouse gases, this mode of transportation is a good way of contributing to not polluting the way road transportation would do, for example. So the more preference we give to railways, the better it will be for the environment.</ParaText><ParaText id="870679"> That is why, in our view, it is important for this dispute to be resolved. But will this settle the entire matter? Let us look at clause 3 of this bill, which will amend subsection 120.1(1) of the Act to read as follows:</ParaText><ParaText id="870680"><LegislationQuote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">If, on complaint in writing to the Agency by a shipper who is subject to any charges and associated terms and conditions for the movement of traffic or for the provision of incidental services that are found in a tariff that applies to more than one shipper other than a tariff referred to in subsection 165(3), the Agency finds that the charges or associated terms and conditions are unreasonable, the Agency may, by order, establish new charges or associated terms and conditions.</QuotePara></LegislationQuote></ParaText><ParaText id="870681"> This is exactly what I said before. It would be possible to apply the agency’s decisions to any related tariff that did not directly impose transportation charges. The issue here is therefore the railway industry’s bad habit of billing for all the other charges so that they were not applied to transportation charges, which were subject to arbitration by the Canadian Transportation Agency.</ParaText><ParaText id="870682">Second, this bill will allow several shippers to file a joint appeal of charges. That is the objective. This bill will affect our forestry and manufacturing industries primarily in their role as shippers. These sectors are experiencing very difficult times. The Bloc Québécois is the only real party in this House to defend the manufacturing and forestry sectors. The Conservative government did not come to their defence. Rather it presented an assistance plan contingent on the adoption of a budget, without taking into account the gloom that persists in Quebec regions. This government pays no attention to the interests of citizens or of the real public, but focuses on being elected.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp><ParaText id="870683">The Conservative members from Quebec prefer to rise and defend the Conservative Party rather than the interests of their citizens. That is the choice of the Conservative members from Quebec, but not of the Bloc Québécois members. We will never hesitate to stand up in this House to defend the interests of citizens who are losing their jobs. It is not right to invest in the military, nuclear and oil sectors and to not help those losing their jobs, especially in the forestry and manufacturing sectors. That is why, once again, we will rise today to defend the interests of the manufacturing and forestry sectors.</ParaText><ParaText id="870684">This is not going to solve their problems. Bill <Document DbId="3085450" Type="3">C-8</Document> will not solve all the problems today. However, these industries have been afflicted by this irritant for many years. For too long, Transport Canada allowed businesses to do what they wanted. It is time to put an end to all tariff systems other than the one tied to transportation costs. That is what we are trying to do today by permitting the arbitration by the Canadian Transportation Agency of disputes concerning all these other charges. It is important.</ParaText><ParaText id="870685">No bill has ever had such universal support from the shipping industry. Quebec businesses were invited to appear before the committee, and they were represented by national associations, because there truly was unanimous agreement. The request was not to touch the bill as tabled, apart from a few amendments made in committee following debate. </ParaText><ParaText id="870686">So this bill represents a request from the entire shipping industry in Quebec and Canada. Obviously, part of this bill directly affects western Canada and railway transportation. </ParaText><ParaText id="870687">The Bloc Québécois will agree that disputes should be settled on a national scale. We are pleased to support this bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="870688">Once again, it is often the small details that steadily move things along. Once we have passed the bill at third reading, as we are in the process of doing, and it receives royal assent—soon, we hope—this little dispute over the other charges can be settled.</ParaText><ParaText id="870689">I repeat that this bill also addresses another issue. Several shippers will be able to submit a matter jointly to save money. Obviously, as a result, in issuing the order in accordance with the bill, the agency must take into account the following factors: the objective of the charges or associated terms and conditions; the industry practice in setting the charges or associated terms and conditions; in the case of a complaint relating to the provision of any incidental service, the existence of an effective, adequate and competitive alternative to the provision of that service; and any other factor that the agency considers relevant.</ParaText><ParaText id="870690">The agency has full latitude to take whatever measures it may deem necessary in order to settle the dispute.</ParaText><ParaText id="870691">For the railway companies, the bill aims to strike a balance. The proposed paragraph 120.1(4) provides that:</ParaText><ParaText id="870692"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Any charges or associated terms and conditions established by the Agency shall be commercially fair and reasonable to the shippers who are subject to them as well as to the railway company that issued the tariff containing them.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="870693">Once the agency hands down its decision, the railway company shall vary its tariff accordingly. This is an obligation of result. It is very important that this be done as soon as the agency reaches its decision.</ParaText><ParaText id="870694">Why this dispute resolution? It is important that the railway companies also understand that the forestry and manufacturing sectors in Quebec and Ontario are on the verge of economic disaster. In the finance minister's economic statement, the picture of the forestry and manufacturing industries showed that they had been in a recession in Quebec and Ontario for two quarters.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp><ParaText id="870695">Naturally, economists agree on this. When the situation facing the forestry and manufacturing industry is blurred by adding natural resources, which then includes oil company revenues, the problem is concealed.</ParaText><ParaText id="870696">That is what the Conservative government ultimately did. It did so in such a terrible way, by trying to suggest that the problem facing the forestry and manufacturing industry in Canada and Quebec was ultimately the same everywhere.</ParaText><ParaText id="870697">In distributing its billion dollars, the government did so per capita, that is, of course, per resident. With a minimum of $10 million per resident from the outset, Alberta has more money than Quebec to resolve the forestry and manufacturing crisis. </ParaText><ParaText id="870698">Once again, we denounce this Conservative approach, this manner of always acting in the interests of a few, rather than in the interests of the voters and citizens of Quebec.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Volpe" id="2277610"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78499" Type="2">Hon.

Finally, the subgroup reports concluded that a broader missing persons program for Canada should be examined for the feasibility of integrating missing persons services that currently exist in provincial and territorial programs across Canada with the information derived from the processing of DNA profiles from a MPI.

The CBSA also announced that it would be working on an improved complaint and compliment mechanism.  </ParaText><ParaText id="871077">Between July 2005 and June 2007, the CBSA received comments on CBSA’s commitment to fairness through a web address on CBSA’s Internet site specifically designated to receive comments on the fairness initiative.</ParaText><ParaText id="871078">During the last 20 months, the CBSA has pursued a number of activities to further develop this initiative to bring it to the point where it is ready for implementation.

creation of a client feedback form and a prototype for a national complaint reporting system, which would allow for a more nationally consistent mechanism to analyze, respond, track and report on complaints received by the CBSA.
</ParaText><ParaText id="871082">Given that the initiative evolved into the three distinct components of service commitments, client responsibilities, and a complaint mechanism, the “fairness” banner did not appropriately capture the full essence of the broadened initiative, and the expanded initiative became “CBSA’s client rights and responsibilities”.  </ParaText><ParaText id="871083">During this period, a consultative document entitled “A Guide to CBSA’s Client Rights and Responsibilities” was developed.  In addition, in anticipation of the implementation of this initiative, a full communications plan and supporting communication products publicizing the initiative and the enhanced complaints process were developed.</ParaText><ParaText id="871084">Throughout this period, feedback on the expanded initiative was sought internally, as well as from the Canada Border Services Advisory Committee, CBSAC, whose membership is drawn from a cross-section of academia, businesses and associations that would be affected by broad border management decisions.  In all cases, the proposed commitments, client responsibilities, and the anticipated complaint mechanism received significant support. </ParaText><ParaText id="871085">While CBSA senior officials have acknowledged the importance of this initiative, and significant progress has been made on this file, no final decision can be made with respect to implementation of this initiative until a source of ongoing funding is identified to support this initiative.

These goals are supported by new investments of $375 million in current and multi-year funding for conservation programs, the largest investment in conservation in Environment Canada’s history.</ParaText><ParaText id="871106">Environment Canada will continue to carry out programs and initiatives to protect and conserve wildlife and the habitat where they live. This fiscal year, the overall budget for Environment Canada’s Canadian Wildlife Service is $84.5 million, an increase of 13% from last year. This is the largest budget that the Canadian Wildlife Service has ever had, and includes salary for staff, operating funding and money for partners.</ParaText><ParaText id="871107">In September, temporarily, budget commitment approvals were moved up a higher level while a review of spending for the remainder of the fiscal year was undertaken.  Budget allocations were adjusted and work is well under way in all priority areas. Good financial management and stewardship of resources continues to be followed.</ParaText><ParaText id="871108">In response to (a), Environment Canada remains committed to the migratory bird program. The majority of expenditures occurred in the spring and summer due to the field season nature of the program.  Work on assessing data collected and developing regulations and conservation plans is ongoing. Bird surveys in high priority areas are also continuing. The department will continue to support key work to conserve wetland habitat and migratory birds through the North American waterfowl management plan.</ParaText><ParaText id="871109">The department is undertaking a review of its various monitoring activities to ensure they are efficient and necessary.  A limited number of monitoring coordination activities have been put on hold while this review is underway. Environment Canada will continue to carry out programs and initiatives to protect and conserve wildlife and the habitat where they live.  </ParaText><ParaText id="871110">In response to (b), Environment Canada continues to deliver on its commitment for species at risk. This includes support for the Committee on the Status of Endangered Species in Canada, the independent scientific body responsible under the Species at Risk Act for assessing the status of species which may be at risk in Canada. The committee is continuing to meet in order to conduct status reports and species assessments, to help inform the Minister of the Environment’s listing recommendations under the Species at Risk Act. </ParaText><ParaText id="871111">The department continues to support advisory committees which provide important advice on issues related to species at risk, including the National Aboriginal Council on Species at Risk and the Species at Risk Advisory Committee.  The Council is composed of representatives of the Aboriginal peoples of Canada, and is mandated under the Species at Risk Act to advise the minister on the administration of the act. The Species at Risk Advisory Committee is composed of representatives from non-government organizations, industry, and other stakeholders, and provides advice to the department on the conservation of species at risk.</ParaText><ParaText id="871112"> 

In response to (c), Environment Canada is continuing to work with provincial and territorial governments, aboriginal organizations and other stakeholders to develop recovery strategies for species listed under the Species at Risk Act. Recovery strategies are advice to government which set population goals, objectives and broad approaches to respond to the known threats to the survival of the species, identify critical habitat to the extent possible, and set time lines for the preparation of action plans.  As of October 15, 2007, the federal government had finalized 42 recovery strategies addressing 69 species, one action plan and two management plans. An additional 25 draft recovery strategies addressing 28 species have been posted for public comment. Critical habitat had been identified for 15 species and proposed for four others.
</ParaText><ParaText id="871113">Environment Canada is also allocating over $16 million to external partners to take action through its funding programs, including the habitat stewardship program, the interdepartmental recovery fund, the aboriginal funds for species at risk and the endangered species recovery fund, to support recovery for species at risk.</ParaText><ParaText id="871114"> 

In response to (d), support for the ongoing management of Canada’s network of protected areas continues. Environment Canada has recently realigned priorities in order to ensure the protection of its 143 national wildlife areas and migratory bird sanctuaries.  
</ParaText><ParaText id="871115">In addition to this ongoing investment, budget 2007 includes significant new investments in Environment Canada's protected areas, including $10 million over two years for the establishment of national wildlife areas in the Northwest Territories, and $3.25 million over five years for marine protected areas under the health of the oceans initiative.</ParaText><ParaText id="871116">

In response to (e), last February, the 2007 budget provided $67 million over five years to increase enforcement officers by 50%.  This signals the government’s desire to break with the past and pursue an approach to environmental protection and conservation more grounded in regulation and enforcement. Environment Canada is currently working to hire these new officers and have them in place in 2008.</ParaText><ParaText id="871117"> 

In response to (f), the mandate of Environment Canada wildlife programs is to conserve and protect wildlife species and habitat. In that regard, there are very few instances that necessitate conducting scientific projects that may have human health ramifications. In the case of avian influenza, Environment Canada’s Canadian Wildlife Service continues to treat this as high priority.

Environment Canada was the International Institute for Sustainable Development’s primary source of funding for its first decade of operation contributing $15.6 million over 10 years to its core operating costs, until 2000.  Since then, contributions to the International Institute for Sustainable Development have varied depending on how its work related to Environment Canada’s priorities.  </ParaText><ParaText id="871153">Environment Canada is currently in the third year of the current contribution agreement with the International Institute for Sustainable Development.  While the original agreement provided $1 million per year, this was reduced to $750,000 in 2007-08 to cope with the overall reductions in the department’s grants and contributions budget. </ParaText><ParaText id="871154">The Government of Canada contribution amounts to 16% of the International Institute for Sustainable Development’s overall funding; Environment Canada’s contribution represents 43% of the federal funding.

That meant the children could eat. </ParaText><ParaText id="871275">That is actually a tradition that goes back to the 1200s and even before that when the McNeils were on the island of Barra. It was a raiding base for the Vikings. The McNeil, who was the clan chieftain, claimed the right to eat before all the lords of the earth. That is an actual historical fact, not that any of my relatives ever lived in the castle. I think they pounded seaweed on the shore for a living and then were sort of unceremoniously removed from their land and sent to Cape Breton, where they had to find work. Some of them went to the coal mines, but John P. worked on the Sydney Flyer.</ParaText><ParaText id="871276"> Mr. Speaker, I know you are waiting for me to get to the punchline, but I think it all adds to the story. </ParaText><ParaText id="871277">I do not know if John P. had many great skills, but one of his skills was that he could always tell that a bootlegger was coming into Sydney. When they were coming in on the train, he would say, “A man who has a bottle of whisky in his suitcase always puts that suitcase down with just a little more care than if it was just his long johns”.</ParaText><ParaText id="871278">Of course there was not enough work for all the McNeils, so they had to move to Ontario and work in the mines. The ones who did not want to work in the mines worked on the railway, the great Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway. Part of my long, illustrious history is that my uncles, Andy and John, were porters on the T and NO Railway.</ParaText><ParaText id="871279"> My mother tells the story about their travel along that railway from Timmins to North Bay in the summer. They would load up on the car in Timmins with a ticket that would last them as far as Schumacher, which was about two miles down the road. They would have their sleeping bags and coats. Obviously they were going on a long trip. They were always terrified that someone was going to notice that their ticket was for only two miles, not for 250. My uncles knew everybody on the train and used to travel up and down the train line for free to go stay with the aunts.</ParaText><ParaText id="871280">I know, Mr. Speaker, that you are wondering what this is all leading to. It speaks to my passion and yours. I am very glad that you are in the chair because of your deep love of history and railway. I know that you will give me a little leeway to sort of draw out what exactly the point of this discourse is.</ParaText><ParaText id="871281">I would like to move forward now to the 1980s and my own interest in the railway. We are talking about the government and its vision for infrastructure. It is putting in all kinds of effort on the gateways and ports but if people ever travel across this country they have to understand that it is not just the gateways, the ports or the megaprojects that make infrastructure work in this country. It is actually being able to connect them to the various places that makes it work, which of course goes back to my family's history on the railway. </ParaText><ParaText id="871282">The railway plays an important role in connecting. We have seen over the last number of years how much of the railways have been left. In some parts of the country they are being torn up and there are other areas where we have not built the necessary infrastructure.</ParaText><ParaText id="871283">As I said, I would like to speak about the 1980s, when a famous Scottish band came to Canada. This is a true story, although I know it sounds like a joke. A Scottish band came to Canada. I think it was called Aztec Camera. The band members landed in Halifax at that great port and then flew to Montreal. They played in Montreal and then drove to Ottawa. They left Ottawa and drove along the great highway. When they got to Toronto they thought, “This is what we always thought North America was”. Then they were told, “Your next gig is in Winnipeg. There is the bus. Now drive to Winnipeg”. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="35">(1535)</Timestamp><ParaText id="871284">About 16 hours up the highway on the way to Winnipeg, a highway consisting of two lanes of traffic, moose every 10 feet, trees and no lights, the road manager looked at the driver, who was Canadian, and asked him if he could not have picked the Trans-Canada Highway to travel across the country. The driver said they were on the Trans-Canada Highway.</ParaText><ParaText id="871285"> Anyone who has driven across this country knows that long, terrible drive through northern Ontario. Northern Ontario is made up of some of the prettiest country in the world, but Highway 11, which I live on, is in a terrible state. It is the truck transportation route for this entire country. If goods have to be moved west to east, they have to be moved along that little strip of moose pasture that runs between the rocks. People in northern Ontario ask why so many trucks need to be on these two lanes of traffic when the rail line is sitting right there and half the time is empty. That is the issue in northern Ontario.</ParaText><ParaText id="871286">We need to connect the infrastructure of this country so we do not just have great port plans and great transportation links with our major trading partner, the United States. We need a forward looking plan to ensure that goods coming off container ships from the Far East can be transported across this country in an efficient, economical and environmentally friendly way. The train, of course, takes on an important light. </ParaText><ParaText id="871287">Our role in Parliament is to look at how to improve the transportation networks of this country. Bill <Document DbId="3085450" Type="3">C-8</Document> addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by shippers dependent on railway transportation. Over the years shippers have raised many legitimate concerns about how pricing is done on railways and about access to goods. </ParaText><ParaText id="871288">They also have raised concerns about the duopoly that exists right now with Canadian Pacific and CN and their ability to basically call the shots for anything that is going to be shipped in certain areas of the country. This financial stranglehold has a major effect on competitiveness and trade. </ParaText><ParaText id="871289">Many people who ship goods, whether they are agricultural products or products being shipped out of a mine's large bulk operations, are very dependent on the prices they receive from CN or CP for the cost of bulk transportation. Under a duopolistic regime, these shippers have very few alternatives to get their products out.</ParaText><ParaText id="871290">We know that there are 30 federally regulated railways in Canada, but many rail shippers are still captive shippers who are still dealing with these two big players. We need to look at how we ensure fairness in a system that does not have major competition and a system where it is not practical to bring in competition on these lines. </ParaText><ParaText id="871291">One of the changes we are looking at is a change to ensure a little fairness in pricing and how pricing is done so shippers get a fair deal, whether they are shipping grain or copper concentrates to ports.</ParaText><ParaText id="871292">The amendments to the Canada Transportation Act in Bill <Document DbId="3085450" Type="3">C-8</Document> would help address some of the shipper concerns about rail service and rates that have been raised time and time again while at the same time providing regulatory stability to the railways to encourage needed investments to keep our exporters and importers competitive in international markets. This is key. We really need to ensure that the railway system maintains a sense of strong commitment to invest. </ParaText><ParaText id="871293">As Canadians, of course, we want to invest in our railways because they do play such a vital role and they always have, the Brian Mulroney regime notwithstanding.</ParaText><ParaText id="871294"> A number of the amendments brought forward in Bill <Document DbId="3085450" Type="3">C-8</Document> were actually developed in concert with shippers who brought their concerns to Parliament. </ParaText><ParaText id="871295">We are looking at the regulatory impact of the bill. One amendment would remove the requirement for a shipper to prove substantial commercial harm before applying to the agency for certain competitive remedies. That is a fair amendment. It is unlikely to be abused because we are talking about long term customers of the railway.</ParaText><ParaText id="871296">We also need to allow shippers to jointly apply. Right now they can apply only individually for final offers of arbitration on a common matter. If there are disputes, they could be grouped together and thus would not be drawn out. A ruling could be received fairly quickly.</ParaText><ParaText id="871297">We need to give the agency the authority to establish charges or the associated terms and conditions that would apply to shippers for the movement of traffic or incidental services. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="40">(1540)</Timestamp><ParaText id="871298">This also will allow for the suspension of any final offer arbitration process if both parties consent to pursue mediation.</ParaText><ParaText id="871299">Again, these are reasonable requests that are being brought forward to actually help address these longstanding concerns. </ParaText><ParaText id="871300">It would also permit the CTA upon the complaint of a shipper to investigate charges and conditions for incidental services and those related to the movement of traffic contained in a tariff that are of general application and establish new charges or terms and conditions if it finds those in the tariff to be unreasonable.</ParaText><ParaText id="871301">Once again, I think these are all fairly straightforward and reasonable.</ParaText><ParaText id="871302">This would increase the notice period for augmentation in rates for the movement of traffic from 20 to 30 days to ensure that the shippers receive adequate notice of rate increases. Once again, when we are dealing with large bulk transport we need to have some sense of security and some sense of stability in terms of pricing if we are dealing with products.</ParaText><ParaText id="871303">It would require the railways to publish a list of rail sidings available for the grain producer carloading and to give 60 days' notice before removing such sidings from operation. Once again, if we are going to take out some of that infrastructure that people are dependent on, we have to give the shippers some advance notice so they can begin to make other arrangements.</ParaText><ParaText id="871304">We also need to ensure that the abandonment and transfer provisions apply to lines that are transferred to provincial short lines and subsequently revert to a federal railway, including the obligation to honour contracts with public passenger service providers.</ParaText><ParaText id="871305">This is a fairly straightforward and fairly technical bill in which the government is trying to bring in these amendments. As I said, it is to give our shippers some sense of fairness in a market that does not allow very large scale competition. We all know that markets with more competition are generally ones that will favour larger investment and larger use, but certainly with railway, because of the incredible cost of infrastructure and also the history, we have the two big giants. We have always had the two big giants, augmented by many smaller lines and by provincial lines. </ParaText><ParaText id="871306">In my own region, the Ontario Northland is a provincial line that runs from Hearst. It used to be by rail but now it is by bus. From the Kapuskasing-Cochrane region and actually from Moose Factory the train line runs provincially down south to North Bay, and from North Bay south it becomes one of the CN lines. We are still moving provincial goods along that line. It is still a provincial railway.</ParaText><ParaText id="871307"> It is of paramount importance in our region, because right now if we want to move out any of the goods from the mines, in particular the sulphuric acid cars that are coming out of the Horne smelter in Rouyn-Noranda and the Kidd Creek smelter in Timmins, it is superior by far to move it on the train lines.</ParaText><ParaText id="871308"> These are massive bulk operations, so the shippers need to have some security. As well, we are moving out copper concentrates and zinc concentrates from the Horne smelter in Noranda and also from the Kidd smelter in Timmins. We need some stability in regard to knowing the pricing. As for what is being forwarded in this legislation, even though it is coming in on a provincial line, as I can see from my own region and our dependence on railway traffic, these changes are practical. </ParaText><ParaText id="871309">Certainly in western Canada the rail lines play an incredible role in the movement of goods and people. As we know, when we are driving across the country and we get to one of those rail sidings when the grain cars are coming along, we can pretty much read from one end of the newspaper to the other before the train has passed.</ParaText><ParaText id="871310"> I am always thrilled to see those train cars come along. I see them coming to the port in Thunder Bay where they end the journey so the freight can then travel by boat. When we see how much can be transferred on those lines, it is truly impressive. </ParaText><ParaText id="871311">Certainly with the whole move we have seen to the container shipping system, which has actually revolutionized transportation and commercial dealings around the world, we in Canada need to make sure that our railways are in the game and are there with prices that shippers can actually trust so they choose the railway as opposed to simply putting their product onto our overstretched highways.</ParaText><ParaText id="871312">Whether it is provincial or federal, the investment in highways just has not kept up. In so much of our country, as I have said, we are dealing with two lanes of traffic, except on the busy 401 stretch. Having that massive amount of truck traffic has not been a bonus for our economy. It is costly to the taxpayer because of the impact on roads. We do have a railway system, but we need to ensure that system. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp><ParaText id="871313">Before I close I will speak a little bit about the whole vision of a national infrastructure plan. As I said, the government is focused on the terminal ports and the gateways for trade, but in order to make trade work in this country we need a vision that says infrastructure and transportation go hand-in-hand. Whether it is the port or whether it is the highway, the two lanes of thin traffic that has to cut through the Canadian Shield carrying the goods, that has to be part of the equation as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="871314">Infrastructure also goes all the way down to a vision for our municipalities. They are increasingly having to carry the burden of maintaining infrastructure that used to be provincial or federal.</ParaText><ParaText id="871315">In my little community of Iroquois Falls over 30 kilometres of public highways has just been downloaded and called local roads. There is no base in the taxation to cover off the cost of those roads so they eventually start to deteriorate. It makes it very difficult to attract business to regions when the fundamental infrastructure, whether it is roads, bridges or sewage, begins to deteriorate because the ratepayers, average citizens, are having to pay for it on their water bill or municipal housing bill because there is no provincial or federal commitment to infrastructure.</ParaText><ParaText id="871316">We have to make infrastructure a priority in the House. The infrastructure deficit being felt across our municipalities right now is affecting regions of the country to maintain a competitive ability to attract business.</ParaText><ParaText id="871317">I had wanted to speak about infrastructure because railway is part of infrastructure and I will end on that and say that we are very interested in <Document DbId="3085450" Type="3">Bill C-8</Document>. We think it is a practical bill and the kind of bill that has been brought forward because there have been consultations with many of the shipping and trade associations, including the Canadian Wheat Board. I know that might upset some of my Conservative colleagues but the Canadian Wheat Board certainly felt that there were issues dealing with grain transportation and fairness of price.</ParaText><ParaText id="871318">We spoke with the Forest Products Association of Canada. We are hauling logs through northern Ontario. I know that in northern Canada rail plays a big part in hauling our wood, our finished products and our logs.</ParaText><ParaText id="871319">The Canadian Canola Growers Association is in support of this along with the Mining Association of Canada. If are going to do large scale mineral development in this country, at the end of the day we have to ship the products out and rail, by far, is the vehicle of choice to move concentrates or finished products out of mining operations to the ports, particularly the ports on the Pacific right now because the Chinese boom has certainly fuelled a major boom in base metals. We know that is a fact in my region of Sudbury as well as Rouyn-Noranda and Timmins. The railway plays an incredible role in the movement of base metals to serve the expansion in the Far East. </ParaText><ParaText id="871320">The Western Grain Elevator Association has shown its support for the bill along with Pulse Canada and the Inland Terminal Association of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="871321">At the end of the day, we are talking about some practical amendments to the Transportation Act to ensure fairness of price and that the overall dominance of the market by the two big giants does not come at the expense of the people who need to be able to ship products, who need certainty in price so that they can make long term planning decisions and investments in the economy that will help it continue to grow in the 21st century.</ParaText><ParaText id="871322">I look forward to seeing the hon.

It establishes rules under which investment disputes between states and nationals of other states may be resolved by means of conciliation or arbitration. It also creates the international centre for the settlement of investment disputes, known as ICSID.</ParaText><ParaText id="871339">Bill <Document DbId="3085453" Type="3">C-9</Document> implements the ICSID convention for Canada. It deals with enforcement of ICSID awards for or against the federal government and foreign governments, including the constituent subdivisions designated by foreign governments.</ParaText><ParaText id="871340">The convention deals with what is commonly called the resolution of investor-state disputes. Such disputes arise in a variety of situations. For example, they can arise when a state where a foreign investor has invested adopts laws affecting the activities of the investor in a discriminatory manner or nationalizes the investment.</ParaText><ParaText id="871341">International arbitration is a recognized method for resolving disputes. It provides a way of resolving legal issues without resort to the domestic judicial process.</ParaText><ParaText id="871342">It has long been recognized that when parties to a dispute have recourse to arbitration, the result of the arbitral process ought to be recognized by the courts. Thus, for example, the awards resulting from commercial arbitration, in other words from arbitrations between business enterprises, are recognized and enforced by courts.</ParaText><ParaText id="871343">The decision as to whether to have recourse to arbitration or the judicial process is a decision for the parties to dispute. This flexibility is welcomed in many types of situations.</ParaText><ParaText id="871344">In the case of the convention being implemented by Bill <Document DbId="3085453" Type="3">C-9</Document>, one of the big advantages of having recourse to arbitration is that it “denationalizes” the process. Let me explain.</ParaText><ParaText id="871345">When a dispute arises between a foreign investor and the host country, one of the options is for the investor to pursue the case before the courts of that host country. In most cases, as would be the case in Canada, the foreign investor would benefit from a fair and equitable process; the national court would not prejudge the matter and would render a decision in conformity with the law. </ParaText><ParaText id="871346">However, in some situations this might not happen. The tribunal might favour its government to the detriment of the foreign investor.</ParaText><ParaText id="871347">The fact that the parties to an arbitration can select the arbitrators who will hear and decide the case is another advantage of the arbitral process. If the dispute involves a specialized matter, for example, petroleum exploration, or maritime issues, the ability to choose arbitrators with specialized knowledge on the subject matter of the dispute can make the entire process work much better and can lead to better decisions.</ParaText><ParaText id="871348">The arbitration mechanism established by the ICSID convention is one that is used for disputes between investors and states. The convention has been ratified by 143 states, making it one of the most widely ratified of all international instruments.</ParaText><ParaText id="871349">The distinguishing feature of ICSID, what makes it uniquely valuable, is the enforcement mechanism which this legislation will implement for Canada. The ICSID enforcement mechanism is very effective. This effectiveness contributes to the protection of the investor. ICSID's enforcement mechanism lies at the heart of the effectiveness of the ICSID convention.</ParaText><ParaText id="871350">An arbitral award from any other arbitral body is subject to review by a domestic court before it can be enforced, but an ICSID award merely has to be presented to a domestic court with a request that the court enforce it. Under Bill <Document DbId="3085453" Type="3">C-9</Document> the award must be recognized and, with this recognition, enforcement mechanisms become available immediately. Enforcement could include payments seized by officers of the court.</ParaText><ParaText id="871351">In the great majority of cases the losing party in an arbitration will pay the award of an arbitral tribunal without the need for the successful party to take any enforcement proceedings. The same is true for investor-state arbitration.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp><ParaText id="871352">In Canada, arbitral awards, including investor-state arbitral awards, are currently enforced pursuant to the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards.</ParaText><ParaText id="871353">The New York convention permits a limited review of an arbitral award by domestic courts. It allows a court to refuse to enforce an award if to do so would be contrary to the public policy. In addition, it permits a state to exclude certain subjects from the application of the convention and thus from enforcement.</ParaText><ParaText id="871354">The ICSID provides a better enforcement mechanism. It does not permit a state to exclude from dispute settlement any matter which the state has consented to submit to arbitration. The ICSID awards are enforceable as if they were final decisions of a local court. This simple, efficient mechanism guarantees better protection for Canadian investors abroad.</ParaText><ParaText id="871355">Clause 8 of the bill authorizes any superior court in Canada to recognize and enforce awards as described in the bill. The Federal Court is a superior court. The Federal Court would have jurisdiction over awards involving the Government of Canada and awards involving foreign governments or their constituent subdivisions designated under the convention.</ParaText><ParaText id="871356">In addition, the ICSID convention provides explicitly that the ICSID awards are binding between the parties and once parties have agreed to arbitration they cannot seek remedy before another body, such as courts of justice.</ParaText><ParaText id="871357">Therefore, it is not open to a foreign tribunal to refuse to enforce an award on the basis that the ICSID arbitration tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction or was not validly constituted. These kinds of issues can affect enforcement of awards other than ICSID awards, thereby delaying resolution of the dispute. The ICSID does not permit such dilatory tactics.</ParaText><ParaText id="871358">Section 7 of the bill provides that an ICSID award is not subject to any remedy by a Canadian court. Remedies thus prohibited would include appeal, review and nullification. The decision to have recourse to arbitration is entirely voluntary, but once the parties have consented to ICSID arbitration they cannot seek review in another forum, such as the courts.</ParaText><ParaText id="871359">The only review of an ICSID award, if a party to a dispute considers it contains errors, is the review process provided by the convention itself. It provides that a request for revision, interpretation or annulment of an award must be made to the secretary-general of the ICSID. This procedure allows the parties to avoid having national courts involved in assessing allegations that claim there is something wrong with an award, while at the same time ensuring the awards which are erroneous can be corrected.</ParaText><ParaText id="871360">There are numerous reasons to support Canada's adherence to the convention. It would provide additional protection for Canadian investors abroad by allowing them to have recourse to the ICSID arbitration in their contracts with foreign states.</ParaText><ParaText id="871361">It would also allow investors of Canada and foreign investors in Canada to bring investment claims under the ICSID arbitral rules where such clauses are contained in our foreign investment protection agreements and free trade agreements.</ParaText><ParaText id="871362">To date, 143 states have ratified the ICSID convention. The majority of our trading partners are parties to it, except for Mexico, India and Brazil. Ratifying the ICSID would bring Canadian policy into line with our OECD partners. In a survey conducted by the ICSID center in 2004, 79% of the respondents said that the ICSID played a vital role in their country's legal framework and 61% said that the ICSID membership had contributed to a positive investment climate.</ParaText><ParaText id="871363">We know, anecdotally, that Canadian investors are trying to find ways to benefit from the ICSID, even though Canada is not party to the convention. Firms have, for example, arranged investments through a third country that is party to the ICSID. However, such convoluted financing is not possible for all investments by Canadian investors.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="00">(1600)</Timestamp><ParaText id="871364">International investment arbitration is growing in importance. The stock of Canadian direct investment abroad in 2005 increased to a record $469 billion. As a result of the globalization of investment, the number of investment disputes has greatly increased in the last five years.</ParaText><ParaText id="871365"> ICSID arbitration has soared: only 110 ICSID arbitrations have been completed over the past 40 years but 105 proceedings are now under way. The NAFTA parties alone have faced over 40 investor-state arbitration claims since NAFTA entered into force.</ParaText><ParaText id="871366">The tremendous growth in investment and investor-state disputes has made Canada's failure to ratify the ICSID the focus of attention by Canadian businesses, the Canadian legal community and our trading partners.</ParaText><ParaText id="871367"> The ICSID regime provides several important advantages. Compared to other arbitration mechanisms, the ICSID regime provides better guarantees regarding enforcement of awards and more limited local court intervention. </ParaText><ParaText id="871368">Any arbitral award rendered under the auspices of ICSID is binding and any resulting obligation must be enforced as if the award were a final domestic court judgment. Moreover, all ICSID contracting states, whether or not parties to the dispute, are required by the convention to recognize and enforce the ICSID arbitral awards. </ParaText><ParaText id="871369">Investors often prefer to rely on such arbitrations rather than on the local courts of the country whose measures are in dispute to ensure an independent resolution of the dispute.</ParaText><ParaText id="871370">The ICSID's relationship with the World Bank assists investors in obtaining compliance with the ICSID award and its roster of arbitrators gives investors access to well-qualified arbitrators at ICSID controlled rates, with extensive experience in international investment arbitration.</ParaText><ParaText id="871371">The ICSID also provides important institutional support for litigants. The ICSID convention is a well known tool for settlement of investment disputes. Therefore, the interpretation of the convention and its usefulness are predictable.</ParaText><ParaText id="871372">Canada already has numerous links with the ICSID. Provisions consenting to ICSID arbitration are commonly found in contracts between governments of other countries and Canadian investors. The NAFTA in chapter 11, the Canada-Chile FTA and most of our bilateral foreign investment protection agreements known as FIPAs all provide for the ICSID as a dispute settlement option that can be chosen by an investor if both the state of the investor and the host state for the investment are party to the ICSID.</ParaText><ParaText id="871373">However, Canada and Canadian investors cannot benefit from this choice if Canada is not a member. </ParaText><ParaText id="871374">It is important that Bill <Document DbId="3085453" Type="3">C-9</Document> be passed in order to facilitate adherence by Canada to the ICSID convention as soon as possible.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Charlton" id="2278229"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78613" Type="2">Ms. Chris Charlton (Hamilton Mountain, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="871375">Mr. Speaker, for me this has a bit of the same feel to it as the multilateral agreement on investment did under the former Liberal agreement. I have concerns about transparency and about accessibility for people to actually participate in the process.</ParaText><ParaText id="871376">However, I guess my most important concern focuses on accountability. As I look at all of this, the decisions issued through an ICSID arbitration are binding and there are limited grounds under which the process can be appealed. They are all very narrow reasons. They include: the tribunal was not properly constituted; it manifestly exceeded its powers; there was corruption on the tribunal; there was a breach in the rules of procedure; or, the award failed to state the reasons on which it was based. These grounds make absolutely no allowances for other substantive reasons for which a sovereign state might well decide, for the benefit of its citizens, to disagree with an arbitration decision.</ParaText><ParaText id="871377">I wonder if the member could elaborate a little more on why he feels comfortable, as a member on the government side, to do this to the Canadian public, to support a process that, as I said earlier, has no transparency, no accountability and no accessibility.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Obhrai" id="2278239"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78947" Type="18">Mr. Deepak Obhrai</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="871378">Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for asking a question that many would want to ask. She wants to know why we have the ICSID convention because it is under the World Bank and it gives transparency under the World Bank rules to ensure that what she has expressed as a concern is overridden. The confidence level given by this convention is what investors are looking for.</ParaText><ParaText id="871379">However, there is a provision in the convention where the secretary-general of the ICSID can accept a request for a revision, interpretation or annulment of an award.</ParaText><ParaText id="871380">As I mentioned in my speech, this convention, as signed by 143 countries, has put international confidence in the mechanism for investment where both the investor and the government can have confidence. We cannot have confidence on one side where we can say that the investor is subjected to a government board or a court of law where he feels he did not receive justice. </ParaText><ParaText id="871381">At the end of the day, the issue is about receiving fair treatment and justice and that it is transparent. This convention provides that, which is why 143 countries have signed on to it.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Dewar" id="2278257"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78922" Type="2">Mr. Paul Dewar (Ottawa Centre, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="871382">Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to the parliamentary secretary's comments on the bill and certainly listened carefully at committee to presentations and representations by those who brought forward their opinions.</ParaText><ParaText id="871383">At committee we heard from those who are backing this bill that the sky would not fall and that productivity and investment would still continue if the bill does not pass. If we were to listen to the government and the official opposition party, we would think that this is something that we need, that this is key to Canada's success and to investment coming into Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="871384">However, what was not touched upon is the opinion of some of the provinces. I find it passing strange that the Bloc will be supporting the bill because it would actually take away, in some respects, sovereignty, particularly in the case of financial oversight from Canada. I am surprised that the Bloc would support taking decisions that could be made here in Canada and really throwing them over to the World Bank which, as we know, is situated elsewhere. That is not to mention the concerns people have had as of late in terms of transparency and accountability at the World Bank. I need not go into that narrative. It is a long one and we know the recent problems at the top.</ParaText><ParaText id="871385"> At committee we heard very clearly that notwithstanding that countries have signed on to this, this is a file that has been around for quite awhile. We also heard that this would not guarantee increased investment but that there is jeopardy in terms of handing over accountability.</ParaText><ParaText id="871386"> Why would the government, which has told the Canadian public many times that it believes in accountability in its own operations, hand this kind of process procedure over to the World Bank when those decisions should be made right here in Canada, have Canadian oversight and remain a tool that we can use? Once we sign on to this, we are handing it over to another institution and, indeed, to another jurisdiction.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Obhrai" id="2278278"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78947" Type="18">Mr. Deepak Obhrai</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="871387">Mr. Speaker, one would not expect the NDP to look at the advantages of foreign investment in Canada. The member seems to forget the other side of the coin with investment going out of the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="871388"> Over 45% of Canada's GDP is based on imports and exports. We are a trading nation. We need prosperity. We need mechanisms that not only provide for foreigners to invest in Canada but provide Canadians with the opportunity to invest overseas as well. That is the way our country prospers. We need mechanisms in place that would give confidence to both sides of the coin. </ParaText><ParaText id="871389">The NDP would never want that. The NDP wants Canada to live in a cocoon of its own. I am happy to say that is not what Canadians want. That is not what the Canadian business community wants either. With 143 states signing, this gives confidence now.</ParaText><ParaText id="871390"> It is surprising to me that NDP members are today saying that they have no confidence in the World Bank because they are known as the biggest supporters of the World Bank. At the end of the day, those members want development and all these things. The World Bank is one of the institutions that does that.</ParaText><ParaText id="871391">We do have dispute mechanisms in other areas. As I alluded to in my speech, this is one of the best dispute mechanisms and it would give investor confidence to both sides of the business community.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Priddy" id="2278285"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78702" Type="2">Ms. Penny Priddy (Surrey North, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="871392">Mr. Speaker, transparency is one of the things the public is particularly concerned about not only in this agreement but with government processes in particular. People tell me that they have no idea what is going on, that they do not know how to get information and that the information seems quite secretive. </ParaText><ParaText id="871393">There will be no transparency in this process because the agreements will not be released to the public. The public will not know how the agreements are awarded. If we are interested in transparency or in making a cogent decision, it is interesting to note that there is no allowance for third party, or amicus curiae as the document refers to, to get more information on a decision about to be made. </ParaText><ParaText id="871394">The bill states that once the consent of a party is given it cannot be revoked. I understand the need for stability and that consent is not given lightly because many things may be dependent upon that. However, it is very worrisome to say that under no circumstances, no matter what happens, consent cannot be revoked. We are not always able to foresee the future. We are not able to say that it will always be fine under these circumstances, that this will be a very binding agreement.</ParaText><ParaText id="871395">Decisions about how the awards are made will not be available to the public. These decisions will affect the public both here in Canada and abroad in a variety of ways. For the public not to have access to this kind of information because of the lack of transparency is a problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="871396">Could the parliamentary secretary perhaps describe why no information about the awards should be made available to the public under any circumstances? </ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Obhrai" id="2278306"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78947" Type="18">Mr. Deepak Obhrai</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="871397">Mr. Speaker, this dispute is between two parties that have agreed to go in front of an arbitration tribunal. Therefore, it is important to recognize that when two parties go there, they decide what they would like to discuss and how, and they like to keep their affairs out of the public domain unless it is part of a public policy issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="871398">When an investment is made, the laws of the country are always maintained. As the Parliament of Canada, we create the laws as to how companies will operate in Canada. Any investment that comes into our country will be required to operate under our laws as made by Parliament. That will never change. </ParaText><ParaText id="871399">The arbitration tribunal will not override the laws of our country. It will only make decisions based on a dispute mechanism for reasons of investment, but our laws, as established by the Parliament of Canada, will be protected.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Wilfert" id="2278309"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78627" Type="2">Hon. Bryon Wilfert (Richmond Hill, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="871400">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill <Document DbId="3085453" Type="3">C-9</Document>. It is interesting that the government introduced the bill to promote cross-border investment at a time when it has shown a complete lack of understanding and, indeed, incompetence when it comes to this very issue. Nevertheless, the bill would create a set of rules for mutually agreed upon arbitration, which is important, for hearings between investors and foreign governments. </ParaText><ParaText id="871401">There is no question that 156 countries have signed on to this and over 144 now have ratified this agreement. Therefore, it is important that Canada be one of those, considering some of our major trading partners, including the United States and Japan, have signed on to it.</ParaText><ParaText id="871402">There is no question, though, that the government, in doing this, has nevertheless mishandled parts of the economy, as we have seen. We look at the forestry industry as a good example. We look at the manufacturing sector. Clearly, we need to be aggressive in international markets. It is important that our investors have certainty in terms of the investment climate, the investment regime when they are investing abroad. The vast majority of countries, as I said, have signed the ICSID. Therefore, it is incumbent upon Canada to do so.</ParaText><ParaText id="871403">There is no question that increased trade with countries such as China is important and that we have a governing structure that meets the demands and the needs of Canadian investors abroad. They need to have that assurance with regard to an arbitration mechanism. There is no question it is important that we protect and enhance the rights of Canadian investors.</ParaText><ParaText id="871404">The ICSID convention is an international instrument sponsored by the World Bank. There may be some members who have concerns about that. I do not. In 2006 the transparency aspects of the governance procedures were toughened. It is important to facilitate the increased flow of cross-border investment, something that we know all too much about in this country. </ParaText><ParaText id="871405">The convention certainly establishes a mechanism which gives that assurance to Canadian investors, something the investment community has demanded for a while. They believe it is important for them in order to do business, and on this side of the House we agree.</ParaText><ParaText id="871406">It is also important that we have dispute mechanisms because of problems we have seen in the past. Some countries want investment but are not prepared to provide the kind of investment regime that is stable and that provides the rules of the game for investors. </ParaText><ParaText id="871407">We cannot encourage people to invest abroad in a particular sector if we are not sure if that investment is protected. We have seen cases of nationalization. These are concerns. We have seen problems in Indonesia when we had the situation with Manulife. To deal with that, it was taken to the supreme court in Indonesia.</ParaText><ParaText id="871408"> Having a stable investment regime is important. Having a mechanism to deal with arbitration is critical.</ParaText><ParaText id="871409">This has been around since 1966. It is interesting that of the 143 countries that have ratified those instruments, many of them are our major trading partners. We need to be in lockstep with them to ensure we are on the same playing field.</ParaText><ParaText id="871410">Investment disputes are brought under the convention and are administered by the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes in Washington, D.C. Its activity has increased over the last number of years. At one time it only handled 110 arbitrations in total for 40 years, but as more and more countries have come on board, it is currently dealing with about 105 disputes at the present time. It is obviously a mechanism that people are using. It is a mechanism in which people believe. It is a mechanism that this side of the House supports.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp><ParaText id="871411">Obviously the centre was established in the very beginning to provide a reliable and effective instrument for resolving investment disputes. I think that is the one thing that we heard at committee. That is the one thing we continually hear: that this gives certainty and that it is the kind of thing the investment community certainly wants to see.</ParaText><ParaText id="871412">Once this is ratified, it will allow Canadian investors abroad to go out and make contracts with foreign states. They have that option. If they want to go to the ICSID convention, they can do that. It is an option they will have under this agreement.</ParaText><ParaText id="871413"> As well, Canadian investors doing business in a country in which Canada has a foreign investment protection and promotion agreement will have recourse to this arbitration for violators of the agreement. Again, this is providing assistance in that regard.</ParaText><ParaText id="871414">I think probably the most important advantage is the enforcement of arbitrary awards. Again, this is something that the committee heard about. Again, it is something that we believe is important. Unlike awards issued by other arbitrary institutions, domestic courts cannot refuse to enforce these decisions that are issued under the ICSID. That is important.</ParaText><ParaText id="871415">Such awards are enforceable in any country, which is important to underline. It can be enforced in any country that has ratified the convention. I think that makes it extremely important for investors and it is why we need to be part of this. When the final judgments are made, they are enforced.</ParaText><ParaText id="871416">Canada signed this convention in December 2006. In our federation, British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nunavut, Ontario and Saskatchewan have already adopted their own implementing legislation. I think it is important that, again in concert with the provinces and the territories, we move forward on this legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="871417">When it comes to investment, the international community is very competitive. If a company is going to make a major decision to invest abroad, it needs to have that certainty. As a country, I think we certainly want to encourage good investment. We want to make sure that when our investors are abroad they are not going to be held to ransom or made hostage to arbitrary changes in government policy abroad. </ParaText><ParaText id="871418">That is why so many countries have signed on. They believe this is an effective way to go and that it does provide the kind of assurance we need. Certainly on the issues of transparency, the committee heard how that was strengthened. At times, I think, it is important to be part of these international conventions, these international covenants, in order to provide the kind of security we need.</ParaText><ParaText id="871419">Clearly when countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan sign on, it is important. Japan has the second largest economy in the world. The Japanese are signators. Japan is a very important market for Canadian business. We often overlook Japan and think about China, but Japan has an economy greater than that all of Asia combined, including China. Again, we have tremendous opportunities in Japan.</ParaText><ParaText id="871420">There may an opportunity down the road to look at a free trade agreement with the Japanese. The Japanese have become very aggressive lately in signing deals with the Philippines and Mexico, countries with large agricultural sectors. For the Japanese, the agricultural sector is very sacred, yet they have been able to come to agreements with those two countries.</ParaText><ParaText id="871421">The Japanese are watching Canada's negotiations with South Korea very carefully. Obviously we have issues to deal with, not only in the agricultural sector, and certainly in the automotive sector. Of course, our party has made it very clear that we do not want a deal at any price. We want to make sure that our automotive sector has the kind of ability to go into the South Korean market that we see others enjoy, certainly in terms of what the Japanese are doing here. The Japanese are investing in Canada in the automotive sector and the South Koreans are not. Therefore, we cannot do that.</ParaText><ParaText id="871422">It is important that the Japanese have signed on. The Germans have signed on. The French have signed on. Again, all of these countries have signed on because they realize how important this convention is. For those of us who understand those market conditions, it clearly is important that we are part of this, so we will support the government on Bill <Document DbId="3085453" Type="3">C-9</Document> when it comes to passage of this legislation.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp><ParaText id="871423">Obviously we are concerned that Mexico, India and Brazil have not yet signed on. Again, the need to continue to encourage them to be part of this international convention is important. It is important to look at the benefits for their investors, as well as ours, as we move forward in this regard.</ParaText><ParaText id="871424">In terms of its international participation in promoting Canadian companies, the government has had a checkered past, but at least this bill will provide rights for our investors in other jurisdictions. At least on this issue, the government has it right.</ParaText><ParaText id="871425">Unfortunately, the government still does not understand the problems that our own domestic sectors are having, particularly in the forestry, the manufacturing and the auto sectors. These are issues that this party, the Liberal Party, has articulated for a long time.</ParaText><ParaText id="871426"> Clearly because of the good management of previous Liberal governments, we were able to leave an impressive cupboard in terms of the economic tools that the government has been able to use over the last couple of years. The Conservatives did not do it. It was the Liberal government, working with Canadians, that was able to eliminate the $42.5 billion deficit it inherited from the Conservatives and that was able to make us the only G-7 state paying off our national debt. That is a very impressive record. </ParaText><ParaText id="871427">When the Conservatives talk about the last 13 years, the last thing they want to talk about is the last 13 years of good Liberal economic management. That is okay, because we know and Canadians know the economic record of this country.</ParaText><ParaText id="871428"> We know what is important in terms of dealing with the business community abroad. That is why we will support this legislation. We believe very strongly that good fiscal tools at home and good investment tools abroad obviously are good for Canadians. They will promote jobs and they will secure jobs. We believe very strongly that this is the way to go.</ParaText><ParaText id="871429">I would suggest that at the end of the day, when presumably this legislation is adopted, the rules of the game will be very clear. They will be helpful. We should see an increase in people wanting to invest and also of course in encouraging other countries to invest here, because the rules work both ways for those who have signed on. Again, we are looking at 144 countries that have ratified this particular convention so it is something that we see as important.</ParaText><ParaText id="871430">Of course on this side of the House we believe in sound economic principles and obviously we are prepared, when we see good legislation come forward, to work with the government on it. Obviously if there is bad legislation we are not going to support it, but there is no question that in the standing committee we heard very clearly the need for this legislation and the rationale for it. Again, we will support this legislation as we move forward. </ParaText><ParaText id="871431">I take it that there will not be support from some of the parties in the House, but nevertheless I think that at the end of the day Canadians will be supportive and appreciative of the fact that the right thing was done and the rules have been made very clear on arbitrational issues. I think that is what is needed and we support it.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Angus" id="2278405"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78395" Type="2">Mr. Charlie Angus (Timmins—James Bay, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="871432">Mr. Speaker, I thought my hon. colleague's speech was fascinating. It actually fits in very well with an article I was reading in the <I>Winnipeg Free Press</I> today. The headline is: “Grits? Conservatives? Same thing. Poll says Canadians find the two major parties interchangeable”. According to the Canadian Press Harris-Decima survey, Canadians “view the two main political competitors--the Conservatives and the Liberals--as interchangeable”.</ParaText><ParaText id="871433">If we want proof of that, we only have to listen to what we hear from over there. Of course it was the Liberals as the champions of free trade who told us we would have clear investment rules with NAFTA. What we ended up with were secret tribunals under chapter 11. </ParaText><ParaText id="871434">I will bring forward the example of Metalclad, the company that went after the Mexican government because it felt that its right to dump toxic waste in a neighbourhood in Mexico was violated. Of course the Liberal Party thought Metalclad's position certainly was violated because it was a corporate investor. </ParaText><ParaText id="871435">Even though a municipal government, working with the state government and the federal government to protect its citizens, came forward with legislation to stop this toxic dumping, Metalclad had the ability to go before the chapter 11 tribunal, which is similar to what is being proposed with the kangaroo court at the World Bank, where there was an unaccountable forum, where the community and the country could not even bring legal depositions before it, and where the appeals process does not exist.</ParaText><ParaText id="871436"> I love this: at the World Bank, it is going to be secret. It does not even have to tell people when they have been stuck in the back so of course the Liberal Party loves this. This is the Liberals' idea of free trade. It fits in perfectly with the Conservatives' idea.</ParaText><ParaText id="871437">I have a question for the member. Why do the Liberals not just join up with the Conservatives? They certainly have the same view of the World Bank, which is already a discredited institution in terms of development. They would allow unaccountable, hidden tribunals to go forward with no right of appeal. What does that say for the people of this country?</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Wilfert" id="2278414"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78627" Type="2">Hon. Bryon Wilfert</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="871438">Mr. Speaker, the one thing that Canadians will never confuse is the fact that there are only two parties in the House that could be in government and that certainly will not be the member's party. There is no question that when it comes to understanding the economy and investment, it is not that party in the corner.</ParaText><ParaText id="871439">Obviously the member was not listening. There is no question that when it comes to sound economic policies and understanding them, it was this side of the House, the Liberal Party, in conjunction with Canadians, that was able to turn what was considered by economists and others a basket case in 1995 into an economic marvel. The fact is that we paid off the national deficit and we were paying down the national debt.</ParaText><ParaText id="871440">The only similarity with the present government in power is that it is simply carrying on the good policies of the Liberal Party in terms of paying off the national debt. That is something the NDP does not know. The NDP is the party that one day stands in the House and says we should spend $5 billion and the next day says we should cut $2 billion. Mathematics is not the forte of the New Democratic Party, so it is understandable that when it puts two and two together and get five those members think that is okay. This side of the House does not believe that.</ParaText><ParaText id="871441">Let us go back to the point the member was making. In April 2006 the ICSID brought in reforms for transparency: open hearings. Maybe it is okay to have activities at the Montebello in a closed session, I do not know, but on this side of the House we believe in transparency. That is what was brought in: open hearings. Of course there are some caveats when dealing with specific business information, but in general the hearings are open and transparent. The member can read about the changes that occurred in April of 2006. They were established in response to the very issue that the member raises. </ParaText><ParaText id="871442">Again, Liberals do not support anything which would be done in the backrooms. We believe in transparency and accountability. If the member is suffering from any delusion that his party is ever going to be government, he obviously has consulted Tinkerbell.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Priddy" id="2278422"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78702" Type="2">Ms. Penny Priddy (Surrey North, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="871443">Mr. Speaker, I am interested, to say the least, in the comments that the member has made, the first one being that it will only ever be the Liberals or the Conservatives that are government. Talk about entitlement, that somehow this member has said that this is an entitlement, that there could only be two parties ever in Canada. I would suggest that perhaps not all Canadians would like their vote nullified and removed.</ParaText><ParaText id="871444">The other piece I was concerned about was the member talking about following the good policies of the Conservative government. Sometimes it is hard to tell because when members are sitting down during a vote, it is a little hard for me to know whether they are following or not following the policies of the Conservative government.</ParaText><ParaText id="871445">However, this is a secret tribunal and not every arbitration is secret as we heard argued earlier by the parliamentary secretary. These are secret. There is no access by the public to the results of the arbitration at all, so I do not know how anyone could argue that these are not secret tribunals and the information is therefore not kept secret afterward.</ParaText><ParaText id="871446">I would like to hear the member describe why he would not describe this as a secret tribunal if only the two parties and the people in the World Bank are the only individuals who are allowed access to that information.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Wilfert" id="2278428"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78627" Type="2">Hon. Bryon Wilfert</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="871447">Before I directly answer that question, Mr. Speaker, I would point out that for a party that has attacked the government for saying it is the “new government of Canada”, the New Democratic Party has been around for about 40-odd years and it is still only at 29 or 30 members. I would suggest that the reality at the moment is that the only two parties that seem to be realistically looking to form a government are the two here.</ParaText><ParaText id="871448">However, on the question of entitlement, those party members think they are entitled to make all sorts of statements that are not based on fiscal reality and yet expect people to buy them.</ParaText><ParaText id="871449">In answer to the question, maybe the member should go to the website. If the member went to the ICSID website, she would find that all awards by the tribunal are posted. So, I am not sure what the problem is. If the website posts all details of the awards, the information is there. It does require turning on a computer. It does require that one finds the website and it does require that one reads it. But beyond that, all the information is there.</ParaText><ParaText id="871450">I would suggest that this is accountability. It is very useful obviously, people are going to look at that. If the member does not have the website, I would be more than happy to share it with her later, but it is important not to suggest or mislead Canadians that somehow this is all done behind closed doors. There is a process. </ParaText><ParaText id="871451">I have made it very clear what that process is and from that perspective, that information is on the website in terms of all of those awards. Access to those awards is there. That is something we would expect, Canadians would expect, and it is there. Beyond that, I do not know what else to say.

I have the blues from committee in my hand and on the question of transparency, indeed there were changes made and proposed April 2006. What is important to note, and I asked the very question in committee to a witness, is that there are a couple of changes. In April 2006 the information I had suggested regarding <I>amicus curiae</I> briefs was not allowed and now the member is saying that has changed.

Now, the question is how much longer we will be together here for this session. Because of the Conservative government's insensitivity towards the crisis in the manufacturing and forestry industries, which we will debate during the late show this evening, as you said, Quebeckers are becoming more and more outraged with this government. Obviously, when the time comes to make important decisions, we will be here to defend the interests of Quebec, as we always have.</ParaText><ParaText id="871459">The Bloc Québécois supports passing Bill <Document DbId="3085453" Type="3">C-9</Document>. Passing this bill will finally enable Canada to ratify the convention on the settlement of investment disputes between states and nationals of other states, and also to become a member of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, or ICSID.</ParaText><ParaText id="871460">Bill <Document DbId="3085453" Type="3">C-9</Document> integrates the requirements of the international convention in the laws of a country, in particular to ensure that arbitral awards are respected and to provide for the immunities required by the centre and its staff. ICSID is responsible for arbitrating disputes between States and foreign investors. There may be two types of disputes: disputes related to compliance with bilateral foreign investment protection agreements and disputes related to agreements between governments and foreign investors. The Government of Quebec regularly signs the latter type of agreement when eliciting foreign investment with the promise, for example, of providing electricity at an agreed price.</ParaText><ParaText id="871461">Canada's membership will not have any impact on the provinces, except that they too may have recourse to the ICSID when they conclude agreements with investors. The only thing that Canada's membership in the centre will change is that Canada will be able to intervene in negotiations to amend the convention or the rules of the centre and it will enjoy the assurance of being able to join in the appointment of arbitration tribunals. </ParaText><ParaText id="871462">Ultimately, the ICSID is a tribunal. The problem is not the tribunal or membership in the tribunal. The NDP member asked earlier how the Bloc Québécois could support Bill <Document DbId="3085453" Type="3">C-9</Document>. Fifty-six countries are now part of that agreement. That is not the problem. Rather, the problem lies in the poor investment protection treaties that Canada concludes and continues to conclude despite the bad examples we have seen, particularly—and I will come back to this later in my speech—concerning chapter 11 of NAFTA.</ParaText><ParaText id="871463">The Bloc Québécois supports the conclusion of investment protection agreements, as long as they are good agreements. It is completely natural for investors, before making an investment, to try and make sure they will not be divested of their property or that they will not become victims of discrimination. This is the sort of situation that foreign investment protection agreements are meant to cover. </ParaText><ParaText id="871464">In most cases, investors themselves can submit disputes to an international tribunal, but only once they have obtained the state's consent. However, in the investment protection agreements they have signed, only two countries, Canada and—guess which other country—our friend, the United States, systematically give investors the right to apply directly to the international tribunals. That is a problem, I would even call it a deviation from the norm. By allowing a company to operate outside government control, it is being given the status of a subject of international law, a status that ordinarily belongs only to governments or states.</ParaText><ParaText id="871465">The agreements that Canada signs contain a number of similar deviations that give multinationals rights they should not have and that limit the power of the state to legislate and take action for the common good. I was speaking about chapter 11 of NAFTA, which unfortunately is now well known. This chapter of NAFTA on investments provides that a dispute can go to ICSID. That chapter is a bad agreement in several respects. I will give you some examples.</ParaText><ParaText id="871466">The definition of expropriation is so vague that the slightest government action, other than a general tax provision, can be challenged by a foreign investor if it reduces its profits from its investment. Take, for example, the plan to implement the Kyoto accord, which would heavily penalize big polluters and oil companies and could be challenged under chapter 11 and result in the government paying compensation. The Alberta oil companies are in fact mainly owned by American interests. Chapter 11 opens the door to the most abusive proceedings. </ParaText><ParaText id="871467"> Furthermore, the definition of investor is itself so broad that it includes any shareholder.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp><ParaText id="871468">Therefore anyone could take the state to court and attempt to obtain compensation for a government measure that allegedly reduced a company's profits. </ParaText><ParaText id="871469">As for the definition of investment, it too is so broad that it even includes the future profits that an investor hopes to earn, even though this is only a projection. In the case of expropriation, not only does the state find itself forced to pay fair market value, but it must also include revenues that the investor expects to earn in future. It would no longer be possible to nationalize electricity, as Quebec did in the 1960s.</ParaText><ParaText id="871470">We can look at situations that have occurred over the years. For example, SunBelt, a corporation with a Canadian shareholder and a Californian shareholder, closed its doors when the Government of British Columbia withdrew the right it had granted for the bulk export of water. The Canadian shareholder, based on Canadian laws, received compensation equivalent to the value of his investment, or $300,000. The American shareholder, based on NAFTA chapter 11, included potential future revenue from the sale of water in its claim: $100 million. We do not know the full story, because the case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount, but we can see just where abuse can lead.</ParaText><ParaText id="871471">As an aside, that is what prompted the Bloc Québécois to present a motion to ensure that, in light of NAFTA, water is not considered a commodity and that it cannot be sold in bulk, as the Americans would like. We do not want to lose this great wealth of Quebec and we do not want this to become a shameless object of trade.</ParaText><ParaText id="871472">Given the amounts of money at issue, chapter 11 discourages any governmental measure, when it comes to the environment in particular, that would decrease the profits of a foreign owned company. </ParaText><ParaText id="871473">The dispute settlement mechanism currently allows companies to turn directly to international tribunals to seek compensation without the need for the state's consent. I was talking about that earlier. This is a serious problem. A multinational could, on its own authority, be behind a trade dispute between two countries. That could happen the way things stand now. It is that type of absurd situation that chapter 11 of NAFTA on investment allows.</ParaText><ParaText id="871474">The government must enter quickly into discussions with its U.S. and Mexican counterparts to amend chapter 11 of NAFTA. The Bloc Québécois has been calling for that for a very long time now. We have seen the abuses that have resulted from this. Instead, the government is adding more agreements and, in those agreements, we find a carbon copy of chapter 11 of NAFTA.</ParaText><ParaText id="871475">In addition to chapter 11 of NAFTA and despite the fact that everyone has criticized its abusive nature, the government has concluded no less than 16 other bilateral foreign investment protection agreements that, as I was saying, are carbon copies of chapter 11 of NAFTA. All these foreign investment protection agreements are bad and should be renegotiated.</ParaText><ParaText id="871476">The Bloc Québécois is calling for more transparency, more democracy. The government must submit to the House all international treaties and agreements before ratifying them. That is another problem that should be discussed more broadly here, in this House. We must also ensure that the public realizes that many international agreements can be concluded in secret.</ParaText><ParaText id="871477">For example, earlier this year, the government announced in a news release that it had signed a new investment protection agreement with Peru. That was how we found out about the agreement. Parliamentarians and the general public knew nothing about the agreement until they read the news release. Moreover, not many members of the media gave this story a very high profile. Parliament was never informed, nor did Parliament approve it. This is totally undemocratic. The strange thing is that we have before us a government that boasts about keeping its promises. It says that it follows through on the promises it makes. I would like to remind members of this House, the general public, and especially the government that that is not true. The government does not always do as it says it will. It does not always keep its promises. The Conservatives' election platform during the last campaign was very clear. The Conservatives promised to submit for approval all international treaties and agreements before signing them. That is not what has been happening. Since the Conservatives came to power, Canada has signed no fewer than 24 international treaties.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp><ParaText id="871478">With the exception of one single amendment to the NATO treaty that was the subject of a last-minute debate and vote here, none of these treaties were brought before the House. So much for that promise, which the government casually dismissed.</ParaText><ParaText id="871479">These days, international agreements can have as great an impact on our lives as laws. Nothing can possibly justify the secretive, unilateral ratification of these agreements by this government or any government without the participation of the representatives of the people.</ParaText><ParaText id="871480">People do not send us here for nothing. We often have to explain what the federal government is up to, a government that, it must be said, seems more remote than municipal governments or the National Assembly and other provincial governments. We explain what we do, the bills we pass and so on.</ParaText><ParaText id="871481">People understand that international trade and foreign affairs fall largely under the jurisdiction of the federal government. It is our job to take care of such things here. Yet, as I just explained, the government has been signing most of its international agreements without giving us a chance to vote on them. </ParaText><ParaText id="871482">As usual, we Bloc Québécois members are taking action. Some claim that we merely talk, but the fact is that we also act. We have introduced bills to restore democracy and ensure the respect of Quebec and provincial jurisdictions in international treaties. I will get back to this later on. We presented a bill on this issue on three different occasions.</ParaText><ParaText id="871483">Today, we can see that the Conservatives' word is not worth much. It is not worth anything, particularly in this area. This is why the Bloc Québécois will raise this issue again and will bring forward proposals to restore democracy in the conclusion of international treaties.</ParaText><ParaText id="871484">We want the government to be required to present to the House all international treaties and agreements it has signed, before ratifying them; to publish all international agreements by which it is bound; to allow the House to vote on and approve such agreements, following an analysis by a special committee tasked with examining international agreements and major treaties, before the government may ratify them; and, of course, to respect Quebec and provincial jurisdictions in the entire process of concluding treaties, that is at the negotiation, signing and ratification stages. </ParaText><ParaText id="871485">While the provinces are usually informed of negotiations relating to trade agreements, in reality they have little say in the process, except on rare occasions; they are completely excluded from the decision-making process. </ParaText><ParaText id="871486">Now, democracy is totally absent when it comes to international treaties. There is no complete list of treaties. The government releases them sporadically. We do not know when it will release them, or even if it will release all of them, because it is not bound to do so. Even the Department of Foreign Affairs' treaty branch does not have a list or report that we could consult to find out with whom, when and why the government signed this or that treaty.</ParaText><ParaText id="871487">Nor is the government required to table these documents in the House. In fact, it is not even required to inform the House or the public when it signs or ratifies treaties.</ParaText><ParaText id="871488">The House does not approve them. As we mentioned earlier, the government can sign and ratify treaties, it can do anything it wants without consulting the public's representatives. At best, if ratification of a treaty requires changes to the legislation, Parliament will be asked to vote on such legislation. Incidentally, since 2002, in Quebec, the National Assembly must vote on these measures.</ParaText><ParaText id="871489">Since the House is in no way involved in the process for concluding treaties, it cannot consult the public. This is really pushing the denial of democracy, especially since, as some colleagues mentioned, these types of treaties affect everyone in their everyday lives. </ParaText><ParaText id="871490">The government is not required to consult the provinces either. The government prevents the provinces from acting internationally by controlling their international relations and not permitting them to conclude agreements that are considered treaties.</ParaText><ParaText id="871491">This is what is going on now. What is ironic is that Canada is less democratic than it was in the 1920s. In fact, in June 1926, Prime Minister King moved a motion, which was unanimously adopted by the House of Commons, which stated:</ParaText><ParaText id="871492"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">—before Her Majesty's Canadian ministers recommend ratification of a treaty or convention involving Canada...Canada's approval must be obtained—</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="871493">That was 1926. This is 2008.</ParaText><ParaText id="871494">In 1941, Mackenzie King reiterated his commitment to this formula. To quote him once again:</ParaText><ParaText id="871495"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">With the exception of treaties of lesser importance or in cases of extreme urgency, the Senate and the House of Commons are invited to approve treaties, conventions and formal agreements before ratification by or on behalf of Canada—</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="55">(1655)</Timestamp><ParaText id="871496">Over the years, we have resorted less and less to approval by resolution. For example, during the cold war, the practice of obtaining Parliament's approval for signing treaties or for military intervention abroad was definitely abandoned. We even stopped tabling treaties in Parliament, with the exception of the Kyoto accord, which is more recent. No treaty has been approved by resolution since the 1966 Auto Pact, more than 40 years ago. </ParaText><ParaText id="871497">In the case of Kyoto, the government is refusing to respect what was voted in Parliament. I am laughing and sometimes we laugh about things that are not funny. That is the case here. It is the irony of the situation. Once again we could call this a denial of democracy. </ParaText><ParaText id="871498">In addition, if we compare ourselves to other countries, Canada is less democratic than the rest of the industrialized world. Parliamentarians in most of the other major industrialized democracies participate more fully in the approval of treaties. I will give a few examples: France, Germany, Denmark, Italy and even the United States are required, by their constitutions, to obtain legislative approval for at least certain types of international agreements before they are ratified. We still have a fair amount of work to do to establish a democracy that can deal properly with international agreements. </ParaText><ParaText id="871499">I referred earlier to bills introduced by the Bloc Québécois on three different occasions. And we will do it again. We have introduced a bill on treaties to modernize the whole process of entering into international treaties. The Bloc Québécois' bill on treaties was designed to enhance transparency and democracy when international treaties are negotiated and signed. Given that such treaties occupy an increasingly important place in the lives of our fellow citizens, a change in established practices was more important than ever.</ParaText><ParaText id="871500">In addition, the bill ensured that the legislative jurisdiction of the provinces was respected by the federal government. Understandably, we feel very strongly about that. The bill included five changes: the systematic tabling of treaties before the House of Commons, seeking the approval of the House for important treaties, consultation of civil society by a parliamentary committee before Parliament makes a decision on an important treaty, the publication of treaties in the <I>Canada Gazette</I> and on the Internet site of the Department of Foreign Affairs and, finally, the compulsory consultation of the provinces before any treaty on matters within provincial jurisdiction can be negotiated.</ParaText><ParaText id="871501">The bill on treaties made it to a vote only once, on September 28, 2005, but all federalist parties voted against it. Why? I will get to that. Never short of contradictions, the Conservatives made two promises with respect to international treaties in the last campaign. They promised to put international treaties to a vote in the House before ratifying them and to involve the provinces in the treaty process whenever treaties affected their jurisdictions. Both of these promises have been broken. Since they were elected, the Conservatives have amended NAFTA, signed two investment protection agreements modelled on chapter 11 of NAFTA, one of which was ratified, and entered into a military cooperation agreement allowing British soldiers to train in Canada. They have also signed cooperation agreements in the area of higher education, even though Ottawa does not have jurisdiction over higher education, entered into an agreement to facilitate technological transfers from Canada to China and amended the free trade agreement with Chile. With the exception of the amendment of the NATO treaty, on which we had a mini-debate and a vote at the last minute, none of these international treaties were submitted to this House. </ParaText><ParaText id="871502">I was saying earlier that the federalist parties had rejected the Bloc Québécois bill because of two clauses in particular, including clause 4, which established a mechanism for consulting the provinces. It would appear that when one belongs to a federalist party, even if they claim to be full of good intentions and that they want to remain open, and even if this is presented in an election campaign to the provinces and, more particularly, to Quebec, they seem to forget it all very quickly when the time comes to take action and to vote. Furthermore, clause 6 did not suit them. That clause recognized the validity of the Gérin-Lajoie doctrine. </ParaText><ParaText id="871503">In closing, the federalist parties rejected more than just a Bloc Québécois bill; they rejected a piece of Quebec legislation. In fact, section 22.1 of the Act respecting the Ministère des Relations internationales requires the Government of Quebec's consent, both at the signing and the ratification or adhesion of the Government of Canada, before the latter may act on the international scene in relation to any agreement that has to do with areas of Quebec jurisdiction accorded under the Constitution.</ParaText><ParaText id="871504">It should therefore come as no surprise that, with the federalist parties' rejection of this bill, more and more Quebeckers are becoming sovereignists and that we would tackle this issue again by presenting this kind of bill, which, unfortunately, clearly demonstrates to everyone that those parties are not at all open to Quebec. </ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Priddy" id="2278495"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78702" Type="2">Ms. Penny Priddy (Surrey North, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="871505">Mr. Speaker, if I had not been told earlier that the Bloc supported this motion, I would not have known that given the comments of the member.

Canadians want us to take this direction in order to trigger major changes.</ParaText><ParaText id="871519">Here is my question for the Bloc Québécois member.

As far as the last budget is concerned, I recall that all the parties in this House supported it. During the last vote, not a single NDP member stood up or said a word. The budget was passed unanimously. We are not interested in hearing any more about the last budget, especially since it was the Bloc that got $3.3 billion to resolve in part, but not entirely, the fiscal imbalance. That was a major battle Quebeckers wanted us to fight here in the House. In my riding, when I go to the grocery store, I am not embarrassed. I hold my head up high. People understand quite well the work we are doing here and they thank us for it.</ParaText><ParaText id="871522">To support a budget, tax measures or certain bills does not mean supporting a government. Where is the logic in that? I cannot imagine. The hon. member has been here longer than I have and there certainly have been times when she voted with the government. I remember the cozy relationship between her and the government of the Prime Minister's predecessor, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78571" Type="2">LaSalle—Émard</Affiliation>—he is still here, but we do not see him very often. This relationship between the NDP and the Liberals was right up front at the time and that did not mean that the NDP supported everything the Liberal government did. It did not support the sponsorship scandal or things like that.</ParaText><ParaText id="871523">We have to be consistent. Supporting this type of measure, whereby Canada becomes a member of a dispute settlement tribunal, does not necessarily mean supporting every Conservative government measure.</ParaText><ParaText id="871524">I even said from the outset in my speech that this government was insensitive about the manufacturing crisis and the forestry crisis.

It was set up in 1966. I guess it has been a bit of a late bloomer. Here we are 40 years later trying to actually give it some legitimacy.</ParaText><ParaText id="871526">I have listened to the debate and I find it interesting, but it is predicated on two fundamentally wrong principles. </ParaText><ParaText id="871527">The first is the principle that if we look at the failed processes that are in place now for trade, particularly the chapter 11 mechanisms for NAFTA, it has been proven time and time again that they allow certain corporate interests to override regional, state and national governments and the legitimate interests of governments to protect citizens in a fair manner. That has been used again and again as a blunt instrument to push a privatizing agenda against national interests. We are supposed to accept that this principle, which has failed again and again under chapter 11, will somehow be different with this tribunal, even though it is using basically all the same input mechanisms, and that things will somehow be better this time.</ParaText><ParaText id="871528">The second element in this discussion, which we are supposed to accept, is the tribunal, through the World Bank, is such an august body that it will have legitimacy in its own right. We are supposed to forget 40 years of the neo-liberal experience under the World Bank and the severe damage it has done in development.</ParaText><ParaText id="871529">Therefore, I will speak on practical issues of how trade disputes are actually dealt with in the real world so we can bring a bit of perspective to this debate. </ParaText><ParaText id="871530">I will begin with the World Bank's credibility. Certainly it has taken a number of hits because it was a dumping ground for Paul Wolfowitz, who is notorious now as one of the architects of the illegal war in Iraq. He was such a liability to even George W. Bush that the Americans could not figure a place to dump him to get his radioactive state out of Washington, so they sent him to the World Bank.</ParaText><ParaText id="871531"> Under Wolfowitz's leadership, credibility of the World Bank was severely challenged. There was an element with his girlfriend and losing complete support of the directors of the World Bank around the entire world. Therefore, there was a coup to get this guy out. Here was a guy who even George W. Bush would not be seen beside representing the World Bank.</ParaText><ParaText id="871532">I refer members to a recent article in <I>The Guardian</I> that said we should end the hypocrisies on the World Bank because the fact was the World Bank's credibility was shot long before Paul Wolfowitz brought his girlfriend on the scene.</ParaText><ParaText id="871533">Naomi Klein has written extensively about the failings of the World Bank in terms of ensuring that when we do have trade pacts and we do have development deals, that communities and national economies are able to benefit from them. She writes:</ParaText><ParaText id="871534"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">First, let's dispense with the supposed hypocrisy problem. “Who wants to be lectured on corruption by someone telling them to ‘Do as I say, not as I do’?” asked one journalist. No one, of course. But that's a pretty good description of the game of one-way strip poker that is our global trade system, in which the United States and Europe—via the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organisation—tell the developing world: “You take down your trade barriers and we'll keep ours up”.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="871535">We can see that whether it is farm subsidies or any form of international trade. She goes on to say:</ParaText><ParaText id="871536"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The more serious lie at the centre of the controversy is the implication that the World Bank was an institution that had impeccable ethical credentials—until, according to 42 former World Bank executives, its credibility was “fatally compromised” by Wolfowitz.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="871537">The truth is the bank's credibility was compromised long before Mr. Paul Wolfowitz. It was compromised when it forced school fees on students in Ghana in exchange for a loan, when it demanded that Tanzania privatize its water system, when it made telecom privatization a condition of aid for Hurricane Mitch relief and when it demanded labour “flexibility” in Sri Lanka in the aftermath of the Asian tsunami.</ParaText><ParaText id="871538">While the rest of the world was raising money in our schools, in Canada and around the world, to help the victims of the tsunami, the World Bank was putting the squeeze on Sri Lanka to break apart its national policies on protecting its own workers. The Paul Wolfowitz scandal pales in comparison to that.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp><ParaText id="871539">On the issue of corruption and accountability, she says that the World Bank has absolutely no credibility to speak of because the World Bank was there when the Soviet Union was basically picked apart by an oligarch of mafia interests. We saw the role the World Bank played in Chile with, of course, Milton Friedman, the original doctor of shock and torture for the economy, and the incredible damage that was done to all segments of society in what was actually a very middle class country at that time until the World Bank was through with it.</ParaText><ParaText id="871540">The World Bank has a lot to answer for in terms of its credibility of being a fair arbiter, an honest policeman on the world stage. I think many people in developing countries have developed a very strong distaste for that. We need to have that in mind when we talk about any trade agreements that come before us in the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="871541">The issue of trade is paramount to us as a nation. We are a nation of traders and we want fair rules. In our farming sector we have come up against incredible odds because some of our major competitors, the EU and the U.S. , continually dump products on the international markets and continually distort the price of grains and other commodities through their subsidies. It has hurt us but it has had devastating effects in the third world where y the EU or the U.S. can dump grain, corn or any other product into the third world where farmers do not have nearly the same protections.</ParaText><ParaText id="871542">When we all talk about a level playing field, it seems that they are never on the level playing field. Who is on the level playing field? Well, it is the corporations and their friends, but national economies, especially in the third world, are not on any kind of level playing field.</ParaText><ParaText id="871543">If a trade agreement comes before this House, we need to look at it through the prism of asking whether it will be fair, just, true and open trade or whether it continues to perpetuate a very one-sided cycle. Unfortunately, I believe that this one-sided cycle will continue.</ParaText><ParaText id="871544">I would like to speak to a couple of examples. It was mentioned earlier in the House the example of Metalclad in Mexico where a U.S. company felt that its rights were unfairly impinged by the fact that in its desire to use a poor neighbourhood in Mexico as a toxic waste dumping ground somehow its rights were violated by the fact that the people of that region said that certain base standards needed to be set. They said that as a municipal government, a regional government and a national government they needed to protect their country from being a dumping ground for waste.</ParaText><ParaText id="871545">Metalclad took that through binding chapter 11 arbitration. Anybody who says that the chapter 11 arbitration process is in any way fair or open is deluding themselves. They would be smoking the kind of stuff that I know our Conservatives are certainly wanting to snuff out.</ParaText><ParaText id="871546">What happened in that Metalclad decision has been repeated in numerous decisions under NAFTA, chapter 11, where basic rights of a country to set certain levels of standard have been erased by a body that is unaccountable, unelected and sets its own standards, in fact it sounds very much like the Liberal dominated Senate, but it has the ability to do worse because there is no appeal mechanism under chapter 11.</ParaText><ParaText id="871547">We are seeing a very similar setup with this World Bank front in terms of its mechanisms. Chapter 11 does not have to release the results of its findings. It does not have to allow any third party briefs to be brought forward. The ability of a national government to protect its interests once it has gone to a chapter 11 challenge becomes very limited.</ParaText><ParaText id="871548">I would like to speak about my own interest in chapter 11. We have a situation right now where the taxpayers of Canada are on the hook for a potential $350 million in damages that is being heard at a secret tribunal, a chapter 11 of NAFTA. That is being brought forward by a company 1532382 Ontario Inc. This is a company that was founded in Ontario and its board of directors is listed as being in Don Mills, Ontario. The people on the board of directors are not known to the public because they get to hide behind corporate anonymity, but this numbered company is suing the Canadian public for $350 million, claiming that its international rights were violated.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp><ParaText id="871549">I want to go through this story so people in the House and anyone watching back home will know how this kind of, as Naomi Klein said, one-way strip poker is played. </ParaText><ParaText id="871550">1532382 Ontario Inc. was incorporated in the province of Ontario to go after a municipal waste contract under provincial jurisdiction. That provincial waste contract was the 1995 original bid for picking up garbage for the City of Toronto. The solution being offered by 1532382 Ontario Inc. was to ship it up to northern Ontario to the riding of Timmins—James Bay, where we have these massive iron ore pits that are filling with groundwater, and dump the garbage for 20 or 30 years in the pits. The fact that 380 million litres of groundwater flows through those pits a year is not a problem for the planners of this dump because it was actually written into this scenario that they would use the groundwater to wash the garbage and they would get 20 years out of these pits. Three hundred and eighty million litres of groundwater would flow through for all of eternity as far as we know unless something dramatic changes in northern Ontario. The guarantee was that this numbered company with no name behind it would set up a commitment that for 2,000 years it would run pumps to wash the garbage, to take the groundwater and pump it back into the surrounding environment. </ParaText><ParaText id="871551">In fact, when the planners came before the Ontario government with this plan, they actually costed out the cost of fixing the pumps 1,500 to 1,600 years in the future. It was amazing. They figured it would cost them $25 an hour 1,600 years in the future. That is like Clovis and the Franks talking about what it would cost to run trucks on our roads back in A.D. 600. This shows how absurd this plan was. </ParaText><ParaText id="871552">This plan was so absurd that it would never have made it to first base until of course the Mike Harris government came in. My God, there are certain people here who were there at the time when Mike Harris stripped the environmental assessment laws. Since they knew a deal like this would never go through with scrutiny, they put it through the biggest waste management proposal in Canadian history through a scoped EA where they were able to omit all the questions about groundwater safety so that this dump could get passed. In fact, the only question that was allowed in the entire hearing was whether or not the numbers from the computer model matched. There was nothing about real time experience at these pits. These were badly fractured pits. People who lived underneath the pits can tell us about the problems with the water flowing through. The miners who worked in the pits knew the situation in the pits. </ParaText><ParaText id="871553">The Harris government thought this was a great deal because some of the people involved in 1532382 Ontario Inc. happened to be from the city of North Bay, which was the home base of Mike Harris. It almost came to fruition but the people of northern Ontario and the Abitibi region of Quebec came together and said that was enough. They said that they would not go through with a project that was so risky, so unproven and so potentially disastrous to the health of their region that it literally took railway and road blockades to get this government's attention that there were problems with this plant, problems that would have easily have been identified if we had a proper environmental assessment in process. The dump plant for the Adams mine fell through, which is no surprise. Sometimes really bad ideas do not fly. </ParaText><ParaText id="871554">The reason I mentioned that dump is because a very curious thing happened afterward. At the time, 1532382 Ontario Inc. was identified with Gordon McGuinty, a North Bay businessman. He had Notre Development. He had a number of investors and many of those investors were well known. Many of them were from various parts of Ontario. When he had a problem, after the deal fell through and waste management walked away, he was looking for partners for this dump, and this is where another number of investors came through. Some of those investors were also identified with the Conservative Party. People who identified names who were involved in this were all from Ontario.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp><ParaText id="871555"> I could name them here. I am not afraid to name them. Mr. Cortellucci was identified as someone who certainly seemed to have an interest in this mine. Of course it was all behind numbered companies, so how do we find out? </ParaText><ParaText id="871556">This Ontario numbered company actually donated money to the leadership bid of the present <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>. This Ontario company gave donations to the Conservative Party. It was clearly based in Ontario and it was dealing with a municipal contract. After the Adams mine deal fell through, the company sued the present Ontario Liberal government for $300 million for the fact that it was robbed of its deal. That lawsuit went nowhere so we did not hear anything more about this numbered company until last year. It was not interested in going through the Canadian courts anymore. It was taking its case to chapter 11 of NAFTA. How is it that an Ontario company that is donating money to Ontario political officials dealing with a municipal waste contract can go to chapter 11 as an international investor? </ParaText><ParaText id="871557">Lo and behold, Vito Gallo, a man nobody has ever heard of, steps out of the wings and says that he is the sole owner of this mine. I asked the Toronto city councillors who were involved in the negotiations if they had ever heard of Vito Gallo. They had never heard of him. I had to tell them that he was suing the Canadian public for $350 million claiming that he owned the Adams mine and that his mine has gone up in smoke. I was involved in those negotiations with the Algonquin nation when I worked with them and we had never heard of this man. Now he has this deal and is going before chapter 11. </ParaText><ParaText id="871558">There will be no appeal at chapter 11. We have no right to bring forward briefs about who was involved and who the potential Canadian investors were. We do not have the ability to do that. The Canadian public is trusting three guys in Washington to dispense justice on $350 million. In any kind of fair deal, as in the case of taking this dispute to a Canadian court, there would be depositions from both sides, there would be witnesses and there would be cross examinations. We would squeeze the Charmin to see if this case had any legitimacy at all. That is what the courts are there to do.</ParaText><ParaText id="871559">In a large dispute where a large amount of money is involved and where a provincial or federal law is in question, that dispute must be brought forward to be tested to ensure there is full due diligence. That does not happen with chapter 11. We have seen it time and time again where even dispute resolutions do not need to be made public.</ParaText><ParaText id="871560">How can something be transparent and open when third party briefs are not allowed to be brought forward and there is no right to full legal representation? How can something be transparent and open when a panel of three get to decide and their word is law? There is no appeal and no challenge process. If anybody tells me that is good for the business of the nation then we are certainly not on the same political wave length. I believe that certain issues need to be brought forward before any of these kinds of decisions are allowed.</ParaText><ParaText id="871561">This brings me to the World Bank's investment tribunal. I think we are dealing with many of the similar concerns that we saw with NAFTA's chapter 11. We have not seen that anyone has learned anything from chapter 11 about making these deals more open and more fair. In fact, this really seems to be just another way for the government and its friends in the Liberal Party to resurrect the multilateral investment treaty. When that treaty was brought to the public's attention, Canadians said that there were issues of national sovereignty and our economy that they were not going to give away to some arbitrary, unaccountable, unelected body to make binding decisions. That simply undermines our national sovereignty. There was a national response against the multilateral investment treaty. I know that certain people from certain ideological stripes felt the pain of losing that.</ParaText><ParaText id="871562">Under article 52, an annulment of this decision may only be allowed if:</ParaText><ParaText id="871563"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2"> (a) that the Tribunal was not properly constituted; </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="871564"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers; </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="871565"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">(c) that there was corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal; </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="871566"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; or</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="871567"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2"> (e) that the--</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="30">(1730)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Galipeau" id="2278591"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="114224" Type="92">The Acting Speaker (Mr. Royal Galipeau)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="871568">Questions and comments, the hon.

It is remarkable to me. First, I was frankly a little bit disappointed by his speech. I think one can make a point for or against something without personal attacks, being negative, smearing Paul Wolfowitz, smearing people's intentions and attacking their character. One can make the point against chapter 11 without having to attack someone's personality and character. It is entirely unnecessary and it is unbecoming in this place.</ParaText><ParaText id="871573">Beyond that, chapter 11 of NAFTA extends the Canadian value internationally. What chapter 11 says in NAFTA is that we cannot discriminate against a foreign owned company. </ParaText><ParaText id="871574">The hon. member used the example of Metalclad. What chapter 11 says is that if a municipal, provincial or federal government in Canada or any jurisdiction in the world wants to regulate or legislate against certain behaviours by any companies, say one which is dumping pollutants that may be detrimental to an environment, a government can say that companies cannot dump this pollutant. </ParaText><ParaText id="871575">It cannot say that company A cannot dump the pollutant. It has to say that all companies have to stop dumping this pollutant. The reason why is because countries very often use regulations and laws to discriminate against one company in favour of another. Chapter 11 means that we have to treat all companies equally, not discriminate, and thereby allow companies to change their practices in order to meet the new burden in the best interests of the public. It forces countries not to discriminate. That is what chapter 11 does.</ParaText><ParaText id="871576">The hon. member says that this allows companies to sue governments in order to change laws. Yes, it does. In Canada, a foreign company can sue the Canadian government or any government if it is being discriminated against. It could do that before chapter 11. Chapter 11 allows a Canadian company to sue a government in another jurisdiction so that it gets treated equally and so that it is not discriminated against. That is what chapter 11 does.</ParaText><ParaText id="871577">The hon. member says that a company can sue a government and overturn a law. Yes, because it is being discriminated against to benefit another company that may be domestically based. It is a trade barrier. It prevents competition. Preventing competition prevents people from getting the best quality, the best price and the best choices in products, and how they want to live their lives. That is a good thing. </ParaText><ParaText id="871578">The principles of chapter 11 exist in Canada whether we have NAFTA or not. NAFTA and chapter 11 of NAFTA extends this virtue abroad because it protects Canadian companies in other countries so that we can do business and not be discriminated against.</ParaText><ParaText id="871579">I cannot believe that a member can stand up in the House for 20 minutes and give a speech on something he clearly knows so little about.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Angus" id="2278595"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78395" Type="2">Mr. Charlie Angus</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="871580">Mr. Speaker, I was quite surprised. I was not sure if my smear was that Wolfowitz had been corrupt or that he had engineered an illegal war, but I know I have certainly touched a soft spot with my Conservative friend and I am not surprised he is up defending chapter 11 so blindly. That is part of the ideological problem in the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="871581">I spoke about the specific issues of how chapter 11 is used again and again to basically undermine laws. He talks about how it gives us rights, but we have these rights before courts with our U.S. trading partners. </ParaText><ParaText id="871582">This takes away our rights, so that again we can have a numbered company constituted in Ontario that can suddenly claim it is American to take that outside the courts, to take that outside of a tribunal that is open, transparent and actually allows for briefs and counterclaims to be made, and gives it to three trade negotiators whose word is final.</ParaText><ParaText id="871583">If the hon. member thinks that is democratic, it is probably in keeping with the direction in which the Conservative government is going.

There was talk about NAFTA and chapter 11 with Canada and even the FTA with Chile. Most of our bilateral foreign investment protection agreements, the FIPAs, and this agreement are kind of at parallel purposes but the thing that is similar is what they do in terms of who gets to be heard.</ParaText><ParaText id="871586">The dispute settlement option that can be chosen by investors is in both the state of the investor and the host state of the investor, and their party to this agreement. What is fascinating, however, and that is to discern between these two kind of formats, the chapter 11 method and the method that we are describing today, is the transparency. What we do not get from the government is a clear indication of where the transparency is.</ParaText><ParaText id="871587">If we look at the trade agreements that have been passed and where the deals are done, given that Canadians I think value more than anything transparency and accountability, why does the member think that this particular arrangement is going through so quickly?

In addition Canadian investors doing business in the country with which Canada has a foreign investment promotion and protection agreement will have recourse to ICSID arbitration for violations of that agreement as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="871607">Becoming a party to the ICSID convention will also make Canada a more attractive destination for international investors and that will mean jobs for Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="871608">The most significant advantage of the convention is the enforcement of arbitral awards. Unlike awards issued by other arbitral institutions, domestic courts cannot refuse to enforce decisions issued under the ICSID convention. Rather, such awards are enforceable in any country that has ratified the convention as if they were a final judgments of the courts in that state.</ParaText><ParaText id="871609">The tremendous growth in investment and investment-stated disputes has made Canada's failure to ratify ICSID the focus of attention by Canadian business, the Canadian legal community and our trading partners. As I have indicated, to date 143 states have ratified the ICSID convention. The majority of our major trading partners are parties to it except for Mexico, India and Brazil. Ratifying the ICSID would bring Canadian policy into line with our OECD partners. </ParaText><ParaText id="871610">In a survey conducted by the ICSID centre in 2004, 79% of the respondents said ICSID plays a vital role in their country's legal framework and 61% said ICSID membership has contributed to a positive investment climate. Those are significant numbers.</ParaText><ParaText id="871611">The ICSID regime provides several important advantages, and compared to other arbitration mechanisms, the ICSID regime provides better guarantees regarding enforcement of awards and more limited local court intervention. Any arbitral award rendered under the auspices of ICSID is binding and any resulting pecuniary obligation must be enforced as if the award were a final domestic court judgment. </ParaText><ParaText id="871612">Moreover, all ICSID contracting states, whether or not parties to the dispute, are required by the convention to recognize and to enforce ICSID arbitral awards. Investors often prefer to rely on such arbitrations rather than on local courts of the country whose measures are in dispute to ensure an independent resolution of the dispute. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp><ParaText id="871613">ICSID's relationship to the World Bank assists investors in obtaining compliance with ICSID awards and its roster of arbitrators gives investors access to well-qualified arbitrators at ICSID controlled rates, with extensive experience in international investments arbitration. ICSID also provides important institutional support for litigants.</ParaText><ParaText id="871614">The ICSID convention is a well-known tool for the settlement of investment disputes. Therefore, the interpretation of the convention and its usefulness are predictable.</ParaText><ParaText id="871615">Canada already has numerous links with ICSID. Provisions consenting to ICSID arbitration are commonly found in contracts between governments of other countries and Canadian investors. The NAFTA in chapter 11, the Canada-Chile free trade agreement, and most of our bilateral foreign investment protection agreements, or FIPAs, provide for ICSID as a dispute settlement option that can be chosen by an investor if both the state of the investor and the host state for the investor are parties to the ICSID. </ParaText><ParaText id="871616">Obviously Canada must become a party to the ICSID because Canada and Canadian investors cannot benefit from the choice if Canada is not a member. This is an increasingly important problem. Within Canada the use of ICSID would be consistent with the policy of supporting the use of the alternative dispute resolution mechanisms for investor-state disputes. While ICSID is less expensive and more efficient than current alternatives, it is not expected to lead to increased litigation against the government.</ParaText><ParaText id="871617">Under a government whose recent record is one of stifling international participation by Canadian companies, it is important that we pass a bill that protects the rights of our investors in other jurisdictions. With hugely increased trade with emerging giants, such as China, and other countries with governance structures much different from our own, it is important, in fact it is essential, that Canada be a part of the international convention on the enforcement of investors' rights.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="50">(1750)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Dewar" id="2278617"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78922" Type="2">Mr. Paul Dewar (Ottawa Centre, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="871618">Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to note the member's comments about where the dispute would be settled. The crux of our concern is that this will take away the decision making from what it used to be or exists now, a dispute resolution within the confines of our own borders, and transfer it to the World Bank. Some would say that is fine and I would concur if there was some measure of transparency that we would all agree with. Earlier in his comments with one of his colleagues, he assured us that was the case, that as of April 2006 there is absolute transparency. But that is not the case. I quoted from the blues in committee where it was brought forward in witness evidence that it is not the case that it would have absolute transparency. It is contingent. The problem with this process is that there are so many contingencies. It is contingent when a tribunal is put together. </ParaText><ParaText id="871619">What happens if someone wants to appeal? We learn in this agreement that the appeal process is not something we would expect in Canada in terms of being able to appeal a decision of a court. He intimated in his comments that the decisions are final, that everyone has to abide by the decisions and that is it. </ParaText><ParaText id="871620">When we talk about the transfer of decision making, a lack of accountability, as I have already mentioned, or these contingencies and we underline the fact that there are countries presently that are not signatories to this, the question is what is the benefit for everyday Canadians. What would Canadians really get from this deal? The answer is not a lot, and what they get is a lot of questions. </ParaText><ParaText id="871621">In light of the fact that we are handing over decision making to a third party, in this case the World Bank, in light of the fact that all decisions are not fully transparent and in light of the fact that we are depending on a tribunal in Washington without the ability to make decisions in Canada, how can the member support this bill?</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Maloney" id="2278650"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78608" Type="2">Mr. John Maloney</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="871622">Mr. Speaker, I would point out that this is an option.

I would agree that it would not be the end of Canada as we know it. It would not wreck or destroy our economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="871637">Let me start off with those measured comments, but we need to be very vigilant on what we are actually deciding and what potential pitfalls there are. If we look at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, we will see that it is one of those groups within the World Bank that is not very well known. If we were to ask our constituents about it, or if I went out here on Bank Street and asked people if they were aware of the ICSID, most of them might look at you quizzically.</ParaText><ParaText id="871638">There is a reason for that. It is an investor dispute mechanism that provides multinational corporations with powers to sue governments when they impose domestic laws or regulations that have a significant detrimental effect on corporate profit-making. In other words, what is critical here is to understand why this is in place. Who does it benefit? Then it comes back to us as legislators. What does it do for everyday people?</ParaText><ParaText id="871639">I would submit that this is something that benefits multinational corporations and large investors, but I cannot make the argument that this benefits everyday Canadians. In fact, it has the potential to see us give up our sovereignty. I say that because this arrangement agreement has been around, as has been mentioned already, for more than 40 years, but it seems we now have a rush to sign on to this.</ParaText><ParaText id="871640"> I find that a little strange. It is of concern to me when we see a major sell-off of resources, particularly here in Canada, a major sell-off of our resources, of companies that have been Canadian from the beginning, we might say, and certainly companies that have been around for more than 20 or 30 years, and we note that there is not a problem in terms of foreign investment in Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="871641">The dilemma we have is in making sure that we have some hold on the economic reins, that we in fact get to determine our financial pathway, that we are able to have an economy that is a mixed economy for sure, a pluralistic economy absolutely, but one in which there is a balance.</ParaText><ParaText id="871642">When we take a look at this agreement, we see that what this agreement will do is allow multinational corporations powers to sue governments when they believe they have been wronged. We have already heard some examples from my colleague from Timmins about the perils of that. </ParaText><ParaText id="871643">We know that the World Bank organized the international body in 1966. Historically, capital-exporting countries have used a variety of these kinds of carrots and sticks to protect the economic interests of their major corporations abroad. They use these as a vehicle, as a tool, so to speak. If they cannot get what they want in a forum that is agreed upon between states, they use this forum.</ParaText><ParaText id="871644">While many might say it is fine, that if we look at some of the decisions we can see that they were amicable and there were no problems, we also have to take a look at the potential for this to be a negative situation for Canadians and, for that matter, for Canadian investors.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp><ParaText id="871645">For instance, the United States has a long history of using these kinds of tools to its benefit, so we have to take a look at how the mechanism works. What we find is that in the way the tribunal is set up, we have what I think is really an imbalance in the structure. We know that the way the panellists are chosen and put forward is that they are agreed upon by members of the treaty. That sounds fine until we get to the point of asking this question: what if there is a problem with a decision that has been made by the tribunal?</ParaText><ParaText id="871646">We know there is no satisfactory appeal process, not in my opinion. The decisions are pretty final once they are made, once we have entered into the process. If someone thinks that a decision was not fair or that not all the evidence was brought forward, unless it can be proven there was corruption or unless there is a smoking gun, an appeal is not permitted. </ParaText><ParaText id="871647">In fact, let us look at article 52. To be clear, the appeal process is actually an annulment. It says to get rid of the whole decision. That is really not an appeal in my books. Article 52 lays out the annulment. It kind of reminds me of how the Catholic church dealt with marriages at one time, when a divorce would not be recognized but there would be an annulment, meaning the marriage did not happen.</ParaText><ParaText id="871648">However, the annulment may be permitted only if the following criteria are met. One is that “the Tribunal was not properly constituted”, but one agrees to the tribunal from the get-go so one would have to prove that somehow one did not agree. Another is that “the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers”, but if one agrees to the agreement, one agrees to the powers and the decision-making. That one would be hard to prove.</ParaText><ParaText id="871649">Another is that “there was corruption” on the tribunal. My colleague from Timmins pointed out the problems the World Bank has had in that area. I am not sure that the tribunal would have a very non-jaundiced view of its own operations and it is the tribunal that would determine this. Another is that there was a breach in the rules of procedure. That would be when one filed and what time periods were involved. </ParaText><ParaText id="871650">The final criteria is that the award “has failed to state the reasons on which it is based”. We are talking about agreements that are in the millions and tens of millions of dollars. It would be very unusual to have an award that would not state the reasons on which it was based. Both sides have lawyers, if not teams of lawyers, who certainly would have provided the reasons why they were in the dispute.</ParaText><ParaText id="871651">Therefore, what we have here in article 52 is a train to nowhere. It is not an appeal process. It is an annulment process. It does not allow a window on the decision-making and therefore I think is a flaw. It is very difficult for anyone to be able to challenge things. We know that about four countries now are trying to get out of this agreement, but it is very difficult.</ParaText><ParaText id="871652">I will mention one of the reasons why it is difficult. If I may turn to article 71, in terms of being able to get out of this agreement it sounds good, in that one gives notice and gets out of the agreement. The problem is that we can have companies and corporations that have in fact signed on to these agreements and will tell their respective governments that if they pull out of an agreement it will harm them and there will probably be some legal action from those corporations against their very own governments. Sometimes this can mean corporations that are not centred in their respective countries but have business in those countries. </ParaText><ParaText id="871653">What does that mean? It means that notwithstanding the fact that article 71 allows a nation-state to withdraw from the agreement, it is much more difficult than that. This is not unusual. We know that with some of the trade agreements we have signed on to it is one thing to see there is an escape clause to get out of an agreement that we do not believe is in our best interests, which is easily stated in an agreement, but it is another thing to actually do. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp><ParaText id="871654"> Why? Simply put, when we get into these trade agreements, they become intertwined. Corporations do their business based on those agreements. If they feel they will lose out, it is their right to take their respective governments to court. It is important to note that and to note as well that there are nation-states right now that are trying to withdraw from this treaty and are encountering challenges and difficulties.</ParaText><ParaText id="871655">It is important to note that this is not in isolation. Recently the government built on the work that was done by the previous government on the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, I am not suggesting that this treaty will be the end of our country or that we will be giving up all of our sovereignty, but--and I underline “but”--it is one of the threads that is undoing the fabric that we have to be a sovereign state, to decide how investment is done and certainly how to challenge when unfair investment is taking place.</ParaText><ParaText id="871656">I would say the same with the security and prosperity partnership. It was really interesting when the previous government brought forward the security and prosperity partnership. The Liberals said it was something they had to do to streamline procedures and processes and we should not worry. They said we should just trust them because it was something that would be good for Canadians. </ParaText><ParaText id="871657">Most recently we have seen that partnership extended when the SPP talks were held not far from here with Mexico, the United States and Canada. What is disturbing about that agreement and also this particular treaty is that most Canadians are unaware of what the consequences will be for them.</ParaText><ParaText id="871658">When people talk about the security and prosperity partnership, they always say that it is a very dense kind of document, the little bit that is available, and they ask why it is something they should be concerned about. I simply ask them if they are concerned about what is on their table. Who decides the regulations around pesticide residue? Who decides the degree to which additives are put into our food supply and what kinds? Who decides what kinds of security arrangements we have at our border? If we are concerned about those things, we should be concerned about the security and prosperity partnership.</ParaText><ParaText id="871659">The Liberals said they just wanted to streamline procedures and regulations. This government says the same thing. Why would they be concerned about bringing these changes in procedure to this place, to Parliament, to allow Canadians, through their members of Parliament, to understand what they are?</ParaText><ParaText id="871660">It is a matter of how we think government should work. Is this something that governments should have a role in? Should they decide, in an open forum, how food quality and security arrangement procedures are done? Should that be done in the full light of day or should it be done behind closed doors? If we believe the previous government and this government, they have said that we elected them to do that, that we should just trust them and just not worry about it.</ParaText><ParaText id="871661">When we look at this particular treaty and some of its pitfalls and at the security and prosperity partnership and the lack of transparency there, we come to the conclusion that our governments simply do not want to share this information with Canadians. As I mentioned, in this particular treaty there are problems in article 52. There are also problems in article 71.</ParaText><ParaText id="871662"> We also have to evaluate what it is that Canadians are going to receive from this. When I asked at committee what benefits would accrue to Canadians, even those who were supportive of the treaty said it was something that would actually help business. That is fine. That is good. We want to have a healthy business sector, as I mentioned before, and a mixed economy, one that creates investment opportunities. However, I asked one of the witnesses if this is something we are lacking right now, as a result of which we are not receiving investments, and the answer was clearly no. It is not something we need to have in any way, shape or form to entice people to invest in Canada. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp><ParaText id="871663">People have probably noted, by looking at the business pages of late, two things. One is the manufacturing jobs, which have been the foundation of many of our communities, are falling apart. They are basically bankrupt or are going down the highway. The other thing people will note is that the businesses doing well are the ones that are taking our resources, be it bitumen and the oil sands or natural resources on the west coast, forestry, et cetera, but not having that value added. </ParaText><ParaText id="871664">We are not getting the kind of investment that would help those in our cities, town and villages to build a better life and a better community. Why? I think it is because the government is more focused on standing up for corporations and streamlining things for them. Let us be honest about it, the government is not really concerned about the investments that go to help in the communities, villages, towns and cities across the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="871665">I give the forestry sector as an example. This will not help the forestry sector in any way, shape or form. The $14 billion in tax cuts, the great tax cut swindle this past fall, will not guarantee key investments in the forestry sector or in the auto sector. In fact, we are waiting on the government to give some sense that it is there to help everyday Canadians, but it has said only if we pass its budget.</ParaText><ParaText id="871666">These kinds of treaties, the SPP kind of process, are a clear indication to Canadians of where the present government, the previous government and opposition parties stand on this bill. The government is more concerned about making sure things are nice and streamlined, thanks very much, for multinational corporations. However, when it comes to the person who gets up every morning, goes to work, does his or her best, contributes and builds through the individual's community, the government says sorry that is does not have much for them.</ParaText><ParaText id="871667">Ask people who have been laid off in the forestry and manufacturing industries. There is nothing there for them. All they have been given is a cent off the GST. That is great. I am sure they are very thankful of their government for that.</ParaText><ParaText id="871668">When we look at the cost benefits of the bill and what the government has done for working families and everyday Canadians, one has to say not much. By changing the dynamics and how we settle investment disputes through the international tribunal process on lawsuits by foreign investors against governments over alleged violations and protections, Canadians understand whose side the government is on, and I guess we can now say the Bloc and the Liberals, and who is on the side of Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="871669">I think most Canadians would want their government to say that in the area of investment dispute settlement what should matter is how it benefits citizens. I can guarantee that by passing the bill, we will be telling corporations that they now have a nice, streamlined procedure so if they need to sue someone, it is no problem, not to worry, to be happy. They will be happy. We heard it in committee. </ParaText><ParaText id="871670">What I have not heard from government or opposition members is that old adage of what is in it for us, the “us” meaning Canadians. I can say there is not a lot. What seems to be there for everyday Canadians is essentially taking our accountability mechanisms and outsourcing them, in this case to the World Bank.</ParaText><ParaText id="871671">I will end where I began. This is not the end of our country and giving up all our sovereignty, but it is a very disturbing thread that we have seen from the present government and the previous government. When we add it up with the SPP and some of these trade agreements, what it tells Canadians is that the government is on the side of multinational corporations, that it is there for them. We saw it with the government's budget and we see it with this bill.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="20">(1820)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Bagnell" id="2278688"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78942" Type="2">Hon.

There will only be binding third party briefs if both parties agree and it will be completely separate from any appeal process. </ParaText><ParaText id="871679">Does my hon. colleague not think it is a bit rich that at this time in our history with, for example, Naomi Klein's book <I>The Shock Doctrine</I> and with the incredible disgrace of Paul Wolfowitz, a good friend of the Conservative Party that has already risen to his reputation, we are now being told the World Bank is somehow an august, credible body in terms of international trade and fairness? </ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Dewar" id="2278697"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78922" Type="2">Mr. Paul Dewar</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="871680">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78395" Type="2">Timmins</Affiliation> for his point which needs to be underlined. The question is, whose side is being represented here? </ParaText><ParaText id="871681">One of the things that I did not include in my comments is that the ICSID administrative council meets each year in the fall, which is at the same time as the World Bank gets together and the IMF has its annual meeting. The council is chaired by the president of the World Bank.</ParaText><ParaText id="871682">I watched the sad saga of Mr. Wolfowitz, the person who came in to say that he would clean up the corruption that was rampant in the World Bank. It was strange and bizarre to watch Mr. Wolfowitz trying to in some way explain himself and what he was doing when he hired one his friends and got her a contract. It was shameless.</ParaText><ParaText id="871683">Here we have a matter of being told to trust them. Why should Canadians put their trust in an institution like the World Bank which has had problems in deciding who is in charge? When someone was found to be corrupt, it had a hard time getting rid of him.</ParaText><ParaText id="871684"> I would suggest that Canadians would be better served dealing with things here in our own jurisdiction and, until the World Bank can get its act together, that we do not go that route, that we keep things here as much as we can. We cannot always do it but in this case we are being offered that.</ParaText><ParaText id="871685">I have one final thing to mention which might be interesting to my friends from Alberta. Why is Alberta not signing on to this? Maybe Alberta has received some intelligence from Washington that this is not something it wants to get into because it might hurt the oil industry in some way if it were to submit its sovereignty to Washington. I do not know if that is the case but it would be interesting for my colleagues, if they have a chance, to answer the question of why Alberta is one of the provinces that does not want to sign on to this protocol.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="25">(1825)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Wasylycia-Leis" id="2278700"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78332" Type="2">Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="871686">Mr. Speaker, I appreciated listening to my colleague's comments on Bill <Document DbId="3085453" Type="3">C-9</Document>.

The cumulative effect of these kinds of decisions is what is worrying Canadians and what is worrying other countries.</ParaText><ParaText id="871687">I want to ask the member specifically about the impact of this approach as we see in Bill C-9 on some third world countries, keeping in mind that this whole initiative is around helping developing nations, and specifically with respect to the role of the ICSID in challenging South Africa's affirmative action policies and the role of ICSID in the economies of Nicaragua, Bolivia and Venezuela, making them withdraw from the ICSID. We are talking about something bigger than has been suggested by the Conservatives, the Liberals and the Bloc, all of whom seem to support this approach. We are talking about some worrisome patterns.

The irony is that initially this was to be an arrangement that was to benefit countries in the southern hemisphere. After World War II and Breton Woods, and the setting up of the IMF, the World Bank was supposed to do the same thing. </ParaText><ParaText id="871689">I do not want to leave people with the impression that the New Democratic Party does not support the idea of these institutions. The problem is what happened to these institutions. The problem is they are not working for people.</ParaText><ParaText id="871690"> Fundamentally the difference we have with the other parties is we believe that these institutions, in fact government itself, should be working for people and not the other way around. Instead, what has happened over a period of time is that these institutions have been tailored not to help people, but they have put corporations ahead. It is very interesting in international law when we look at the rights of people versus the rights of corporations. Corporations are trumping people time and time again. The effects are devastating. They are anti-democratic. </ParaText><ParaText id="871691">Instead of saying we believe in these institutions and that we should reform these institutions so that we can have trade deals that are going to help people and be fair, we see people who are involved in the business of lobbying and international lawyers who look out for the best interests of corporations and certainly themselves being able to change how these institutions work.

At that time, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> was telling us that all was going well, that everything was rosy, that all measures in place were perfect and that there was no need for additional measures.</ParaText><ParaText id="871694">As for the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, he came to Rivière-du-Loup during that period. He talked a little about the fact that the situation maybe was not quite as rosy and that perhaps announcements should be made before the budget. In January, he announced that $1 billion was available for economic diversification of the regions. </ParaText><ParaText id="871695">Until now, this could be considered interesting news. However, there is a problem. Two things are unacceptable. First, the amount is definitely not enough. $1 billion in Canada to resolve the entire issue of economic diversification and to deal with the crisis in the manufacturing and forestry industries is just not enough. What made Quebeckers really angry was that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> decided to tie this to the next budget even though he had been told for several months that it was important to make monies available quickly.</ParaText><ParaText id="871696">Then the Conservative government decided to announce that the money will be made available if the next budget is passed, and that an agreement will have to be reached with the province. Yet the crisis has now been going on for months.</ParaText><ParaText id="871697">Why did the government not do what it did in December following the economic statement, when it tabled a bill to cut the GST and follow through on a number of other things in that statement? The opposition cooperated, and everything was passed before Christmas.</ParaText><ParaText id="871698">Why did the Conservative government fail to take such quick action to help communities, businesses and older workers who need help and who have been affected by the crisis in the forestry and manufacturing sectors? Why is the government unwilling to demonstrate the same degree of flexibility and speed of execution in this case? That is unacceptable.</ParaText><ParaText id="871699">The <Affiliation DbId="78493" Type="2">Leader of the Bloc Québécois</Affiliation> suggested bringing the House back earlier in January, but that suggestion was rejected. Now we are back in the House for the first time this year, and the government is still in a position to move forward and announce that it will introduce a bill and debate it to see how much money should be invested in this plan. </ParaText><ParaText id="871700">The Bloc Québécois is pleased that its persistence has finally resulted in an announcement. However, the plan has to be reasonable, logical, sufficient and, most importantly, it has to be implemented quickly. That is my goal in raising the issue once again.</ParaText><ParaText id="871701">The Conservative government should heed the angry protests of the people affected by the crisis in the manufacturing and forestry sectors, reverse its decision, announce that the money will be made available quickly, and introduce a bill in this House so that we can pass it without delay, as we have done in the past for measures that we believed to be essential.</ParaText><ParaText id="871702">It is possible for members of the House to cooperate on issues like this. The Conservative government has no reason to make this promise contingent on the next budget being passed. The current proposal is for $1 billion from the $243 billion budget for all of Canada. Will the government introduce its bill, open the debate on increasing that amount, and ensure that the money will be made available as soon as possible?</ParaText></Content></Intervention><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Answer" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Menzies" id="2278711"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="113996" Type="18">Mr. Ted Menzies (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="871703">Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Montmagny—L'Islet—Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup for the opportunity to outline the extensive support that this government has delivered for the manufacturing and forestry sectors. This government acknowledges that these sectors are important components of our economy and we have advanced both broad based and targeted tangible measures to demonstrate our commitment to help these sectors succeed.</ParaText><ParaText id="871704">Indeed, since 2006 we have provided over $9 billion in support for the manufacturing and forestry sectors. Measures include support for workers and communities, such as the recently announced $1 billion for the community development trust. This important program will help provinces and territories assist one industry towns facing major downturns, communities plagued by chronic high unemployment, or regions hit by layoffs across a range of sectors, including manufacturing and forestry.</ParaText><ParaText id="871705">Reaction to this announcement has been very positive. British Columbia's Liberal forestry minister, Rich Coleman, has called the trust very good news. Manitoba's NDP premier, Gary Doer, also praised the trust, remarking he was “very pleased with the flexibility because it allows us to target in Manitoba some of the industries that are under pressure”.</ParaText><ParaText id="871706">We have also moved to create a more competitive tax system to help manufacturing and forestry businesses be successful and sustain that success.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="871707">Indeed, the tax reductions announced by this government, the majority of them broad based, will result in over $8 billion in tax relief for manufacturers and processors over the period of 2006-07 to 2012-13. This includes tax reductions totalling about $2.5 billion in this and the next five years. The October 2007 economic statement included reducing the general corporate tax rate to 15% by 2012. A budget 2007 measure allows manufacturing firms to write off their investment in machinery and equipment much more quickly. There are permanent faster writeoffs for computers and buildings used in manufacturing to better reflect the useful life of these assets. These are important measures that will go far in ensuring that our manufacturers can thrive in a competitive global marketplace.</ParaText><ParaText id="871708">For instance, referring to this government's action to lower corporate rates to 15%, Jayson Myers, who is president of Canadian Manufacturers &amp; Exporters and chair of the Canadian Manufacturing Coalition, stated the following:</ParaText><ParaText id="871709"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The reduction in the federal corporate tax rate is an extremely important step in sustaining Canada's ability to retain and attract business investment. It keeps us in the game as countries around the globe are lowering their tax rates to do the same. This reduction is important to the long-term competitiveness of the Canadian economy.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
