					<ProceduralText TocType="TPC" id="1">Bill C-464. Second reading</ProceduralText><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mrs. Hassainia" id="7864970"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170636" Type="2">Mrs. Sana Hassainia (Verchères—Les Patriotes, NDP) </Affiliation></PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3168627">moved that Bill <Document DbId="5814213" Type="4">C-464</Document>, An Act to amend the Canada Labour Code and the Employment Insurance Act (parental leave for multiple births or adoptions), be read the second time and referred to a committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168627">She said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House today to explain to my colleagues why it is so important that we pass Bill <Document DbId="5814213" Type="4">C-464</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168628">This legislation will have major implications for Canadian families. It will have a profound impact and affect the day-to-day lives of numerous Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168629">Bill <Document DbId="5814213" Type="4">C-464</Document> proposes changes to the Canadian Labour Code and the Employment Insurance Act that would offer better coverage for parents blessed with multiples.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168630">The birth of a child brings such joy, but it also comes with anxieties and hard work. As wonderful an event as childbirth is, it comes with a set of responsibilities that require a tremendous amount of time and energy from the parents. And those responsibilities increase tenfold when multiples are involved. Taking care of an infant is a tremendous job; taking care of two, three or even four infants is even more demanding. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168631">Unfortunately, the current legislation makes no distinction between these two types of childbirth. Whether one child or multiple children are brought into this world, parents receive the same coverage and support. That is a major flaw that Bill <Document DbId="5814213" Type="4">C-464</Document> addresses to bring justice to parents of multiples and to truly encourage parents to have children.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168632">The current legislation works well enough for those who are expecting or adopting a single child. They receive employment insurance benefits for up to 35 weeks of leave. The amount varies, but it is up to 55% of regular salary, to a maximum of $501 per week. Generally speaking, this helps new parents take care of their child during the first weeks of life, but for those who have twins, for example, it is often insufficient, given that they have twice as many demands.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168633">As anyone who has experienced a multiple birth knows, having twins presents twice as many challenges. Parents have two mouths to feed. They have to buy twice as many clothes and twice as much food. Sometimes they have to renovate their house or even move, not to mention the fact that two children require twice as much time from their parents. These details cannot be ignored. Psychologically and physically, multiple births also demand more of parents. They have to care for, feed and nurture two babies.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168634">I think I speak for all parents in Canada when I say that it is a challenging experience. However, our current legislation does not recognize that. It treats parents who have one baby the same as those who have two or more. But that is definitely not the reality. This only makes sense: two children, twice as many needs.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168635">I can think of a number of good reasons to provide concrete assistance to parents who have multiple births. It is important to note, for instance, that compared to 1991, the number of multiple births in Canada has risen by 50%. At present, over 3% of pregnancies in Canada are multiple pregnancies, and we can only expect the number of multiple births to increase in the years to come.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168636">We have to help these people. These parents need to be able to look after their children properly. We will be providing concrete assistance to Canadian families who truly deserve it. As elected members representing Canadians, it is our duty to support these families and to encourage them to add to their family for the common well-being of our society.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168637">Not only is it the right thing to do, but it simply makes sense because it will help our society in the long term. A society that looks after its children is a healthy society, and families with less debt contribute to Canada's economic development. That is why Bill <Document DbId="5814213" Type="4">C-464</Document> increases the maximum number of weeks of parental benefits to 70 in the case of multiple births or adoptions. It is simple: 70 weeks divided by two gives each parent 35 weeks of benefits to stay at home and take care of their children together.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168638">We would all agree that this is a much more appropriate period of time given the responsibilities associated with the arrival of two or more children at once.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168639">Promoting gender equality is another important reason. We have come a long way in that regard in the past few decades, but we still have work to do. Giving the same rights to all parents, no matter how many children they welcome into their family, is a step in the right direction. I am also thinking of the fathers. We must not forget them. In a potentially difficult situation, they have to be given the same support as mothers. Making it possible for fathers to stay home with their families also helps mothers and the entire family to better cope with this challenge.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168640">Bill <Document DbId="5814213" Type="4">C-464</Document> does exactly that. It allows the father and the mother to take enough time to deal with the challenges of a multiple birth.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168641">I know that I am speaking on behalf of parents who have experienced a multiple birth when I say that Bill <Document DbId="5814213" Type="4">C-464</Document> will be of great assistance to them. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168642">Multiple Births Canada is a Canadian organization that focuses solely on this issue. After studying the main provisions of the bill, the organization provided its unqualified support. The associations of parents of multiples in Montreal, Quebec City and Trois-Rivières also back Bill <Document DbId="5814213" Type="4">C-464</Document>. Need I say that we have strong support from Vancouver to Halifax for this bill?</ParaText><ParaText id="3168643">Naturally, as is the case with any public policy, there is a cost associated with passing Bill<Document DbId="5814213" Type="4"> C-464</Document>. In these uncertain economic times, we absolutely have to ensure that we make good use of taxpayers' money. We all agree with that. That is why I am pleased to inform you that Bill <Document DbId="5814213" Type="4">C-464</Document> is an affordable and very effective initiative. With a modest amount of money and some goodwill, we can improve the quality of life of many Canadians and, at the same time, improve the economic health of Canadian families in these difficult economic times.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168644">It is important to remember that the bill proposes changes to employment insurance. Taxpayers as a group will not have to foot the bill for this; workers will pay for it themselves. I sincerely believe that this is a fair, feasible and cost-effective measure. The public as a whole will not bear the burden of this new policy. It will be placed on those who will benefit from it. This is an honest and low-cost way for us to offer better coverage to parents.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168645">What kind of money are we talking about? Experts have estimated that this change to employment insurance would cost approximately $27 million a year. As my colleagues are aware, Canadian workers already pay into employment insurance. They are entitled to these benefits. We must remember that this is not just an expense; it is an investment in the health of our families and in lowering household debt, and it is a tangible incentive to increase Canada's already too-low birth rate.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168646">Workers who adopt or give birth to two or more children are also entitled to support. They do not deserve inferior treatment simply because they had a multiple birth. They also pay into the employment insurance system every week. It only makes sense to be fair and practical and to offer Canadian families appropriate coverage that is suited to their needs.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168647">I believe that it is our duty as a society to help those who choose to start or expand a family. I know that my hon. colleagues here in this House share this determination to improve the lives of our constituents. The current system works well for most new parents. However, as I have already explained, there is a glaring deficiency when it comes to multiple births, which have been on the rise over the past few years.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168648">That is why Bill <Document DbId="5814213" Type="4">C-464</Document> seeks to help young families who are facing this big responsibility. This bill is thoughtful and efficient and would provide financial assistance to families who are greatly in need of it. The household debt of families with more than one child is often too high. Bill C-464 responds directly to that need.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168649">We are all well aware that the issues that Canadians care about most are the economy and the importance of family. I can assure hon. members that Bill <Document DbId="5814213" Type="4">C-464</Document> very effectively addresses both of these concerns.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168650">It is through helping families—the heart of Canadian society—that we will improve the lives of Canadians. By so doing, we will also help Canadians get out of debt: a family with less debt is a family that can more effectively participate in Canada's economic development.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168651">We are also responding to Canadians' demands by promoting gender equality within families. Such gender equality also benefits all Canadians who just want to thrive within their families.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168652">Another issue that is of concern to Canadians is the dramatic drop in our country's birth rate. No doubt, one reason for this drop is that families are in tight financial situations and cannot afford to have a lot of children. Once again, Bill <Document DbId="5814213" Type="4">C-464</Document> responds to this concern because it encourages Canadian families to have more children and provides security in the case of multiple births. Encouraging families to have children is a very good thing to do in a country with a declining population.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168653">Finally, Bill <Document DbId="5814213" Type="4">C-464</Document> is being introduced in the House today in order to meet the needs of parents that are not taken into consideration by employment insurance, despite the fact that, in the case of multiple births or adoptions, parents need twice as much help. This is a fair, sustainable and pragmatic bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168654">For all of these reasons, I am quite convinced that passing this bill would be very helpful to thousands of Canadians.</ParaText>

This is how we will move forward. Let us take advantage of this historic opportunity and deliver a clear statement that Canada is a country that is concerned about the welfare of families from coast to coast to coast.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168656"> Once this legislation has been passed, we will be able to look back with pride at what we have accomplished. Future generations will be grateful.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Of course, the figures vary from year to year, depending on the number of births.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168660"> Where is the money going to come from for this program? Parents already pay EI premiums. This bill is an attempt to mitigate an injustice in the present system. While all parents pay premiums, the fact is that a parent with a single baby is currently entitled to 35 weeks of benefits. A parent of multiples is also entitled to 35 weeks of benefits. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168661"> A parent who subsequently has a second child is entitled to an additional 35 weeks of benefits, for a total of 72 weeks of benefits, whereas the parent of multiples will have been entitled to only 35 weeks of benefits overall. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168662"> Of course it is up to the government to decide where it wants to invest its money.

Her bill is a completely legitimate initiative. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168669">We know for a fact that multiples have low birth weights and that multiples born prematurely often require a higher level of care than a single baby.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168670">Could the member for <Affiliation DbId="170636" Type="2">Verchères—Les Patriotes</Affiliation> talk to us about the consequences for parents of multiples of having two babies who wake up and eat at different times and who require more postnatal care than single babies?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mrs. Hassainia" id="7864984"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170636" Type="2">Mrs. Sana Hassainia</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3168671">Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for asking that excellent question.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168672"> A multiple pregnancy generally results in some health problems and multiples, for example those born prematurely, may have serious health issues. A woman who gives birth to multiples may also experience serious postpartum health problems.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168673"> Therefore it is very important to allow the mother the time she needs to recover, with the help of the father who stays home to care for one or both babies in order to give her time to catch her breath, slowly get back on her feet and return to work later. Even her employer will benefit, because she will be healthier, both mentally and physically, when she returns to work.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. O'Toole" id="7864987"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="190568" Type="2">Mr. Erin O'Toole (Durham, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3168674">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today to Bill <Document DbId="5814213" Type="4">C-464</Document>. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168675">Any child is a gift. I would like to congratulate the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170750" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> on the birth of his first grandchild. That is certainly a momentous occasion. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168676">Any child is a blessing. I would also like to call out in the House the birth of Aurélie and Clémentine Smith, twins born at Christmas to very good friends of mine, Paul Smith and Gillian Hewitt Smith. Children are blessings that should be recognized in our communities and today in the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168677">First, the bill would amend the Employment Insurance Act to double the maximum number of weeks of parental benefits for new parents who are blessed with multiple children from a single pregnancy or those who adopt more than one child at the same time. Second, the bill would amend the Canada Labour Code to protect the jobs of these parents for 72 weeks in federally regulated workplaces. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168678">Unfortunately, the government cannot support Bill <Document DbId="5814213" Type="4">C-464</Document>. While we understand the good intentions of the hon. member, her bill would be economically challenging and would run contrary to the structure and ideals of our EI system.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168679">This government more than any previous government understands the importance of family. The families of Durham certainly understand that and I understand that as the proud father of Mollie and Jack, our two children. My wife, Rebecca, and I have had to make decisions in relation to child care and who works in our household.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168680">However, the bill that is presently before the House would not be financially responsible at this time and would undermine the insurance-based principle of the EI system. It was estimated by the member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="170636" Type="2">Verchères—Les Patriotes</Affiliation> that the extension of parental benefits proposed through her bill would cost $27 million. However, the government estimates that program costs alone could be closer to $100 million, not mentioning possible administrative costs. Therefore the financial implications on the EI program could be four times the hon. member's estimate.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168681">Apart from the costs of the legislation, which as I said would approach $100 million, the NDP has proposed over $3.8 billion of new EI spending per year. That is $3.8 billion that would need to be contributed by workers and employers through increased premiums to pay for these benefits. In these fragile economic times, when the EI account is still in a deficit situation, this would not be economically or financially prudent.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168682">These premium increases would come from the pockets of hard-working Canadians who would have less money to bring home to support their families. Employers would also have to spend more money on premiums, which in some cases could be the difference between a business thriving, surviving or going bankrupt. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168683">Just this weekend I met with Scott Delong, a small business owner in the Durham area who is already being squeezed by provincial changes to WSIB. He cannot afford yet another burden, such as the one the NDP is proposing. While our government introduced a new rate setting mechanism to ensure stability and predictability for EI premiums, the NDP is proposing measures that would see EI premiums rise over 16% in a single year.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168684">Allow me to speak for a moment to the insurance-based principles of EI.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168685">First and foremost, we have a good system currently in place that supports parents while providing flexibility so that they can decide what works best for their families. Under the Canada Labour Code parents welcoming a new child into their home can legally take 37 weeks off work to care for that child following the birth or adoption. They are also entitled to 35 weeks of parental benefits under the employment insurance program. The EI parental benefit is designed to temporarily replace income lost while caring for a child. It makes it easier for parents to stay home and care for their newborn or newly adopted child. It is also flexible, allowing parents to share the 35 weeks as they see fit.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168686">The legislation is clear. The EI parental benefit is not tied to the number of children born or adopted at any one time. In fact, no jurisdiction in Canada currently provides additional leave under its employment standards legislation for parents of multiple newborns or multiple adopted children. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="20">(1120)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3168687">The EI program is an insurance program. It is not a social welfare program where the financial needs or circumstances of each individual are considered or measured when determining eligibility, entitlement and the rate of weekly benefits. To put it another way, EI special benefits are meant to replace a portion of an individual's income while they are away from work. What is being insured is the loss of wages, not the personal circumstance of the claimant. To support the bill would fundamentally change the approach to EI special benefits, which is not something the government could support. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168688">Let me also briefly touch on a federal court of appeal decision from January 24, 2013, just weeks ago, which deals with the subject matter we are discussing today. A brief summary of the case is that a Canadian couple was fighting for 35 weeks of EI benefits for each parent because they had given birth to twins. The federal court of appeal was clear in its decision that the act allows for 35 weeks of parental leave for each pregnancy, not for each child resulting from a pregnancy or adoption. The court also found that it did not constitute discrimination, nor inequality under the charter. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168689">Canadian families are a key priority for our government. We have proven our commitment by assisting families with dedicated initiatives, such as the Canada child tax benefit, the national child benefit supplement and the universal child care benefit. Over 1.5 million families benefit from the universal child care benefit each year. It is a program that was created by our government to provide parents a choice in how they will manage their families. Also, 3.3 million parents claimed the child tax benefit. The average Canadian family is now saving $3,000 per year in taxes from what they paid before our government was elected. In my recent byelection in Durham hundreds of parents told me how much they appreciate the choice and assistance these family-centred policies provide. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168690">The child tax benefit and the universal child care benefit are in addition to the 15 weeks of maternity leave granted to mothers, as well as the 35 weeks of parental leave currently offered under EI. As the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister </Affiliation>said previously, we believe that families are the building blocks of our society. Our government has reduced taxes and increased benefits so that parents will have flexibility when it comes to how they raise their children. This is because we believe parents are best suited to decide how to raise their children. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168691">In conclusion, the government cannot support a bill that would increase the cost to the EI account of up to $100 million per year. We also cannot support a bill that would change the fundamental nature of a national program that has already proven to be flexible and adaptable to the needs of families. Therefore, I ask all members of the House to join me in supporting our current robust EI system by voting against Bill <Document DbId="5814213" Type="4">C-464</Document>.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="25">(1125)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Cuzner" id="7865001"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170638" Type="2">Mr. Rodger Cuzner (Cape Breton—Canso, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3168692">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join in the debate this morning, not just as the critic for human resources and skills development for the Liberal Party but as the father of three boys. There is a fairly significant storm hitting the east coast today and schools have been cancelled in Cape Breton and in many districts. As my wife teaches at the community college, she is home today. Therefore, I will be very cautious not to try to overstate how much impact I had in those early days in rearing the three boys. However, from my perspective, I was a spectator in something that I thought was pretty impressive with all that goes on with raising three pretty high-energy boys who were sort born in steps and stairs.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168693">Young mothers almost need a third arm, with all the bags, strollers and kids. We can only imagine the impact when they are trying to do this for twins. When there is a situation with multiple births, we can only appreciate the additional effort and work that has to go into that situation. It is certainly not a normal situation. It is not an abnormal situation, but it is certainly one that I think deserves this opportunity to look at the bill that was brought forward by my colleague.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168694">There are a number of points that I want to raise in my 10 minutes. The challenge is to find that balance between the special circumstances that arise in cases of multiple births and balancing good, fair, reasonable social policy against the cost to the people who fund the program. That is where we have to come up with something pragmatic that also makes sense.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168695">Millions of employers and employees pay into the employment insurance fund. It is our responsibility, as legislators, to ensure that changes in legislation and regulation are looked at and vetted here. Unlike what we have seen with the changes to the current EI system, when we look at working while on claim and some of the other changes that have had a significant impact on seasonal industries, I believe it is in Canadians' best interests that these changes be vetted.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168696">However, I have some questions that I think need to be answered before the bill can be properly judged. I do not think we have seen all the information. There have been a couple of points made. I certainly am not confident in the information that I have. I believe the vetting of this issue and the opportunity to hear witnesses on both sides of the issue would serve us well. It would serve the committee well and that would serve the House well, as this goes forward.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168697"> However, I do not think that we can dismiss the intent of the bill, which is to help families deal with unforeseen and challenging circumstances. That is why I want to support the bill going to committee so that we can assess the merits of the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168698">Canada is one of the most generous countries when we talk about maternal and paternal benefits. Being a proud member of the Liberal Party, I think there is much that the Liberal Party has done in contributing to the reputation that we hold in the world. In 1971, the government led by former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau brought forward the first maternity leave, the 15-week maternity leave. Nineteen years later, Prime Minister Chrétien's government increased those parental benefits to 35 weeks and reduced the hours of eligibility from 700 to 600, allowing more parents to spend more time caring for their children without worrying about losing their jobs or where to find income.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="30">(1130)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3168699">It is noteworthy that my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="190568" Type="2">Durham</Affiliation> is speaking on behalf of the Conservative Party. It is worth pointing out that when Mr. Chrétien brought that legislation in to increase the benefits, the Canadian Alliance, in fact, voted against those increases. I was not surprised to hear that he was not ready to get up and champion this particular piece of legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168700">Bill <Document DbId="5814213" Type="4">C-464</Document> is admirable in the sense that it is trying to help parents who face a special situation. I think all of us here in the House can agree that multiple births are a very special situation. The Dionne quintuplets were very special and captured the excitement and imagination of an entire country. Many times, in multiple births, there are problems with the pregnancy and delivery, whether it is twins, triplets or quintuplets. There is physical, emotional and psychological stress placed on the parents and children, not to mention the financial burden that comes with multiple births. I think those challenges are high and worth noting.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168701">According to Multiple Births Canada, 57% of twins and 98% of higher order multiples are born pre-term, with low birth weights and postnatal concerns. These facts cannot be overlooked or lessened. They are part of the basis of why this bill should at least be studied.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168702">However, some of the arguments put forward in support of this bill have flaws as well. For example, the fact that some countries, most notably Europe, have additional benefits for multiple births argues that Canada should. However, in many of these countries, the total benefits provided are less than what Canada's current system already provides.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168703"> Proponents of the bill say that the additional challenges multiple-birth parents face warrant an additional 35 weeks of unpaid leave and EI benefits; if a single birth parent gets 35 weeks, it would automatically mean that parents of twins should get double, or at least should be viewed as getting double. With twins, I am not sure that there is twice as much work, so to take that correlation and apply it here to simply double the 35 weeks I am not sure is something we are able to do or it makes sense to do.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168704">What we should be charged with as elected officials is to try to get something right, to try to get something that works for the parents that is responsible in terms of protecting the employment insurance fund.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168705">According to the PBO, there are approximately 13,000 multiple births per year, and 6,700 parents would be eligible for this extended benefit. The PBO estimates this cost at approximately $80 million per year. That seems fairly high. However, it is approximately the same cost as Bill <Document DbId="5709667" Type="3">C-44</Document>, the government legislation that created the new special parental benefits last fall. This is another reason we should absolutely send this bill to committee to have it looked at.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168706">My time is winding down here, so I am just going to sum up. I am sure there are things we can agree on in this House. Multiple births are very much a special circumstance. Whether we ultimately agree that parents of twins, triplets or other multiples should get twice the benefits as parents of single births is not the most relevant question with respect to whether this bill should go forward. This bill is at second reading, so it is about trying to gather more information.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3168707">For this circumstance, I believe we should support the bill. Whether doubling is the right way to go, I do not know, but I think we should recognize the challenges faced by the parents of families with multiple births and at least support this legislation as it goes forward to committee.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

This is an important debate, one that must reflect the reality of modern families when it comes to balancing labour market demands and the needs of families.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168709">In Canada, multiple births are on the rise. Over 100,000 children under 13 were born in a multiple birth. Of those children, 41,000 are under five years old. Between 1974 and 1990, the number of twin births rose by 35% and the number of triplets and quadruplets jumped by 250%.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168710">Multiple birth babies represent 2% of births in Canada, but they account for 16% of all low birth weight babies. Just under 50% of twins are born prematurely or are underweight, and that percentage rises to 90% in the case of triplets, quadruplets and quintuplets. These babies need more attention and care.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168711">Low birth weight and premature babies need more assistance than full-term babies, especially if they are very small or born at less than 35 weeks gestation. Premature babies need help surviving outside of their mother's womb. They might have special needs because certain parts of their bodies may not have had the time to develop fully. Preemies can have difficulty breathing because their lungs are not fully developed. They often have difficulty breathing, feeding and maintaining their body temperature. In hospital, they will often be placed in an incubator in order to keep their body temperature up.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168712">Premature births represent a serious public health concern because they are the leading cause of infant mortality in many countries. Premature births are very costly, both for our health care system and for the families involved. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168713">As the member for <Affiliation DbId="170636" Type="2">Verchères—Les Patriotes</Affiliation> said, these families face enormous and constant challenges. Babies born in a multiple birth are often premature and experience developmental problems and lasting effects. These families are often under increased physical and financial stress. The NDP wants to give them a break and support them from the beginning.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168714">In North America, the rate of premature births has increased over the past few decades. Many factors, including delayed child-bearing and the use of assisted human reproductive technologies, have contributed to the rise in multiple and premature births. The growth in the number of obstetrical interventions, namely those related to premature births for medical reasons, is the main reason for this increase. In Canada, the rate of premature births has steadily increased from about 6% in the early 1980s to 8% in the past few years.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168715">Mothers living in low-income neighbourhoods can experience many social and economic disadvantages. In poor neighbourhoods, there is a higher rate of unemployment, a lower level of education, and a high rate of tobacco, alcohol and drug use. Clearly, these mothers will need more support.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168716">Normally, under Canadian legislation, parents can take a total of 35 weeks of parental leave following the birth or adoption of a child while receiving the benefits set out in Canada's Employment Insurance Act. These measures apply regardless of the number of children that are born or adopted at the same time. That is already within the purview of Canada's employment insurance program.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168717">The Canada Labour Code allows natural and adoptive parents to take parental leave of up to 37 weeks under the same conditions as maternity leave, that is that employees, including managers and professionals, are entitled to 17 weeks of maternity leave if they have completed at least six consecutive months of continuous employment with the same employer before their leave begins.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168718">The employee can take this leave any time during the period that begins 11 weeks before the expected date of delivery and ends 17 weeks after the actual delivery date. Female employees who have given birth can take both maternity and parental leave, but only one period of time for each type of leave. Employees who want to take parental leave must do so in one block of continuous time that is not interspersed with periods of work. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="40">(1140)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3168719"> Furthermore, an employee, a mother or father, who takes care of a newborn or newly adopted child is entitled to parental leave of up to 37 weeks, as was said earlier. However, the total length of maternity leave or parental leave must not exceed 52 weeks.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168720"> What the member for <Affiliation DbId="170636" Type="2">Verchères—Les Patriotes</Affiliation> is seeking in this bill is not something that is new elsewhere in the world. For example, in Luxembourg, parental leave is an individual right for both parents, if they both work. Each parent who meets the qualifying conditions is entitled, on his or her request, to six months of full-time parental leave per child. In cases of multiple births or adoption, the length of leave is multiplied by the number of children from the same birth or adoption. If there are four children, it is multiplied by four.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168721"> A Norwegian father will soon be able to take 14 weeks’ leave to care for his newborn child and receive 100% of his salary. A member party of the government coalition announced on Friday, October 5, 2012, that the government would extend parental leave by two weeks to 49 weeks with full pay and to 59 weeks at 80% of salary. We are nowhere near that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168722"> In Norway, parental leave includes maternity leave and paternity leave. Of those 49 weeks, the father's small share, which is not transferable to the mother, will be increased from 12 to 14 weeks. That measure, which will come into force on July 1, 2013, was officially announced in the finance bill introduced on October 8, 2012. The purpose of this provision is to involve men to a greater degree in child-rearing, but also to reduce professional gender inequalities, since mothers are often penalized for being absent from their jobs for extended periods of time. This will make the Norwegian system one of the most generous in the world.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168723"> The current state of affairs is a problem. Canada is no longer a leader in child welfare. It ranks in the bottom third of OECD countries for child mortality, health, safety and poverty. Canada may have been a leader in 1971, but it will have to catch up in 2013.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168724"> The social determinants of health are increasingly being recognized and studied. Several organizations that focus on health are examining them. One of those organizations, and not the least of them, is the World Health Organization. The WHO defines the social determinants of health as the circumstances in which individuals are born, grow up, live, work and age, as well as the systems put in place to deal with illness.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168725"> We know that parents who give birth to twins and triplets find it much harder to manage. Parental leave makes it possible for the parents of young children to interrupt or limit their professional careers so that they can be with their children at important points in the child's development and have the assurance that they can return to their jobs when their leave expires.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168726"> In closing, in view of the sharp increase in the number of multiple births in Quebec and Canada, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170636" Type="2">Verchères—Les Patriotes</Affiliation> has introduced a private member's bill to provide financial support for families in the case of multiple births or adoptions. The member is making children our main priority. The NDP supports her. The public and, especially, parents who have experienced multiple births support her as well. I thank her.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I became a pediatric orthopedic surgeon in part because of my love for children, so I understand that the hon. member has only the most compassionate motives in proposing this legislation. However, accepting the bill as it stands would run contrary to the intent of the Employment Insurance Act, as I will explain.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168728">On multiple births, the EI legislation is very clear. It stipulates that regardless of the number of children born or adopted, the maximum number of weeks of EI parental benefits that can be paid as a result of a single pregnancy or adoption is 35 weeks. The legislation allows one parent to receive the benefit, or both parents to share the benefit at the same time or consecutively. The Federal Court of Appeal recently ruled on this issue and the decision of the court affirmed the legislation as it stands and rejected the charter argument on unequal treatment.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168729">The bill seeks to increase the maximum number of weeks during which parental benefits can be paid from 35 weeks to 70 weeks in the case of multiple births or adoptions. Unlike a social welfare program where the financial needs or circumstances of each person are considered in determining eligibility, EI is an insurance program. It is the loss of wages that is being insured against. EI benefits replace a portion of those wages of a person's losses for their time away from work. Allowing this change would undermine the insurance nature of the EI program and change its purpose. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168730">In addition to the 35 weeks of parental benefits, a new mother also qualifies for an additional 15 weeks of maternal benefits. The principle of maternity benefits is that a new mother should be protected from an earnings loss while she is physically unable to work or seek work in the weeks surrounding the birth of a child or children. The EI program ensures that working families who experience loss of income receive support to balance the demands of both work and family by providing the flexibility they need to stay home and care for their children, their newborn or adopted child. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168731">Our government has delivered several initiatives recently to provide greater financial stability to parents facing difficult circumstances, through the Helping Families in Need Act. We amended the Employment Insurance Act to facilitate access to EI sickness benefits for claimants who had fallen ill or injured while collecting parental benefits. Also, a new EI benefit for parents with critically ill children will help ensure that families do not suffer undue financial hardship due to their child's illness.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168732">As a pediatric orthopedic surgeon, I have seen the immense pressure a family faces when they have a sick child. I can say from personal experience, having seen parents present at the bedside of their child, that it is crucial that they be there when their child needs them. As parents in my riding of Simcoe—Grey have said, they are very pleased that the government has made this substantial investment in supporting families in their greatest time of need.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168733">As well, there is a new grant now available to parents of murdered and missing children. These parents face tremendous emotional stress and often have to take time off work to cope with this tragedy or to be part of the criminal justice process.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168734">We recognize our responsibility to help parents balance work and family responsibilities. We have repeatedly shown our commitment to support families and will continue to do so. Through Canada's economic action plan we have strengthened the universal child care benefit to help more than 2 million young children and 1.5 million families every year. Since it was introduced, this benefit has lifted approximately 22,000 families out of poverty.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168735"> We are helping working parents by making major investments in creating new child care spaces. Our government has allocated billions of dollars to support early childhood development and child care through transfers to the provinces and territories, direct spending and tax measures for Canadian families. To assist low and middle-income families, we have provided additional support through the Canada child tax benefit and the national child benefit supplement. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168736">In addition, through foster-to-adopt programs, foster parents are eligible for EI parental benefits as soon as they have taken the necessary steps to adopt a child into their care. Moreover, self-employed persons are now able to opt into the EI program to receive maternity benefits as well as parental sickness and compassionate care benefits. In addition to this, Canadian Forces members who are ordered to return to duty while on parental leave or whose parental leave is deferred as a result of a military requirement also have an extended eligibility window for EI parental benefits.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168737">Regarding the suggested change to EI, we have estimated that the cost to workers and employers would be approximately $100 million per year if implemented. This is in addition to the $4 billion a year in EI measures the NDP would like to create, including a 360-hour work year, that would drive up EI premiums by 16%. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3168738">I was fortunate enough to be involved in the EI rate-setting consultations that occurred in the fall of 2001. I heard from businesses and workers all across the country about the importance of stable and predictable EI premium rate-setting. While our government introduced a new rate-setting mechanism to ensure stability and predictability for EI premiums, the NDP is proposing measures that would see EI premiums rise by over 16% in a single year.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168739">Nothing is more important than the role a mother or father plays in caring for their child. The family is the fundamental unit of society, the backbone of a successful country. Time and again our government has demonstrated its commitment to helping families. However, in this fragile economic time when small businesses are concerned about EI premiums, supporting a bill that would result in increased EI premiums would be fiscally irresponsible. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168740">While I certainly understand the good intentions of the hon. member opposite in proposing this bill and fully share her desire to provide greater support for Canadian families, as we done most recently with Bill <Document DbId="5709667" Type="3">C-44, the Helping Families in Need Act</Document>, I cannot support this bill at this time because of the huge negative impact increasing premiums would have on small businesses in my riding of Simcoe—Grey. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168741">I encourage all members of the House to join me in voting against this legislation, which will put a huge burden on the backs of small businesses, employers and employees in this country.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Bill <Document DbId="5814213" Type="4">C-464, An Act to amend the Canada Labour Code and the Employment Insurance Act</Document>, which would grant extended parental leave for multiple births or adoptions, is simply a way of levelling the playing field for parents of multiples.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168746">This bill addresses a simple situation. Parents normally receive 35 weeks of parental leave and benefits per child, but that is not the case when parents have two or more children at once. That discrepancy is based solely on the children's date of birth. Birth or adoptive parents of twins or multiples are at a disadvantage.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168747">This bill is designed to help these families by granting them more parental leave and providing adequate financial support. Parents could take as many as 72 weeks of leave for multiple births or adoptions. These 72 weeks could be shared between the two parents, depending on their needs. Obviously, every family's situation is different. We want this to remain flexible. The weeks could also be fully used by one parent.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168748">Currently, neither the Canada Labour Code nor the Employment Insurance Act provides any flexibility for parents who give birth to or adopt multiple children. This is unfair to parents of twins, triplets, quadruplets and so on, and to parents who adopt more than one child at the same time. On the Service Canada website, the section on employment insurance maternity and parental benefits simply states the following:</ParaText><ParaText id="3168749"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The number of weeks of EI maternity or parental benefits you are entitled to receive does not change, even if you have a multiple birth...or if you adopt more than one child at the same time.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3168750">Having more than one child at a time may seem to be an uncommon occurrence, but it is not at all unusual and is happening more and more frequently. In 1980 in Canada and Quebec, twins occurred once per 54 births. In 2010, twins occurred once per 33 births. The rate has gone up. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168751">Since 1981, the incidence of multiple pregnancy has increased by 50%. Today, 3% of all pregnancies are multiple pregnancies. With twin births alone, 6% of children born today would be affected by this legislation, not to mention pregnancies involving more than two children and adoptions.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168752">This is not a huge number, but it represents many children who will have less access to their parents early in life because they are multiples. We want to give all newborns the same opportunity.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3168753">The rate of twins born in Canada has increased dramatically, according to Statistics Canada and Health Canada, and the rate of multiples even more than that. Each day, more than 26 Canadian moms give birth to multiples. This increased number of multiple births can be seen largely in consequence, but not a direct effect, of the trend toward women delaying childbirth. More and more women look to complete an education, establish a career and gain economic stability before starting a family. Studies show that the older a woman is, the greater her chance of conceiving twins or multiples. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168754">That is why it is important to support the bill and acknowledge that the situation of moms is changing and that more multiples will be born. We need to understand that these children and parents need to be treated fairly within our employment insurance system. We should always be thinking about equal treatment when looking at laws in the House.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3168755">I want to briefly refer to a book written by an expert on the matter, Gisèle Séguin, who is the mother of twins. For many years, she was very active in the twins parents association in her area.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168756">Her book, <I>Jumeaux: mission possible!</I>, was published by the CHU Sainte-Justine Mother and Child University Hospital Center. According to the author, a multiple pregnancy is automatically a risk pregnancy. I believe my colleague mentioned this. A multiple pregnancy can result in premature birth. The children require more care. Being pregnant with more than one child probably changes people's plans, such as returning to work as quickly as anticipated. In any event, a child who is more at risk requires more care from the parents.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168757">Moreover, the financial stress makes life difficult for parents. Raising twins costs twice as much as raising one child or two children born at different times. There are twice as many diapers, high chairs, and car seats to buy. Everything needs to be doubled. When children are not the same age, some things can be reused. But with twins, two bicycles or two sets of hockey equipment are needed at the same time. With a multiple birth, the cost of education doubles or triples. We must bear in mind that raising multiples requires more energy and results in greater financial stress.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168758">I think that my colleague has found a good solution to this problem, one that will help us support families with multiples.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168759">I hope that the Conservatives and all members of the House will acknowledge that this is a question of equal treatment for the children and parents in the case of a multiple birth.

Second reading</ProceduralText><SubjectOfBusinessContent><ParaText id="3168769">The House resumed from February 1 consideration of the motion that Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52, An Act to amend the Canada Transportation Act (administration, air and railway transportation and arbitration)</Document>, be read the second time and referred to a committee.</ParaText><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Kellway" id="7865030"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170669" Type="2">Mr. Matthew Kellway (Beaches—East York, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3168770">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to stand in the House today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> and to kick off today's debate on an act to amend the Canada Transportation Act.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168771">Here is a word about the rail industry in Canada to set some context for this discussion of Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>. First, rail transport is critical to Canada's economy, and 70% of all surface goods in Canada are shipped by rail. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168772">The rail industry has to work for Canada. Under the current government, our trade deficit is ballooning, reaching nearly $2 billion in November alone. There can be no tolerance, because there is no room in our economy for the kinds of inefficiencies, excess costs and performance woes that characterize our rail system presently.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168773">The problem is that rail freight customers are struggling to get fair and reliable services from the virtual monopoly of CP and CN that control Canada's rail system. Many rail freight customers cannot even get a contract for service from one of these companies. Those who do get them have to contract for unreliable services that are costing the Canadian economy hundreds of millions of dollars every year.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168774">Rotting crops, idled plants and mines, missed connections to other forms of transportation, all of this is hurting Canada's exporters, damaging our global competitiveness and costing us jobs.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168775">These issues affect a broad range of economic activity, from agriculture, forestry, mining and the chemical industry to the automotive industry.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168776">This set of circumstances is not new. It has defined the industry for a number of years, frustrating rail freight customers so that 80% of them are now unhappy with their rail service. They have been demanding change: action from the federal government, legislation that would compel CN and CP to provide service agreements to shippers.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168777">Change has been slow in coming, however. The rail freight service review began in 2008. We had the panel, its report, a mediation exercise, another report and then the promise of legislation from the minister.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168778">However, it seems that it was the private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="5620079" Type="4">C-441</Document>, of my colleague, the NDP member for <Affiliation DbId="170633" Type="2">Trinity—Spadina</Affiliation>, that pushed the government at last to release the government bill we have before us.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168779">This is a tepid response to a real economic problem. It does not cover existing contracts. It offers only a narrow, costly arbitration process for failed negotiations for new contracts. Freight customers' demands to include penalties in service agreements, performance standards and accessible conflict resolution were ignored.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168780">It is a start, but much more needs to be done and we will support the bill through to committee for amendments to redress the weaknesses and omissions in the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168781">Before it gets to committee, I think it is useful to think through more carefully and thoroughly what opportunities are lost to our economy, to us, with our rail system structured and regulated as it is presently.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168782">The current issues confronting freight customers stem from the fact that the rail industry in this country is a virtual monopoly. It was made that way in 1995 with the sale of Canadian National Railway, along with the tracks, to private interests.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168783">What was made with the sale was a virtual monopoly of a $10 billion industry that sits at the heart of the Canadian economy. Quoting from a Transport Canada document on rail transport:</ParaText><ParaText id="3168784"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Of total Canadian rail transport industry revenues, CN accounts for over 50% and CPR for approximately 35%. Together, CN and CPR represent more than 95% of Canada's annual rail tonne-kilometres, more than 75% of the industry's tracks, and three-quarters of overall tonnage carried by the rail sector.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3168785">It is important for both our economy and our environment that our rail system run with full efficiency. The alternative to rail freight is on-road transportation by way of trucks.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168786">According to the latest Environment Canada national inventory report, 1990-2010, most transportation emissions in Canada are related to road transport. Emissions from road transport rose by 37 megatonnes, or 38%, between 1990 and 2010. Of those 37 megatonnes, emissions from heavy duty diesel vehicles or large freight trucks rose by 20 megatonnes. That is a 101% increase.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="05">(1205)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3168787">It is worth noting here that the GHG emission intensity of freight rail improved by 24% between 1990 and 2008. It should also be noted that there remains plenty of room for improving the emission intensity for both freight and passenger rail travel. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168788">We know that not all truck freight is replaceable by rail freight and vice versa, but this is a worrying trend. It is worrying not just from an environmental perspective, but it also speaks to the broader issue of congestion on our roads and the environmental and economic costs of that congestion. Clearly, the more freight we can move by rail, the fewer trucks are unnecessarily using our road network for freight transport. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168789">The same obviously holds true for passenger travel. It is notable that while passenger kilometres—that is, passenger travel by motor vehicle in Canada—have been on a long upward trend, passenger kilometres by train have remained virtually steady since plummeting in 1990. Of course, it was in 1990 that VIA Rail lost over 45% of its ridership in the aftermath of the federal government ordering VIA to abandon certain corridors and branch lines. As a result, passenger travel on VIA fell from its peak of about eight million passengers per year in the 1980s to a ridership that has bounced around the four million mark since. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168790">Efforts to increase rail service for passengers have been stifled by the virtual monopoly of CN and CP. VIA operates its trains on 12,500 kilometres of track, but it owns a mere 2% of that. Eighty-three per cent is owned by CN and CP, with CN owning the majority of that track. The remaining track VIA uses is short line infrastructure, which is owned and maintained to reflect the freight market that these tracks serve. Therefore, with virtually no ownership of track and no priority access to track, VIA Rail must negotiate train service agreements with these major freight carriers in order to provide its passenger service, and it finds itself in the unenviable position of sitting between a virtual monopoly and the succession of Liberal and Conservative governments that failed to recognize the enduring value and incredible economic and environmental potential of rail travel to the country. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168791">This indifference of our government to the economic and environmental potential of rail extends well beyond freight-related issues and intercity passenger travel, right into our cities. This is certainly the case in my city of Toronto. Investment in transit infrastructure, particularly in the form of rail transit, is critical to unleashing the economic potential of Toronto's city region. Infrastructure, and transit infrastructure in particular, is a key component of a competitive business environment. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168792">This is most certainly the view of members of the Toronto Board of Trade. They identified transit infrastructure as their top priority. The Board of Trade's 2011 annual global benchmarking study shows why it requires urgent attention and investment. Toronto finished 19th out of 24 global cities on transportation issues, including last place in commute time and, significantly, 16th for kilometres travelled by rail. There is near consensus that the absence of adequate transit infrastructure in Toronto and the Toronto city region is the biggest impediment to Toronto's global competitiveness. It has been estimated that the annual cost of congestion to Toronto's regional economy is $6 billion. That cost is projected to rise to $15 billion if no significant action is taken. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168793">It is time to take significant action. The cost of the status quo is too great and unnecessary. It is one of the great mysteries of the current government. It continues to contradict its own marketing materials and brochures every day. It is emphatically not a sound economic manager. It stands idly while opportunities for economic growth pass it by. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168794">Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> is just the latest example of any easy fix but also of a government that responds only when pushed, and only then half-heartedly, to opportunities to improve the economy of the country and the lives of Canadians. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

My speech is about lamenting lost opportunities and the sale of Canadian National under the Liberal government in 1995. It undermined great opportunities that we had to increase the competitiveness and efficiency of our rail services in this country both in terms of freight rail and passenger rail. We are stuck in these circumstances with passenger rail in particular, with VIA Rail not being able to establish priority schedules for passenger travel in this country.

The member pointed out quite rightly that VIA Rail does not own its own tracks. It must get permission and lease them from freight. The increasing problem is that freight trains are getting increasingly longer, which means they can no longer use the sidings that are available. That means that passenger rail always has to go to a siding, because of shorter trains, and wait there while freight goes by. That is undermining the efficiency of passenger rail through freight.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168800">I wonder if my colleague would have any comments.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Chow" id="7865063"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170633" Type="2">Ms. Olivia Chow (Trinity—Spadina, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3168808">Mr. Speaker, every day Canadian shippers suffer from the consequences of getting unreliable freight services.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168809"> Farmers cannot get their grain, soybeans and canola delivered to the port on time, resulting in missed ships, upset overseas customers and rotting crops. Lumber and paper companies in more than 500 forestry dependent communities cannot get their products shipped or supplies delivered because of patchy rail freight services, affecting the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of Canadians. Mining operations, the largest employer for aboriginal people, have to idle productions because they cannot get their coal and other minerals picked up on time.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168810"> The effects are real: hundreds of millions of dollars in lost productivity; and countless lost jobs and lower competitiveness for Canadian businesses in the global marketplace. Canada's farming, natural resources and manufacturing companies are innovative and hard-working, but they lose out against global competitors when they cannot connect with their export partners and disrupted supply chains.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168811">Why is this? Why are our farmers frustrated about delayed pickups of their crops? Why are mining companies frustrated about promised rail cars that are never delivered? Why are paper factories frustrated about damaged rail cars on which they cannot put their products? It is because we have a classic case of market power abuse. The small lentil farmer in Manitoba simply cannot get reliable and affordable freight services from a rail company like CN, even though CN made an annual profit last year of $2.7 billion. Those lucky enough to get a contract with CN and CP have to put up with service disruptions, while many smaller companies cannot even get a contract in the first place.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168812">Eight out of ten rail customers are unhappy with the freight services they get from the big rail companies. Around 80% of rail commitments between the rail companies and farmers and grain elevators are not fulfilled. The future picture is even more dramatic. Forty-five per cent of shippers say that their rail freight services have become worse over the past three years.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168813">Why is the situation so bad? Healthy competition in a marketplace brings prices down and creates a balance between supply and demand. However, that is not the case with rail freight services. Rail freight customers are faced with the entrenched dual monopoly. Together CN and CP dominate with a market share of close to 95%. CN alone accounts for 57% of the market based on revenues and CP accounts for 38%. The remaining 5% is 49 short-line operators that haul freight to the 2 main lines.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168814">Around 80% of rural shippers are captive, meaning they have no choice but to go with the one big rail company that operates in their area, a textbook case of a monopoly. They have no choice but to pay higher prices, no choice but to suffer the consequence of unreliable services and no choice but to endure scheduling changes without advance notice.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168815">Canadians have no choice but to get a black eye on the international stage for unreliable export delivery. It is a marketplace that is broken, where legitimate demand is not countered by adequate supply of services. In the words of the Canadian Industrial Transportation Association:</ParaText><ParaText id="3168816"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Railway Freight is not a normally functioning competitive market....This is the fundamental issue underlying all the price and service problems encountered by rail shippers....It is dominated by the sellers.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3168817">By that, it meant CN and CP.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168818"> What about other modes of transportation? Why can rail freight customers not ditch the rail companies and go with delivery by truck or ship?</ParaText><ParaText id="3168819">The Canadian Industrial Transportation Association said:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168820"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">—the reality of moving to other modes in most cases is not practical in any reasonable scenario. Truck equipment may not be available in the short to medium term and volumes may be too great to transfer to truck....Over the past seven decades, the railways have lost significant market share to trucking and it is likely that most traffic that could take advantage of the trucking option, has moved to truck.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3168821">In other words, trucking only works for certain distances, depending upon the value and the volume of the freight. Just to illustrate this point, a train hauling potash carries an average cargo of 10,000 tonnes. That is the equivalent 385 semi-trucks. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168822">Leaving aside considerations like pricing and delivery time, just getting such a fleet of trucks is simply unrealistic, in most case, when the rail company decides not to show up on time.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168823"> It is not just the shippers that are captive. Many of Canada's ports are as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168824"> East of Montreal to the Port of Halifax, CN is the only major railway. A similar situation exists in northern B.C., with CN being the only railway serving the port of Prince Rupert. Likewise, southeastern B.C. and southern Alberta are served only by CP. In parts of northern Ontario, the CN and CP main lines are enough separated that they are monopoly rail carriers in those areas as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168825">Given this situation, any efforts from the industry and the government must focus on improving rail freight services, while making the pricing competitive so rail freight customers are not left completely vulnerable.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168826">One of the core issues is that shippers have no effective way to get the contracts fulfilled, if they are even among the lucky ones who are able to sign an agreement. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168827">In the words of the Western Grain Elevator Association, rail companies continue to deliver unreliable services, “because they can—there are no effective legal or financial consequences”.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168828"> When it comes to consequences for non-performance we, again, have a completely lopsided situation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168829">By contrast, shippers have to pay penalty fees to CN and CP if they do not have the promised volumes ready for shipping or if they fail to load the rail cars on time. However, it does work the other way around. If rail cars do not show up on time or if goods are delivered late, there is no problem for CN and CP. They get away with all the unreliable behaviour, or bad behaviour, without paying a penny, or should I say a nickel today? The shipper has no choice but to suffer the economic consequences caused by the rail companies. Therefore, we have a pretty desperate picture of Canada's rail customers. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168830">What has the government done to protect them?</ParaText><ParaText id="3168831"> For years, it kept itself busy with talking and making promises. In 2007 the government promised an independent investigation of the situation. The much-heralded rail freight service review finally started in 2008. For almost three years, its experts gathered information, talked to shippers and rail companies, commissioned a much revealing survey and came up with eight key recommendations. The final report was tabled in early 2011.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168832">The minister of transport at that time promised legislation. Then what happened? There was an election. After the election, there was more talking. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168833">More than half a year after the final report, the <Affiliation DbId="111560" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food</Affiliation> decided it was not time for action yet, so he started the crop logistics working group.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168834">Of course, the <Affiliation DbId="170392" Type="2">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> did not want to be outdone, so he kicked off a mediation process between shippers and rail companies in late 2011.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168835">However, as predicated, the mediation was ultimately fruitless because there was a complete imbalance of power. CN and CP were unwilling to make meaningful concessions during the several rounds of negotiations. Without yielding any concrete results, the chair, Jim Dinning, released a report in June 2012.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3168836">New Democrats have stood with the shippers along the way. I tabled my own bill, the rail customer protection act, using the recommendations of these various reports. I have repeatedly called on the minister to give rail customers fair, reliable and affordable services they need to be successful and to make Canada's economy stronger.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168837">The shipping community has consistently been asking the federal government to fix major issues. They have been talking about this for at least over 10 years. One would assume, after all those deliberations and investigations, the government would present a rock solid bill that would protect rail customers, would level the playing field and would bring a balance of power to shipping customers. Unfortunately, while Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> is a step forward, it falls short of what should be accomplished. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168838">How? While shippers would have the right to a service agreement in the bill, there is no model, guideline or template to back up that right. Shipping customers want a model service agreement that gives shippers and rail companies flexibility to negotiate, while starting with certain elements already on the table, like performance measurements and consequences for non-performance. They did not get one in the bill.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168839">Instead, the bill has said nothing about what should be in the service agreements. Many shippers are already afraid they have won a hollow victory. They will sit down with a rail company, knowing they have the right to an agreement, but ever component would have to be a concession of CN and CP, which is a very tough place from which to start.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168840">It comes as a disappointment for many shippers that penalties for non-performance are not included in the bill. Rail customers desperately need to include such penalty fees in service agreements to get compensation for service disruption and the resulting damages and productivity losses. The current bill only includes fines of up to $100,000 in the case of arbitration outcome being ignored by either party. That arbitration process is only available to shippers that negotiate a service agreement for the first time. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168841">The other problem is that such a fine would be paid to the federal government, not to the customer. To act as a real deterrent, fines would have to be significantly higher. Keep in mind unreliable rail services are costing customers millions of dollars, while CN made $2.7 billion last year.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168842">Another shortcoming of Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> is the brand new arbitration process is only available for shippers that are negotiating new contracts. Instead of offering quick and reliable help through conflict resolution to all shippers, Bill C-52 offers arbitration to a small group of shippers. The other problem is that the outlined arbitration process could end up being too costly for smaller shippers. To place the burden of proof on the shippers to demonstrate that they need rail customer services, that they are indeed captives, is indeed unfair and one-sided.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168843">Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> applies only to new service agreements, not existing ones. That means many shippers will continue to be stuck with unreliable, unfair and unaffordable services. They will continue to be without any conflict resolution process in the case of violations to existing service agreements.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168844">The bill does not even tackle the elephant in the room, which is pricing. For years shippers have been complaining about uncompetitive freight rates. It is common that shippers pay prices that are three times as high as the rail companies' variable or direct costs for services, just because shipping companies can get away with it. There is no choice for customers.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168845">The government is wasting the opportunity to get rail customers not only fair, reliable, but also affordable and competitively priced freight services to give rail customers real protection from unreliable services, price gouging and a monopoly that costs the farm, logging and mining industries millions of dollars.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3168846">In conclusion, it is clear that federal action is needed to create a level playing field for Canada's rail customers and shippers, many exporters among them. They deserve fair, reliable and affordable rail freight services to compete and survive.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168847">Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> is a step in the right direction, but it falls short of the hopes of many shippers. The bill would not cover all rate freight customers. Many would be left behind. It would not provide a model agreement, and customers would have to start from scratch. The bill would not compensate for bad service. What would be the consequence for unreliable service? There would not be much. The bill would not curb the monopoly power of the rail company giants, and it would not end price gouging. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168848">In committee, I will work hard to improve the bill, in line with key customer demands.

I know in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="170673" Type="2">Newton—North Delta</Affiliation>, one of the most critical issues for the residents there is to have a national transportation strategy to help provide a framework so that we can have good, comprehensive public transit that will help us get rid of the gridlock, for the movement of goods and for people. When people do not have to sit for hours and hours in traffic gridlock, their mental health improves and they are much more productive at work.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168875">Today we are here to talk specifically about the amendments to rail freight provisions. We are talking about rail freight customers. We live in a huge country, which is geographically challenged, or I might say, advantaged. We have a diverse climate. When I left Vancouver last night at 11:20, it was still 6°C. Then when I arrived here to our beautiful, balmy weather in Ottawa, it was minus whatever. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168876">Moving goods for mining companies, farmers and even for people who want to ship cars across the country, we realize that shippers have a huge geography to contend with. It was with that in mind that our forefathers had the foresight to build a national railroad. It is unfortunate that we have not been good caretakers of the national gift that was given to us. We have seen it face quite a few challenges. On the passenger side of rail, my colleagues who have rail service in their areas tell us how wonderful it is, but out where I live in B.C. we have had much of our passenger rail cut and the rest is not running that regularly. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168877">When we talk about freight in Canada we are not talking about moving goods 100 miles or 300 miles, we are talking about moving goods thousands of miles across the country, going through mountainous terrain, our prairies, from coast to coast to coast. As well, there is the incredible challenge of our climate, yet we have to keep our freight moving throughout the year. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168878"> I am an absolute fan of trains, be they freight trains or passenger trains. Having grown up in England I had access to some of the best train service way back before the British privatized their train service.

							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3168879"> I want us to look at some of the key facts surrounding this issue in Canada. We usually talk about quality service. However, here is a fact: 80% of rail freight customers are unhappy with their services. When I think that 80% are unhappy, that means that only 20% are happy. If I were teaching in my classroom today and I was grading a paper that was only 20% okay, it would not receive a very high mark or even a passing mark. As a matter of fact, it would be an abysmally failing mark, and I feel that is exactly what we are doing. We are failing our mining industry, our farmers and other shippers in industries that transport goods using the freight service.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168880">Our services are so unreliable. They cost the Canadian economy hundreds of millions of dollars every year. If there were no other argument, surely my colleagues across the way could accept the fact that when it costs our economy hundreds of millions of dollars a year, it is an issue they need to address immediately. It is not something we should tinker with part of and then just leave alone for a long time.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168881">By the way, I do not give much credit to my colleagues who are sitting in opposition either, the Liberal Party, because it was under them, under their stewardship, that the CN was privatized in 1995. They privatized the track. There is another way, which other countries are looking at where they keep the track and privatize the actual rail service. However, it was that kind of privatization, without checks and balances, without guarantees, without getting contracts in writing into the future, that is jeopardizing the transportation of goods. I want my colleagues to remember that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168882">We always have to look at our history. History is a great teacher. Basically what we are looking at here today is that if 80% of the people are unhappy and the unreliable freight service is costing us hundreds of millions of dollars each year, just think what it is costing the companies that invest. Think of the rotting crops for farmers who cannot get the service they need when they need it to move their goods from, let us say, the Prairies out to the west coast to be shipped away, or to the east coast. The transportation is stopped. Imagine the idled plants, even on our coastline, that are waiting for the railways to arrive, but they are running late and so they have backlogs. Imagine the mines that miss their shipments. These are the day-to-day realities that these industries have shared with us.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168883">This is a missed opportunity by my good colleagues across the way to come forward with a comprehensive piece of legislation. This particular misstep will continue to hurt Canada's exporters, damaging our global competitiveness and costing us decent jobs. The bill takes a baby step in the right direction, but when we are dealing with hundreds of millions of dollars and peoples' livelihoods, baby steps are not always what needs to be taken. This is a missed opportunity for the Conservatives to address the bill in a comprehensive way.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168884">What we find when we read the bill is that the protective measures do not even cover existing contracts between shippers and rail companies. As well, the legislation will only offer a narrow, costly arbitration process for failed negotiations for new contracts. Key demands, such as the shippers' call to include penalties for rail companies and service agreements, performance standards and an easily accessible conflict resolution process were basically ignored in this piece of legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168885">By the way, these are not the key demands of the opposition. These are not key demands that we have dreamed up. Our critic has done an amazing job consulting with the industries that feel the most impact. </ParaText>

As a matter of fact, if anyone has ever travelled through the Rockies by rail, there is a point where one can stand and see the beginning and the end of a train, because of the geography and the way the rail track was built. If anyone ever gets the opportunity, they should go see that. It is truly amazing. Watching that for what seems like forever, it really strikes home just how much Canadians rely on rail to transport our goods.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168888">Pricing for rail freight services is also damaging Canada's shippers. Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> explicitly excludes pricing, despite the fact that many in the shipping community were calling for this very thing. One has to think, what is the driver for the Conservative government? It certainly is not listening to the people who need to move crops, who grow crops or mine minerals, or the people who are using the freight service. The government is not even listening to the shippers.</ParaText>

However, when we look at the real world outside, it is a very different story.

I am not talking about hundreds of dollars or hundreds of millions of dollars. I am talking about $2 billion, a number I do not think many of us could even write down or imagine how many zeroes come after the number two. We would have to go back to our high school days to remember that. We cannot afford to lose even more ground by taking little baby steps. This is the time when the government could have been bold, addressed all the issues and moved us forward in the right direction. We have to be competitive in the global market. Canada's products can only be competitive when we see an improvement in that figure of the 80% of people who are unhappy with the freight service.</ParaText>

I am not going to try to persuade my colleagues across the way about the need for environmental protection. Whether it has been in the omnibus budget bill or other actions around the Kyoto protocol, the government has shown it has absolutely no commitment to regulations that protect our environment. As a matter of fact, it has shown it is not willing to make any movement toward making improvements to protect our environment. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168892">At the same time, I feel it is my moral responsibility to point out to government members that, if it were improved and more people were happy with it and it were running on time, et cetera, at least our railroad service would take many trucks off the road. More people would use the freight service because they were happier with it, and thus it would be good for the environment.</ParaText>

I have done this at another stage in my life, and I can say it is far superior to travelling by car to work and back and sitting behind the wheel getting all tensed up.</ParaText>

As I said previously, the official opposition's critic, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170633" Type="2">Trinity—Spadina</Affiliation>, has done an amazing amount of legwork on this. Actually, she has met with many of the movers and shakers in this area. She, herself, has formulated policies and amendments that she is bringing forward based on what she heard, not on some ideological shift way out there or a need to look as if she is doing something, but based on listening to the customers and those who move their freight. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168897">Key stakeholders in agriculture, mining and the forestry industry associations have been calling for rail freight legislation for years; for example, and I am only going to name a few, Pulse Canada, Grain Growers of Canada, Forest Products Association of Canada and the Mining Association of Canada. They want, and we want, to have strong legislation to protect rail customers. However, once again the government has given in to inaction or a tiny baby step of action, which creates a great deal of dissatisfaction.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168898">Let me just sum up a few things. Rail transportation is the backbone of our economy. More than 70% of the surface goods in Canada are shipped by rail. I would say that we need to make sure even more are shipped by rail, to get the trucks off our roads. Eighty per cent of service commitments for agricultural rail customers are not met by the rail companies due to delays, an insufficient number of rail cars, etcetera. That is quite a shocking figure. Agriculture cannot live up to its commitments 80% of the time because of the fault of the railway services. That is quite an eye-opener in itself.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168899">The rail freight service review found that 80% of shippers are not satisfied, as I said earlier, but within that whole group, we have agriculture, a key backbone of our country. How can we live with a service where 80% of agriculture commitments are reneged on, not due to any fault of their own but due to the railway service?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168900">We stand with the farmers, and we know how little respect my colleagues across the way have had for the farmers, and we stand with the mining and forestry communities to end unacceptable treatment and unreliable freight services from the big rail companies.

In fact, the Liberal Party has been advocating for this legislation, from what I understand, since 2008, and for very good reason. We need to understand and appreciate just how significant our rail lines are to our nation. We do a phenomenal amount of transportation through those rail lines, from coast to coast to coast. Every community across Canada needs to have a strong, viable rail line or access to such a rail line in order to succeed.

When we drive over that Arlington bridge, we can look on either side and see huge compounds where trains are loaded, offloaded, and their contents transferred to go in different directions, and so forth. We can drive down Inkster Boulevard or Sturgeon Road in the north end, or take a multitude of different bridges that go over the trains, in any single day and see the number of trains, the hundreds of rail cars full of a wide variety of commodities.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168920">Given the importance of our trains in that rail infrastructure, one would think that would be a higher priority for the Government of Canada to recognize—and when I say “to recognize”, that means to get the job done.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168921">The issue that we are debating today is nothing new. As I indicated in a question previously, the shipping industry as a whole, the stakeholders in that shipping industry, have been calling for very specific action virtually since 2007, because of the sense of frustration they have felt over the years. That frustration is based on the sense of fairness. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168922">To what degree is there fairness in the relationship between our rail lines and our rail operators, in particular, CN and CP, which handle about 95% of the traffic? There is a sense of frustration that there is no level playing field, that those two dominant rail lines have too much power and control over freight costs and the type of delivery provided.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168923">I must applaud my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170466" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation>. The member from Regina, Saskatchewan has been a long-time advocate for this change. I know first-hand because I have heard him on numerous occasions in the last couple of years speak of how badly we need to have the legislation that is before us today. I know he has worked with many of the different stakeholders to try to get a better understanding of why these shippers are in the position they are in, and why it is so critically important that we do more. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168924">He has taken the time, not just in recent weeks or months but for years, to try to raise the profile of this issue with the government. I know that he has already had the opportunity to speak when it was first discussed at second reading. I think he has done a fantastic job in ensuring that the Liberal Party is well-positioned to understand this issue and, ultimately, to take it forward.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3168925">I believe that the member for <Affiliation DbId="170466" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation> brings a great deal of credibility as to why this is such an important issue, because he was a former minister of finance. As such, he understands the economics and contribution of our rail lines and how important they are to our overall economy and GDP. He brings an immense amount of credibility to the debate on this issue and has allowed the Liberal Party to be well positioned on it. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168926">We are suggesting that the time has come for the bill to get out of the House and into committee. There are many stakeholders out there who have vested interests, some in the millions and tens of millions of dollars, who want to participate in this debate.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168927"> Many people may not realize that one of the largest stakeholders in the rail lines is Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, who has billions of dollars invested in CN. However, as much as I might like his product, I am very much concerned for the other end, the people who have the $500,000 farm investment or their life's earnings through generations of families and who want to get their product to market. They are the ones I am really interested in hearing from. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168928">That is not say that CN, CP and the short lines should be denied profits. Only the New Democrats would attempt to do that. We recognize that profits are necessary in a capitalistic market to succeed. However, we also recognize that there is a responsibility to be fair, but we have failed in that. The people who have suffered the most as a direct result are the prairie farmers, the shop floor of a manufacturing business in Ontario, the mining that takes place all across Canada and family businesses. They rely on the rail lines to get their products to market and do not have much of a choice in terms of selection.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168929">Whether wheat, barley or potash, there is a litany of things that a farmer or small corporation uses trains for to get their products to market. This is what they have to go up against. One report canvassing the farming community indicated that it could only rely some 50% of the time on rail cars being in the right place at the right time, even though they had placed their order already. How can one manage a farm operation in the face of this? I think that most if not all members of the House would recognize that is just not right and that there needs to be a consequence.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168930">When we look at Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>, we see a bill that is at least moving us somewhat forward. We are not necessarily happy with all of the details of the bill, but I suspect that there will be a number of amendments proposed once we get to committee, and we look forward to hearing these. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3168931">However, the real challenge for the government is to recognize that it has denied the industry the opportunity to provide that direct public feedback. It has held off on this legislation, not once or twice, but on several occasions. Not only did the Conservatives do one study, they did two studies. They have only been in government for six or seven years, yet they have had two studies on the issue. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168932">We know for sure is that there is a high level of interest. From discussions and my understanding from the member for <Affiliation DbId="170466" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation>, we want to afford individuals who would like to come to the committee the opportunity to state their case, to make representations on what they feel is important. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168933">What do I mean by saying that? We anticipate that this legislation will pass. The Liberal Party has indicated that it will co-operate on its passage to committee, because we believe it has taken far too long to get the bill before us today.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168934">What we want in return is not something specific to the Liberal Party as much as it is specific to the different stakeholders out there. We would like to see the committee afford an opportunity those who want to come to committee to make presentations and express their concerns. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168935">I believe that the government needs to hear what shippers and even the rail companies, CN and CP, have to say about the legislation. Given that the legislation has been on the back burner for so long, we recognize that there have been some mild, and I underline the word “mild”, modifications or changes that have afforded some marginal benefits. At least that is what some of the stakeholders have informed us, but nowhere near to the degree necessary.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168936">I think it is very important that through the committee stage we do not try to put limits on how the members might get engaged in this. Sometimes there is even value in taking the committee off the Hill. There could be potential value in that in this situation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168937">At the end of the day, one of the things we are looking for is a very strong service level agreement, so that the industry stakeholders as a whole feel confident that there is something they can do to ensure that their product will get to market in a more timely fashion. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168938">It saddens most Canadians when they hear of the waste that occurs because of delays or the lack of availability of cars. Those are very real issues that many producers have to face every year.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168939"> In the service level agreements, the producers are looking for a commitment in writing to some sort of penalty if the rail line does not live up to its commitment. I refer again to those small producers in particular, but also to all of the different stakeholders who depend so heavily on our rail lines, having their crops at certain stations at the right time in anticipation of their crop ultimately getting to market.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3168940">The same principle applies for other things. I am very proud to be a prairie member of Parliament. There is nothing like driving between Winnipeg and Carman and seeing eight or nine huge combines going through one field. One can see the tonnage of wheat being collected. Ultimately, it will end up on a train. The farmers need to feel confident that the train car will be there at the right time for them. Agriculture uses our railway significantly.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168941">Our forestry industry is huge, whether in British Columbia, Manitoba or Atlantic Canada. There are minerals, again from coast to coast to coast, and chemicals of all sorts, as well as fertilizers. What about the oil and gas industry? Imagine how incredibly important the oil and gas industry is to our country. I disagree with the leader of the New Democratic Party. It is not Dutch elm disease. All of Canada benefits from our oil and gas production out west. I believe that the vast majority, 95%, of Canadians, would recognize the true value of it. Our rail lines play a very critical role in that area also. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168942">The dependence on industrial and manufactured goods is very real. How many trains do we see coming across our country, from Ontario or Quebec, full of brand new vehicles destined for car dealerships? Many of them are pre-ordered. An anxious consumer is anticipating the arrival of his or her vehicle. </ParaText><ParaText id="3168943">The list goes on. To get a good sense of how dependent we are on our rail lines, go to a major rail line, park outside for a day, and see the amount of train traffic that travels by. Watch the containers go by. Whether they are Canadian Tire train traffic, or Costco products, products from China, brand new automobiles, containers of Saskatchewan prairie wheat, Manitoba's and Alberta's endless commodities, or lumber from British Columbia, it is virtually endless. To really get an appreciation of how important rail service is to our nation, park outside a main line and watch the hundreds and hundreds of cars that pass every day and imagine the potential. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168944">If one believes in the Canadian economy, as I do and the Liberal Party does, and that the potential is unlimited, one has to recognize that our rail line is going to play an absolutely critical role in the future development of our country. That is the reason I would ultimately argue that the government has been negligent. This has been an issue on the agenda since 2007.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168945">We are glad to see it here today. We support the bill in principle. We want to see it go to committee. We want to have individuals make presentations and express their concerns. The idea is that the government will be receptive to the necessary amendments that would make the legislation better so that when it comes back at third reading, it will receive the unanimous support of all members of the House, given the very important role of our rail lines, which stakeholders and consumers depend on. </ParaText>

If it is a decent-size step, it would imply that the government is actually going to listen to some of the presenters at the committee stage.

That has to happen in an efficient manner that does not take away from the quality of the product being transported, which has been an issue raised by many individuals. They want their quality product to arrive in the same condition in which it went into the train. Who can blame them for that? After all, they want to have repeat clientele.

It has been my sense that the sector has been in decline for decades.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168974">When a bill is introduced in the House, it is usually because there is some problem that needs addressing. Laws are not passed just for the sake of passing them. We do not set out to bore people. We are not in the business of hurting market sectors. We are here to make things better.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168975">The Liberals acted hastily when they privatized CN in 1995, and they failed to think through the consequences. Monopolies were created in some regions of the country and duopolies in others, and we know what this led to.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168976">In my riding, for instance, one of the consequences of the privatization has become a recurring election issue: the upkeep of the Quebec Bridge and its rail lines. The matter has been before the courts for seven years and is the direct result of privatization. The Conservatives only ignored the problem. When CN was privatized there was no consideration given to the consequences for the users of the different services. It is not worth mentioning VIA Rail because we all know what the problems with it are. We will have other opportunities to discuss this. The users of these transportation services have had problems for years.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168977">The government has finally decided to act, but it is doing the bare minimum, and more needs to be done. We intend to support the bill at second reading and propose amendments to improve it.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168978">If the Conservative government ends up introducing regulations, one can be sure that it is because the problem has dragged on for some while and something really must be done.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168979">Is the fact that it is a private company the cause of the problem? No, the problem is that there is a monopoly. In this situation, there are two conflicting priorities: a company's need to make a profit and provide a dividend to its shareholders, and the service that it must provide its customers.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168980">If there is no incentive created by competition, customer service suffers for the sake of shareholders' dividends. Moreover, an increasing number of sections of railway are being closed in rural regions, more and more services are being dropped and more and more cuts are being made to passenger service. This era has seen the decline of rail transportation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3168981">And that is despite the fact that ours is a huge but sparsely populated country with vast distances to cover. That is why we need an efficient long-distance transportation system that causes as little environmental damage as possible. Rail transportation would fit the bill, but the government is letting the system go downhill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168982">The government waited years to act. It should come as no surprise that people using the service began to get together. I am not suggesting that they began to unionize, because that would freak some people out. People who use the system felt the need to talk to one another about how the level of service does not make sense. They started to exert pressure on the government because the level and quality of service were poor.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3168983">Globalization means that we have to deliver products all over the place, and quickly. Obviously, if someone has a product, be it from a forest, a mine, a farm or anywhere else outside a major centre, that product has to be packed up and shipped quickly. Global competition means that we need to provide this kind of service and we need the infrastructure to do it.</ParaText><ParaText id="3168984">So the question is, how can we balance the need for a business to make a profit—be it a farm or a major corporation in a remote location—with the needs of many companies that often have no alternative form of transportation? Throw into the mix the need for transportation to be as green as possible. How can we bring these needs in line with each other?

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Cuzner" id="7865514"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170638" Type="2">Mr. Rodger Cuzner (Cape Breton—Canso, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3169310">Mr. Speaker, I rise pursuant to Standing Order 52 to request an emergency debate today on the urgent matter relating to the disclosure by Human Resources and Skills Development Canada on January 11 that the department had lost the personal records of 583,000 Canadians who participated in the Canada student loans program between 2000 and 2006. According to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, this is one of the largest data breaches in Canadian history.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169311">The House of Commons needs to debate this issue because the loss of this data means that the private and confidential financial information of almost 600,000 Canadians is at risk and there exists a real danger of identity fraud.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169312">Furthermore, the <Affiliation DbId="128694" Type="4">Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development</Affiliation> has been unable to tell the House of Commons how long the hard drive containing the data was missing from her department, exactly what information was lost, why social insurance numbers were included in this data, why the RCMP was involved and why it took two months to inform the public.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169313">In addition, the House needs to debate the issue of protection that HRSDC is providing to these Canadians. There has been much confusion as to what credit and identity protection services the government is actually paying for with Equifax, one of the two major credit bureaus in Canada. As well, why is the government not paying for the equivalent coverage with TransUnion, the other major credit bureau, as recommended by the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada?</ParaText><ParaText id="3169314">There are reports that many of the approximately 600,000 affected people have not yet been contacted by HRSDC even though it has been almost three months since the drive was first noticed missing. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169315">According to recent media reports, less than 5,000 individuals have signed up so far for the free credit monitoring service provided by the government, and I reinforce free for most.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169316">Knowing how many of these people have yet to be contacted and the reasons for the delay in being contacted is very important. The possibility that a large number of the affected people are still not aware that their personal information has been breached is unacceptable. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169317">Canadians, and more specifically the people affected in this data breach, need to have confidence that their government is doing everything it can to find out why and how this historic breach occurred, and more important, how the government is going to immediately protect them from the risk of identity fraud.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169318">Canadians should not have to pay for the mistakes of the Conservative government. I respectfully ask that you, Mr. Speaker, grant my request so that hopefully questions will be answered and solutions found to the satisfaction of those affected.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170843" Type="2">Skeena—Bulkley Valley</Affiliation> also offered some precedents, which I would commend to the Chair. I also want to acknowledge the hon. gentleman's sagacity in citing those cases despite the fact he sits in opposition to the government which in its own nature makes me question his sagacity on a number of other issues, but I digress.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169323">Besides the interventions you have already heard, Mr. Speaker, I would like to add two more authorities to those before you to assist the Chair in preparing a ruling.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169324"> As the government House leader remarked in his initial comments last week, the hon. member did not mention one of his parliamentary duties or responsibilities as a member of the House of Commons. Instead he referred to a matter of constituency business.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169325">Page 117 of <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, second edition, offers a categorical summary of how the Chair has approached these issues:</ParaText>

The following passage from page 3470 of <I>Debates</I> would, I suggest, give guidance on distinguishing between occasions when questioning officials is and is not a matter for privilege. Again, I quote:</ParaText><ParaText id="3169328"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Members have an undeniable right to question and obtain information from the government in order to discharge their responsibilities of oversight.

It is not the case, however, that the privilege to seek such information extends to every aspect of a member's activity.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169331">In conclusion, when the facts advanced by the hon. member, regardless of the conclusions taken from them, and I certainly would not share the opposition's spin on them, are considered through the lens of these precedents and those quoted on Friday by the NDP House leader, I would submit there is no prima facie question of privilege to be found here.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Mauril Bélanger (Ottawa—Vanier, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3169332">Mr. Speaker, what did not come through perhaps clearly in what I said, and you will recall the first time I raised this last June, was it was directly related to my duties to prepare for question period. In obtaining information as the Liberal advocate for co-operatives, I needed information through CMHC, which I could not then obtain because it was not allowed to provide the briefing. There is one issue where there is a direct link to my parliamentary responsibilities which cannot be avoided. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169333">The same can be true because I intend to raise questions about this massive development of a military base which has been ceded to the Canada Lands Corporation, but in order to do so, I need to obtain information. Therefore, the two are intrinsically linked.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169334">In you judgment, Mr. Speaker, I hope you would consider also equality of access to information because I did mention, and I would hope you would look into that, that in all my conversations with members on the government side, never have I heard anyone complaining of their inability to access information from the government, just as members of this party and I gather from the House leader of the NDP, members from his party have been impeded from obtaining.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169335">There are two issues here that are directly linked to my parliamentary duties as a member of Parliament representing constituents. </ParaText>

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Blanchette" id="7865535"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170215" Type="2">Mr. Denis Blanchette (Louis-Hébert, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3169344">Mr. Speaker, when I had to interrupt my speech, I was talking about the report on the mediation that was unfortunately not successful. We tried to open a dialogue between the clients and the service provider. We were unable to resolve the problem and that is why we have this bill before us today.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169345">CN and CP wanted nothing to do with this bill. But it might be a kind of wake-up call for these two companies. It is a little bill that does not do too much or ask for much and that we would like to see improved. For the rail companies it is a sign that everything is not just fine.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169346">There are things to improve, and these companies will be tasked with improving them. If they do not, other more restrictive bills will be introduced. Even though, depending on the region, they have either a monopoly or a duopoly, they will have to develop a corporate culture based on customer service. They will have to find a balance between profit and customer service, so that customer service is not sacrificed for the sake of profit. That is the message we must get across.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169347"> I would now like to talk about the vision of transportation as such. In some respects, this bill manages a crisis. We have let the rot set in and we have waited until the very last moment. Minimal action has been taken. However, it is not our job here in the House of Commons to engage in short-term crisis management. Our job is to stamp out a vision for our country for tomorrow, for the day after tomorrow and for decades to come. Right now, we lack this vision. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169348"> I would therefore like to share with you some elements of a vision which has been dubbed, among other things, a national transportation policy. It would be entirely appropriate to address issue. It is my hope that once the bill passes second reading stage and has been referred to a committee, committee members will expand the debate to consider the overall evolution of the rail transportation system.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169349"> We live in a global world. We have a phenomenon called the Internet. It allows a supplier to advertise a product on the web and a customer anywhere in the world to buy that product. The logistics of delivering that product is the ensuing challenge. For Canada, a country of wide open spaces, the rail transportation system is absolutely critical to the process of delivering goods.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169350"> So then, it is important for us to continue focusing on this issue. However, I want to stress the importance of striking a balance. Much has been said about striking a balance between an industry’s ability to make a fair and reasonable profit and the possibility for captive customers to have a service that meets their needs and allows their business to grow. Such a service would help people stay in their regions and prevent a population exodus. It would be one way to develop resource regions. This matter is extremely important to us.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169351"> On the question of balance, we can take it further. We can talk about striking a balance between the transportation of people and freight. Even though there are problems with respect to freight transportation, passenger rail service often takes a back seat to freight transportation. How many times must passenger trains pull over onto a siding to allow a freight train to pass? </ParaText><ParaText id="3169352"> It all comes down to a matter of balance. Therefore, we need to examine all of these aspects and put an end to any short-term vision. We need to come up with a plan for a rail infrastructure worthy of the 21st century. This is important.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="25">(1525)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3169353"> We are still living with an infrastructure that is a holdover from the 19th century, albeit an infrastructure that helped cement our national unity. Why not take another stab at improving it so that the companies that provide the service as well as the users and citizens can all benefit.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169354"> Finally, I want to stress that the main reason we want a national passenger and freight transportation policy in place is to be able to plan and make the right moves at the right time, rather than merely react to situations.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169355"> A business owner always looks to get a positive reaction from customers. Right now, there is no positive response and that is why this legislation is before the House. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169356"> In conclusion, I will say that this is a step in the right direction, a very small step. Everyone has agreed to support it. In fact, everyone is operating on the principle that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. So we are taking this small step today. We hope to improve service to suppliers. We hope the government will accept some of the amendments that will be proposed. Ultimately, we are probably addressing the most glaring part of the problem, but, since there have already been some reports and mediation attempts, and because we at least want to solve certain problems, I believe this requires cooperation by everyone, and especially by the various stakeholders, so that the House has to intervene as little as possible in the development of the railway system. It will be important for citizens, suppliers, customers, the economy and especially for Canada that we resolve that.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

In a fundamental way, it is all a matter of relations between the various groups, quite apart from numbers, profits and services rendered.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169362">What is important, and what will have to be increasingly so, is that some companies do not really have any competition. We have to admit that fact. It was acknowledged in the rail freight service review report, which we have already discussed, that the competition was going to be tough.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169363">So it is important for those businesses to be aware of the fact that, given their internal culture, they will have to start cooperating with others.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169364">In a last-ditch effort, they have started to improve certain types of services, but that is unfortunately too little, too late for this bill.

That fact is undeniable. If there is one thing that CN and CP customers want, it is that their goods be delivered as quickly as possible. That is the problem.

A large proportion of the goods are intended for export. Poor rail transportation services damage the ability of Canadian exporters to compete on the international marketplace, particularly in terms of agricultural products.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169388">Moreover, a number of shippers have difficulty, not just in getting good service, but in getting any service at all. Shippers complain that they are not able to sign freight contracts with the big railway companies. This situation is detrimental to Canadian exporters. Steps must be taken, especially because right now the trade deficit is very high. I would like to point out that the trade deficit reached $2 billion last November.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169389">Statistics show that 80% of railway clients are dissatisfied with the service they receive. As the situation is one of a quasi-monopoly, it is important that the government take action to ensure that clients are better protected. It is the shippers who have to pick up the pieces if their goods do not arrive on time. This causes huge inconveniences.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169390"> When perishables are being shipped, the situation is disastrous, because by the time the goods arrive at their destination, they may be rotten or just not usable. This hinders Canada’s competitive position. For example, Canadian soybean growers are placed at a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis their Argentinian competitors, not because of the quality of their product, but because of unreliable shipments. The growers should not have to bear the cost of this situation. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169391"> Rail transportation of goods is vital in many respects. First of all, since 70% of goods are transported by rail at some point, we need to have an efficient system. Secondly, rail transportation makes it possible to keep trucks off the roads, thereby limiting greenhouse gas emissions that result from the transportation of our goods. By ensuring that a certain number of trucks are not on the roads, we avoid putting additional pressure on our road infrastructures, that do not really need it.</ParaText>

Like my constituents in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="170386" Type="2">Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert</Affiliation>, when I use the highways, I can see many trucks, and I can also see the state of the infrastructure, which is underfunded. Therefore, we need a rail transportation system that is efficient and accessible, so that we do not make the situation worse. Moreover, we need investments to restore our existing infrastructure.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169393"> Inaction on this issue will be costly for the Canadian economy. The situation cannot continue. Inadequate rail service is costly for Canadian businesses, and it is detrimental to the economy and to the labour market.

The proposed arbitration process may be too costly for shippers and require an unfair burden of proof by asking shippers to prove that they need the services of the rail company.</ParaText>

From Montreal, the freight can then be shipped to the Saguenay. The transaction can then be billed in Toronto. Each time, a different person is involved in the process. The system is highly complex and rather daunting for the user. Customers can easily encounter many pitfalls. Another issue is the lack of knowledge of the Quebec market, especially a region like the Saguenay, as well as a strong tendency to apply national standards and rates, allowing little room for regional differences and for contact between a customer and a supplier.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>

The softwood lumber industry was hopeful that the situation would sort itself out after May 23. Whether or not that happens remains to be seen. [Many years later, we can see that the situation has not improved.] However, even though this situation was exceptional, there had been a long-standing shortage of CN rail cars, except for major clients. In an October 8, 1999, report, Quebec's transport ministry stated the following about the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean: “...because of the shortage of rail cars, regional transshipment centres may lose customers—indeed, some already have—to transshipment centres in Quebec City where rail cars are easier to obtain.” This situation does not adequately support regional development, nor does it encourage the NQISL to develop regional markets and seek new clients.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>

The railway, or shipping by rail, is very important in my riding. As I often say in my speeches in this House, the river divides my riding in two, but the railway also does the same thing. This is not just a legacy; it is also a very important economic asset for us. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169520"> To begin, I would like to say a little about my experience since 2011 when I was elected, and even before that time, from what I hear from my constituents and other elected representatives in the region, in particular the mayors, concerning relations with CN and CP. This is very important in connection with the subject we are addressing today.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169521"> We need to look at the role these companies are called on to play in our communities and see what a key role the railway has played in the history of Quebec and of Canada. In any history course, even at the university level, we still talk about the railway as a core element of our country's collective history. When we look at it that way, there is a duty to work with the various stakeholders. Today, we are talking about the stakeholders that ship various products, in the farming sector in particular.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169522"> In my riding, I am in an odd situation when it comes to this subject. On the south shore, Montérégie is located right in the middle between Montreal and the more urban part of the south shore, but also in a somewhat more agricultural and rural area. Let us not forget that there are also farmers in my riding. I can think of neighbouring ridings, like Shefford or Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, where there are people in the farming community who use the railway. We can really see how much the railway connects those regions to Montreal, and beyond there to other destinations, including Quebec City, Ottawa, or the other end of the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169523"> When we consider these facts, we feel we must take action to support our farmers, but we also want to protect the communities living alongside the railways. We therefore need CN to work with us. That is why this bill is important. We are talking about agreements with shippers, but this is also an indication of the need to go beyond that and call on CN to co-operate more on other issues. Those issues all involve the same objective: improving and making better use of the infrastructure we have had for over 100 years now.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169524">Getting back to my previous point, when I was talking about the work I had to do with CN, I have to say that it is not always an easy company to work with, quite frankly. I say that with all due respect because good things have been accomplished. I would not want anyone to think otherwise, and I am definitely ready to work with them. However, the fact that we needed a bill to make CN co-operate on one particular issue shows that the company could do with an attitude adjustment and a little more flexibility given that it has a monopoly or a virtual monopoly on rail services in my region and across Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169525">I have seen this problem on two particular files, including the rail electrification one. This AMT proposal would modernize and improve rail services. It would reduce costs for producers using the services and for public transit users. Yes, it would be expensive in the short term, but in the long term, it would provide economic, environmental and other benefits. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169526">We have had to deal with a lot of problems on this file. CN categorically refused without offering any explanations or agreeing to talk about it. This is another very important aspect of the bill before us today even though it is about a different issue with CN.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3169527">As for the other file, I heard a comment on the other side of the House about increasing train traffic. That is interesting, because that is exactly the kind of thing we want to see. That obviously means that the economy is doing well, including the local economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169528">However, this increase is combined with the phenomenon of urban sprawl, which we are seeing more and more in Montérégie, particularly on the south shore. People are leaving the Island of Montreal to move to the suburbs, including our region. They are building homes around train stations to be able to use public transportation. II am talking about commuter trains. So these homes are seeing an increase in vibrations.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169529">My riding office in Saint-Basile-le-Grand is in an old train station. It is no longer in use, but, obviously, since it is an old train station, we are close to the tracks and we feel the vibrations. It is not a big deal to us. It does not happen too often when employees work from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. or 6 p.m., for example. However, I think everyone can agree that it can be more difficult for someone who lives close by.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169530"> Speaking about the importance of the railway calls to mind some comments made by one of the mayors in my riding. Gilles Plante, the mayor of MacMasterville, told me as well as CN officials that while he did not want to hinder CN’s work or impede rail traffic, he did hope that a happy medium could be found.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169531"> Co-operation with CN on this front is necessary, but not always easy to get. We are still waiting for answers to requests made by citizens regarding rail traffic. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169532"> There is a reason why I bring this up and relate these stories of issues that I have been focusing on since being elected to represent my riding. As I have said before, the aim of the bill is to compel CN to negotiate agreements with shippers to prevent the company from unfairly benefiting from the monopoly it holds over our producers, in particular farmers. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169533"> If I might digress for a moment, I would especially like to congratulate the member for <Affiliation DbId="170633" Type="2">Trinity—Spadina</Affiliation> for her work, for the bill she introduced, which made the minister realize that the time had come to act on this issue.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169534"> This bill is seen as a step in the right direction. However, hard work is needed to sustain this momentum. I am hearing from the farmers in my region and I know that some colleagues represent ridings where farming is even more prevalent. The message is always the same when the topic of public transportation or the railway system comes up. They acknowledge that this is a very important industry, one that needs to be modernized. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169535"> We lag far behind Europe in this area. Of course I am not saying that everything is wrong. I am sure that a government member is prepared to rise and say that everything is going well. I am not saying that things are going badly, but simply because things are not going badly does not mean that things cannot be greatly improved. This is true of the railway system. Things are going very well back home. People benefit from the service, but much more could be done. If improvements were made to the rail infrastructure, the costs in the short term would be great, but in the long term, as I said, users and shippers could enjoy lower prices.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169536"> As far as urban sprawl is concerned, as I said earlier, this is a positive phenomenon. It means that people are settling in our region, that the population is increasing, that more families are moving into the area and that our local economy is thriving. These are things that I am very proud of and very pleased to see. Mainly it drives many of the issues I champion in the House and in my work as a member of Parliament. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3169537"> However, that makes life tough for farmers because municipal elected officials, regional conferences of elected officials, RCMs, members of the National Assembly and so on all wind up facing the same challenges: finding a way to promote urban sprawl and growth back home, but also ensuring that our farmers still have an environment conducive to their production.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169538"> There are a lot of local products in the Richelieu valley, where my constituency is located, and they are the pride of our region. Tourisme Montérégie has done a lot of work, and even in the surrounding areas, in Rougemont near Marieville in my riding or elsewhere, local products are of outstanding quality. People attending the Chambly Bières et Saveurs festival in the summer can enjoy beer—it is very good—as well as superior-quality food products. We want to continue producing those products. They are healthful and good for the economy, and they are also good for our heritage, even though that may seem like a cliché. That, in a way, is our physical and environmental heritage.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169539"> The work we are doing with CN is extremely important: we are looking for a way to juggle the reality of modernization with that of agricultural tradition, which is very important in my riding. That is why I am very pleased to support this bill at second reading. It is a step in the right direction, as a number of my colleagues and I have said.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169540"> However, I believe that the committee work will be very important, and the work to be done over the next few months and years even more so. As I emphasized earlier, we have to prod CN on other issues as well. We have to demand even more from those people and from all stakeholders involved in railway issues, who will show us the way because we find it hard to move CN on these issues.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169541"> I would like to go back to the vibrations issue. This is fundamentally important for this bill because, once again, we are talking about shippers. Freight trains are increasingly long and that is very good. However, we wonder, and we have also put the question to CN, how it is possible to reconcile these two realities. My office is located beside the railway, and I also live near it. Sometimes drivers want to cross the tracks, and it is nearly rush hour and along comes a train transporting freight from elsewhere in Canada. Then they realize that the train is nearly 200 cars long. Sometimes people wait a long time at the stoplight. We realize that some work still has to be done to reconcile this urbanization reality with the fact that these trains have to pass through.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169542">I am not saying that this is not important. I am referring to the situation facing my colleague, the mayor of McMasterville. We want to keep this in our municipalities. We do not want to tear up the railway. It is part of our heritage and we know how much it benefits our communities. No one would ever say otherwise. However, I think we need to do some work on it. This bill urges CN to do something for farmers. We could also urge it to do more for Canadians in the regions.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169543">The railway is such an important part of our heritage. I recall a Knights of Columbus dinner that was held in November. One of the members, Gilbert Desrosiers, who is very well known in my riding, received a painting done by a local artist whose name escapes me at the moment unfortunately. It was a picture of what we, back home, call the black bridge. There is a large CN logo on the bridge. It is hard to miss. Whether you are on the Richelieu highway, on the shore or in a boat on the Richelieu River, you can see this railway bridge. It is practically an institution in our riding. It is part of our heritage.</ParaText>

However, since I have the time, I will again address the issue of the electrification of the rail line. It is very important, and CN’s attitude to this issue poses a problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169546">I often have conversations with my colleagues, who are ministers and members of the National Assembly. We all more or less have the same vision as far as objectives for public transportation are concerned. A common vision in the region is a good thing, and helps steer progress.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169547">On the other hand, it is understandable that the AMT has projects and that CN is a source of friction. Indeed, they have differing interests and their situations are not the same. Yet, what has been most disturbing in this issue is the lack of dialogue. When this decision was made, the AMT did not seem to know why; CN simply said that it was too expensive, that that was that, and that it was no longer in the cards.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169548">Had the original developers of the railway, both in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada, said that building the railway was too expensive, little progress would have been made. That is precisely the kind of mentality that CN and CP need to do away with. We do not deal with CN and CP as much back home, but these companies still have a role to play, and some of my colleagues do deal with them. That kind of mentality cannot be allowed. We know that it is expensive. We know that it is an investment. I believe that, in the long term, it is going to help reduce costs and promote the kind of environment that is so important for our farmers.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169549">For example, the closer one gets to the Cities of Richelieu and Chambly—which are in my riding and are adjacent to the municipality of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, in the riding of Saint-Jean—the more railways there are. However, they are mostly outdated and no longer in use. The municipality would really like to use this infrastructure and space. However, CP is dragging its feet, at least I believe that it is CP that is doing so.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169550">All of this to say that when a municipality wants to use infrastructure and cannot do so, it is extremely problematic. When municipalities ask for answers, there needs to be an immediate dialogue. CN and CP have everything to gain by engaging in such a dialogue. It can only help them to do their job.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169551">A CN representative, who I will not name out of respect, told me that if Canadians were to communicate directly with CN and tell them about their problems, CN would be in a better position to respond. However, that might not be so easy since these issues are localized. That is no secret. Residents in the region communicate with their elected representatives. Residents with those kinds of concerns call their mayor, municipal councillor or member of Parliament.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169552"> When citizens call elected officials and the elected officials contact CN, I think that this corporation should understand that it is time for action. The fact that it does not come directly from a citizen is no excuse not to act. We are very ready to act. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169553"> I appear to be very critical toward CN and CP, but it bears repeating. We understand they have had great success and that they are still successful. However, in certain respects, they must be more open and engage in more dialogue.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169554"> This is why I am pleased that this bill was introduced. The government has decided that these corporations must speak and work with people. There are certain standards to be met. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169555"> If this is representative of things to come in terms of the railway, in my riding in particular, then I will be quite pleased to continue supporting them and engaging in a dialogue with them.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

One of the things he indicated, which I happen to agree with quite strongly, is that it is important that we hold to account companies like CN and CP and others, which are large, private companies that are very profitable, and that we set specific expectations for them. That is why, for example, we brought forward the railway safety bill in the previous Parliament. It was a bill we worked on with other parties to come to an agreement on; then it had to be brought back in this Parliament as well. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169565">The bottom line is that these are private companies, and sometimes when we are making an assessment of whether the money is being put in the right spot, we have to understand the railway system as a network. The member who spoke previously talked about how his freight rail service is now down to a class 2, which limits the speed to 25 miles per hour for freight. That is actually quite serviceable for freight, although not perfect. He spoke about having a derailment. Obviously, that is something we want to avoid. That is why we brought in the railway safety bill. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169566">However, when we are talking about investments into rail, as an example, perhaps the greatest investment we could make to improve the efficiency of the Port of Montreal would be to improve the railway tunnel in the city of Windsor.

We agree on that, but when we consider the fact that the infrastructure was built by people from our region and elsewhere and that a lot of money has been invested in it, and also the government’s responsibility to ensure that we have a proper rail network, there is good reason for more dialogue between the government and CN and CP.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169572"> With this bill, certain obligations will be instituted, but this is the kind of dialogue that will happen more often.

Issues have really been outstanding since 2007, because that is when industry, in particular individuals who rely heavily on shipping, said they needed to have some sort of legislative manner to start dealing with levels of service. There is a sense of optimism that finally we might see some sort of a bona fide service level agreement put into place, where ultimately there is a consequence or a potential for penalties and so forth. However, it is important that they be enforceable.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169575">I wonder if the member would provide comment in terms of that aspect of the legislation, which seems to suggest that we would have some form of service level agreements that would appease a great number of the different stakeholders, on the condition that it is enforceable, that there are penalties, that it would provide for a better quality of service. That is one of the driving forces behind this debate. Shippers want to see better quality shipping being conducted, better service levels so when they want, need and have paid for a car that it will be there for the shipping of their product.

This is certainly something positive. However, there are obviously consequences associated with passing a bill like this one.

We do want shippers to have the tools they need in order to take full advantage of this legislation. It is quite important that CN and CP be called on to make better agreements with shippers. But that may still pose a problem if the legislation and the legal situation tilt too heavily in favour of the railway companies.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169578">My colleague and I have raised two very important points relating to arbitration, to ensure that we enact legislation that has teeth.

Therefore, the ones that could command the greatest use of the railway had greater opportunities to strike better deals. The problems lay in a stronger fashion with those that did not have the quantity and the continuity of freighting that would attract the rail systems.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169582">I remember meeting with the pulse association, people who provide agricultural products that are not grain but beans, soy, peas and that measure of agricultural product, which is growing considerably in Canada but in smaller batches in different areas across the country. Their problems with getting their product through the rail system were paramount to them. They said they could not deal with the system as it is right now. The types of producers, the locations of those producers across the country and the nature of the product meant that the rail companies were not attracted to them as customers as much as they were to larger producers. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169583">I will be very interested to see how it will play out across western Canada now with the loss of the single desk for grain, how that will play out with small producers, smaller aggregations of those who are moving grain. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169584">The Conservatives sold the idea of getting rid of the single desk on the basis of enabling grain to be moved to different places by the producers in a fashion that would allow them to value-add to their product. Let us see what happens when this occurs in a system where the need for freight is paramount, where we have to move the product and where farmers are not protected by the larger system that existed under the single desk. We will see what that does and how it works. I am sure the committee will hear representation on that matter as well, as it moves forward.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169585">In looking at the rail system, we have heard a lot of talk about infrastructure. The parliamentary secretary mentioned the great investments that the government has made in the rail system. I would raise, for instance, the investment the government is making in one of the big problems with our rail system, the level crossings. There are some 1,400 level crossings in this country. They are being added to incrementally by municipalities all across the country. The Conservatives identified $27 million a year over five years to invest in level crossings. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169586">When we do the math, that does not turn out to be something that will really solve the problem we have with level crossings. Some level crossings can cost between $30 million and $40 million to fix. These are major requirements in the rail system.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169587">If we take a good look at it, the rail companies are not primarily responsible for what has happened with level crossings. This is a co-operative effort that extends across governments, provincial highway authorities and municipal governments. Everyone has a hand in level crossings. Why does the federal government have to play a role? The federal government can be the final arbitrator there. With the profits rail companies are making, they should be a big part of this as well.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3169588">Of course, the government does not collect taxes in a decent fashion from corporations that actually make profits, and cannot reinvest for the public good and the good of those corporations. The chances of the infrastructure issues, that is, of rail being fixed across this country, are very remote if the present spending level of the federal government continues.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169589">I am glad that the NDP has such a strong transport critic today, one who has pushed very hard on these issues. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169590">The service agreement review went through and finished in 2011. Members are now seeing an act in front of Parliament, Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169591">The first part of the bill sets up terms and conditions for contracts for railways and shippers. If a shipper wants to enter into a contract with a rail company, it can describe the traffic to which it relates, the services requested by the shipper in respect to the traffic, and the undertaking the shipper is prepared to give to the rail company with respect to traffic for services. How will one make sure that the rail companies will be well served when their cars arrive? How will all of this fit together?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169592">Contracts, of course, do not apply to written agreements already in place. A company that has already established a written contract with a rail company is not available to deal with this under this legislation. They are locked in.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169593">In the case of many of the larger producers, that may be to their advantage. They do not have to renegotiate anything. The ones that provide a lot of freight movement have a deal set up. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169594">Seeing what is happening in the industry here with the failure of the pipelines that have been proposed for Canada, I would say that we are going to see greater rail traffic carrying oil and gas products across this country. That may change the dynamics of the rail system as well. The larger producers may find themselves competing with other very large producers as well. We will see how that plays out.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169595">The second part of the bill deals with arbitration. Once one has established a contract or is unable to agree on a contract, there is a process of arbitration. That is good because, of course, it is sometimes very difficult to come to agreements. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169596">Small producers in a remote location are looking for the rail company to arrive in a good fashion with the cars. They are going to leave them there. The cars are going to be in good shape. They are going to take the cars away after they have them filled. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169597">There are many variations that have to be examined in a contract between two parties that carry out this kind of work. Is the shipper going to be ready to provide the product to fill all those cars when they are delivered at the site? If they are not, is there some measure of compensation to the company for leaving the cars there longer? If the company does not supply the cars in a good fashion, is there a way to compensate the shipper, who may be backlogged at the receiving area with the other mode of transportation that caused them to bring it to the railway? These are complex, detailed issues that have to be worked out between shippers and the rail company. Of course they will require some arbitration.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169598">What is the hammer that the company keeps under this legislation when it comes to negotiating or dealing with arbitration? Under proposed subsection 169.31(4), the following applies:</ParaText><ParaText id="3169599"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">For greater certainty, neither a rate for the movement of the traffic nor the amount of a charge for that movement or for the provision of incidental services is to be subject to arbitration.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3169600">There is the hammer for the company. It can set the rate for the cars sitting in the dock. It can set the rate for the movement of the material out of the area. It can decide the nature of the movement, the volume of the movement taking place, and how cost effective that is with its service charges that fit over top of that. All of those issues are not going to be subject to arbitration.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169601">The company holds a very strong hand there when it comes to exactly what it is going to cost to do the work. Still, the arbitration should take into account the rates. In any business arrangement, the rates are very important. They cannot simply say “We are going to have a service contract, and you do not get to talk about the rates. The only thing you can talk about is what is going to happen”. Those two things have to work together.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169602">The government, by excluding that from arbitration, has given the rail companies a very strong position in Bill C-52. I hope that it will be seen in committee as something that needs to be worked on. There needs to be some work done to make this fairer, more equitable to all of those concerned, especially the small producers across this country who do not have the leverage to make the deals, as was the case even before this bill.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169603">After this bill there should be some leverage for those small companies so they can make sure that services are being provided to them in a good fashion at a reasonable rate. That is what we should be doing in government, being fair to both sides. The basis of government is trying to come up with solutions that work for all parties.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169604">Some of the other concerns here also fit with small companies, the small shippers, such as the degree of difficulty they may have in working in arbitration, the timeframes that are outlined, the process that is outlined, all of which are very complex and very expensive. The costs will have to be borne by the shipper. The cost of the arbitration is to be split equally between the shipper and the rail company in all cases, according to this legislation. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169605">How does that work? If the arbitration is in favour of the small shipper, they still have to pay the piper for the work they have done.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169606">What I would like to see in this is some means of establishing rates and conditions that would apply across the country, so that some kind of equivalency develops among the arbitration systems and that, across the country, what is decided in one place has some relevance to what is going on in another, so that we have some fairness in the system.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169607">I do not see that yet. Perhaps some of my Conservative colleagues who may have some ideas about that may want to express them. I think it is more likely to be taken up in committee, however. This bill needs a lot of work.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169608">What is the record of this majority Conservative government in offering up amendments? I have to say it is abysmal. It is totally abysmal. These people do not believe in amendments. The Conservatives believe that what they put forward is good enough for the country. They are in charge and they know what is right. This is what has happened with almost every single piece of legislation that has gone through the House to date.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169609">Where are the amendments?

Of course, railways, CP and CN, are among the most heavily invested in by funds that are seeking solid, stable investments, such as OMERS pension fund and the Ontario teachers' pension fund and Canada pension plan and, of course, a wide range of private sector pension funds that look after members like the Canadian Auto Workers and so forth.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169621">When the government takes less from those companies, it actually builds up their investments and pension portfolios, which is important, because we all have a stake in that, each and every Canadian in this country. Therefore, it is important that we do that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169622">He also mentioned that the bill would not get into rates. One of the reasons the bill does not get into rates is that the sector is already regulated in that regard. The industry actually has North American standards with respect to freight rates. These are put onto charts and railways actually work off those charts, and rates can be determined very easily as a result.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169623">It is important that we have that because what we really have in many cases is a virtual monopoly. However, it is competitive from the standpoint that it is regulated and the government already looks at standardized rates for all North American railways.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169624">One of the things that is really important to recognize, which I think the member does have an interest in, is that when we are looking at new development and how we are going to encourage investment in, for example, plan nord in Quebec or the Ring of Fire in Ontario or all of the natural resource wealth that extends into the territory the member represents, how are we going to ensure that these companies are prepared to make the investments, and the service requirements are met by these companies in those areas so that we can in fact explore these resources for the benefit of all Canadians?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

There is no separation into hard and fast units. Rail, and the way it has developed in Canada, has engaged most segments of our society. That is why government has a very important role. However, if government does not collect the money, it cannot invest. It is pretty straightforward.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169628">There may be North American rates. However, quite clearly, there is also the provision of incidental services. I am sure that there is a lot of fudge room within those rates. Nothing can be delivered at the same price in the same time. Volume counts. The type of delivery and the conditions make a difference. All these things add to cost or take away from cost. To not have them in arbitration, to not have the finesse of the system available for arbitration, I think is something that will inevitably lead to abuse.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We know that 80% of railway users are dissatisfied with the service provided.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169643">It is important to say that some amendments will have to be made in committee. The bill must be improved so that rail transportation really improves in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169644">After years of discussions, the Conservatives finally introduced a bill in response to a number of complaints from rail customers that received inferior service from the major railway companies for a very long time. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169645"> I would like to go back to the speech by my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170102" Type="2">Chambly—Borduas</Affiliation>. Earlier he referred to the railway as part of Canada's heritage and to the sense of belonging that people attach to the railway in Canada. In my opinion and that of the member for Chambly—Borduas, that makes it more important to invest properly in this mode of transport, a fundamentally important one in a country such as Canada, which is very large and sparsely populated.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169646"> It is also important to say that everyone must come out a winner: the railways but also rail transport service customers, such as farmers and mining companies, which are often victims of the railways' virtual monopolies. We are talking about service disruptions, delays and disturbances that hurt the agriculture, forest products, mining and manufacturing sectors, which are not compensated for the losses.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169647"> A large portion of those goods is intended for export, which is very important for Canada's economy. Those sectors must be able to rely on effective transport in order to export their goods, not to mention the fact that many goods, as in the agricultural sector, are perishable. Producers therefore cannot afford major delays or service disruptions. Their products must be exported immediately.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169648"> Shippers have difficulty obtaining fair, reliable rail transport services. Some are not even able to secure contracts with major railway companies, and those that have contracts often suffer long delays or simply do not have enough cars at their disposal.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169649"> This entire situation undermines the ability of Canadian exporters to remain competitive in international markets, particularly agricultural products markets, as I said earlier. Farmers already face numerous uncontrollable challenges. Consider weather issues, for example, such as early frosts, excessive rain or too much sun. Farmers already deal with situations that are not easy to handle. That is the case with all farmers in my riding: we never know what will happen with the harvests, whether we will manage to make it to the end or whether everything will go well. The government thus has some responsibility toward these people, who feed Canada's population, and it must assist them, in particular by guaranteeing that their goods are efficiently transported. That is already a first step.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169650"> Following years of discussion, expert panels, an attempt at mediation and consultations with stakeholders, the Conservatives ultimately had no choice but to introduce a bill in late 2012, not very long ago.</ParaText>

I think that its wording is a bit ambiguous, which could create some loopholes. That will have to be considered in committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169653">The committee will also have to consider the stakeholders affected by the problems, so it will have to consult farmers, for example, as well as stakeholders from the forestry and mining industries.

							<ParaText id="3169680">Rail freight customers from farmers to mining companies are suffering from the virtual monopoly of power of the railway companies. In most parts of the country shippers cannot choose between rail service providers because they only have access to either CN or CP. Even in a few places where both rail companies provide access, one is virtually priced out of the market, leaving the shipper with no real choice. Shippers routinely suffer from service disruptions, delays and various forms of non-performance by CP and CN. Deliveries and pickups are not done on time or skipped completely. Frequently the number of ordered rail cars is not matched by the delivered rail cars and sometimes cars are damaged. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169681">A broad range of industries are affected by the situation, especially agriculture, forestry and mining. In western Canada these industries play a significant part in the economy. Chemical and automotive businesses in the rest of Canada are also affected. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169682">A large portion of these goods are destined for export. Lacklustre rail services are thus hurting Canadian exporters' abilities to compete in global markets. For example, soybeans from Argentina enjoy a competitive advantage in markets such as Japan and China because they are delivered faster and more punctual than soybeans from Canada, despite the fact that the total distance covered is significantly shorter for products from Canada. For years shippers have been unhappy but no concrete action was taken by the Conservatives.

The private member's bill, coupled with advocacy work from the shipping community, put pressure on the minister to follow up on his promise and actually table legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169685">The shipping community is organized in a coalition of rail shippers.

Canada is one of the rare countries to have made that kind of choice.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169710"> I will leave it to my colleagues to imagine the passenger transportation challenges that await us in the years to come given that the coalition of private shippers has been complaining for years about the poor quality of the services they receive, and they are the priority clients.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169711"> Rail shipping is the backbone of the Canadian economy. Over 70% of all goods shipped by land go by train. The reason is relatively easy to understand: you do not need a university degree in geography to see that in our country, rail shipping is often bulk, and it would be difficult to replace it with shipping by truck. And shipping by boat, which is sometimes more economical than by train, is not available everywhere, for fairly obvious reasons.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169712"> Canada was built by the train, and the railway is a vital link between communities in an enormous country. So we might be surprised at the present state and poor quality of rail shipping services. The Conservative government is not the only one responsible for this situation, but it is guilty of not tackling the problem head on in time to rectify this situation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169713"> Day in and day out, the Conservative government claims to be working for the Canadian economy, but everywhere in the country, businesses are suffering from unreliable service, the result of which is hundreds of millions of dollars in economic losses every year. In addition, poor service leads to higher prices for some goods, chemical fertilizers being one example.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169714"> To put it more simply, over 80% of rail shipping services customers are not satisfied with the services provided by rail carriers—in other words, nearly everyone. This is 80% of loyal customers. MPs may have experienced this themselves, as customers of a store or a business. They may have started by getting excellent offers so they would become customers, but as soon as they became regular customers, they were taken for granted. And then their relationship gradually deteriorated and all the benefits were offered to new customers to expand the customer base.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169715"> That is something we see in Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>, when it says that agreements governed by the new law will be made only with new customers, new contracts. And so anyone who has been using the services for years, and who is a long-standing loyal customer—if we can talk about loyalty in the case of a virtual monopoly—will not have access to the same rules that Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> seeks to put in place.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3169716">Clearly, there is room for improvement. We could make these improvements in committee if the government would be open enough to come to the table and participate in meaningful discussions and listen to the best suggestions to get the best bill possible.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169717">I would like to come back to the fact that 80% of customers are dissatisfied. Something had to be done and something still urgently needs to be done, but the Conservatives clearly have not done anything because this matter has been dragging on not just for weeks and months but for years.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169718">Why have the Conservatives taken so long to do something? Here is what I think may be happening.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169719">First, rail freight customers are often farmers or mining companies. These customers have to deal with large railways that have a virtual monopoly over rail transport. I spoke about this earlier.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169720">In most regions of the country, shippers cannot choose a rail transportation company because they have access to only one or the other. Even in cases where the two railway companies are present, the competition struggles to play the role it should and to influence the basic economic principle of supply and demand.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169721">Why do we now have to legislate? Why can the stakeholders not come to an agreement among themselves? In all likelihood, CN and CP benefit from the tacit support of the Conservative government and, in that context, they are not at all prepared to make real concessions.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169722">The result, as has been mentioned, is that 80% of rail freight customers—shippers—are not satisfied with rail freight service. So, of course, they have asked the government to take action and to introduce legislation that would require CN and CP to reach agreements on the level of service provided to shippers. After years of empty words, the Conservatives are now being forced to act as a result of pressure from the shipping community and the NDP.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169723">Under duress, the Conservatives finally introduced a bill designed to solve some of these problems after the NDP critic's bill was introduced last spring. That bill, which was entitled the Rail Customer Protection Act, was much clearer and covered all customers.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169724">The government is using half-measures. Quite frankly, although the Conservatives' bill is a step forward, it is a weak step. Here are some reasons: the protective measures do not cover existing contracts between shippers and rail transport companies; the bill offers only a limited arbitration process for unsuccessful negotiations of new contracts; the arbitration is available only for shippers who are negotiating new contracts instead of providing fast and reliable help for all shippers; Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> will cover only new service level agreements, not those that already exist. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169725">Furthermore, the fines mentioned in Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> would go to the government and not the shippers. We could talk all night about the amount of these fines, which seem a bit weak to me for such big companies. The ability to interact, discuss and negotiate is undermined when the fines go into the government's pocket, which supports what I was saying earlier that, rightly or wrongly, CN and CP probably feel like the Conservative government is in their corner.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169726">I will move on from what is missing from the bill, since I am running out of time. I will no doubt have an opportunity to speak more to this in committee. I have a short conclusion.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169727">Rail transport is not the only file on which the Conservatives have been dragging their feet. They implemented new railway safety measures. They made cuts to VIA Rail Canada and prevented the introduction of high-speed rail in Canada.</ParaText>

Perhaps "angry" is a bit strong. Exasperated may be a better word.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169752">What could I find so exasperating in an attempt to provide recourse for unsatisfied users of rail shipping services? It is very simple. It is as though the government is pretending to fix the problem to give the illusion that it is taking action. Members will notice that I said "exasperating" and not "surprising", since this is becoming a trend.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169753">Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> is another example of the Conservative government's chronic mismanagement. Rail transportation fuels Canada's economy. Of all the countries in the world, Canada is one that was built by the railway. The railway was behind every aspect of our growth.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169754">The quality of rail infrastructure still has a direct impact on Canada's entire economy today. This is not news to the government; it knows that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169755">Usually, the Conservative government—as patriotic as ever—would defend our businesses' access to the rail system. Nearly 150 years ago, at the start of our Confederation's growth, it was the country's lifeblood. It was an almost heroic era when Canada dreamt of defying the world.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169756">That was the 19th century. While the situation is quite different today, it is easy to explain. Rail companies are extremely prosperous and make ridiculous profits. And that is understandable because without them, Canada would be paralyzed and would have almost no economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169757">A crucial detail that I should point out, even though it may be useless to do so, is that there are only two rail companies in Canada. The minister spoke of a “duopoly” when describing the situation, and that was fine in the first hour of discussion. But I do not like that term because “duo” means “together”, not just “two”. And that is the crux of the issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169758">The ridiculous profits I mentioned keep piling up. Let us face it, there really is no competition. These two companies share all of Canada's rail transportation business and more, and they always have. These are two major, historic Canadian companies, if we can still call them Canadian now that they have been privatized.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169759">That is the government's only motivation: do not upset the large corporations that are raking in huge profits. If any disputes arise between those companies and the small shippers, let us give the companies the power to shut them up quickly. Some would even say with nickels and dimes.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169760">One might speak out and say that it is counter productive, that it is irrational to do that. Yes, that is true, but this would be forgetting that, first and foremost, these people, the government and the railway companies, know each other and talk to one another. These people are perhaps not exactly in collusion, but they definitely share certain sympathies. Yes, they are sympathetic to one another.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169761">In addition, in the intellectual shackles of puritanism, which is the basis of the entire Conservative approach, it is clear that the fittest gets his power directly from God and must not be opposed. Success comes from God almighty. Put that all together and there you have the inspiration for Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> and for everything else, of course.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169762">Here is what bothers me about the result, Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>. I already know how the Conservatives will respond: “The economic recovery is too fragile. We must not make any waves. We have to ensure that we have everything going for us. We cannot do anything to compromise the railways' efficiency, not for the measly crumbs, not for a company worth, at worst, $100,000.” </ParaText><ParaText id="3169763">After all, we are not reinventing ourselves. These people are not likely to engage in such deep reflection now in the middle of February.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169764">This is the same old story. After dragging its feet for so long, now the government is stubbornly defending a characteristically weak and contemptuous bill. Let us rename it: Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document>, an act that says that railway companies can break any contract they like for $100,000, and be done with it. What a bargain. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169765">Rail lines are real structures that result in exchanges and economic benefits that are just as real. There is a direct impact at all levels of economic life. If remote shippers can no longer rely on the two national companies, they might not exist at all. If shippers are neglected, they and their communities are not being allowed to participate in the country's development.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169766">All paths starting on the margins lead to the centre. Coming from a government that claims it will leave no stone unturned to achieve prosperity, it is rather strange. For people who take every opportunity to proclaim to the world that supporting the right is the best way to ensure the well-being of business, it is more than revealing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169767">Is that the Conservative government's great recovery plan for outlying regions? Yes, undoubtedly. Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> is striking proof. Develop resources, process them, but do not try to sell them because all the railway cars are taken. This is more proof that there is no plan and that this will have to wait, again. However, be happy, there are a lot of people lined up to talk to the government and you can chat with them. There is the manufacturing sector, my entire generation and all aboriginal peoples of Canada. You will surely find something to talk about to pass the time.</ParaText>

I say "colleague" because that is how we refer to each other here, even though I would prefer to use a word that better represents the respect I have for her. She not only wants to do everything, she can do everything. If the official opposition transport critic says that she has met with all of the stakeholders, it means that she has met with all of the stakeholders, even the ones who were hiding. And if she says that a clear majority does not like anything in this bill, it means that there is damning and incontrovertible evidence. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169769">The government can pull all kinds of adjectives out of the <I>Oxford English Dictionary</I> to defend itself, evade the issue and have us believe it worked very hard to restore balance, but no one is listening. That is what I find so exasperating. I hope I am being clear. I find the gaps in logic between what this government claims it is doing and what it is actually doing appalling. The urgent need to fix the problems with the rail companies was a perfect opportunity for the overconfident Conservative government to show that it could do its job. And what happens? It is the first to jump into bed with the rail companies. Nothing gets in the way of love, not even having the lights out.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169770">When Canada has a problem, it would make sense to look elsewhere to see if other countries have found solutions, not to copy them, but to at least draw some inspiration from them. We do not live in a vacuum. And I mean that in a geographic sense, because intellectually speaking, it is obvious that the other side has sucked people in with their empty rhetoric.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169771">Over the past 50 or so years in Canada, the concern that we used to have for our rail system has all but faded. When passenger rail travel became less common, trains and the incredible rail system that stretches like fingers across the country no longer captured our imagination as they once did. The superhuman effort that rallied half a continent quickly died. Yet trains in Europe are flourishing. How often have I heard Quebeckers talk about travelling in Europe and how astounded they were by the quality of rail infrastructure in the European Union?</ParaText><ParaText id="3169772">The pride that you feel is overwhelming when you arrive at Berlin's central station and see “Bombardier” in huge, white letters in the middle of the large window. But you quickly see the unbelievable difference between the European trains that Bombardier builds and the antiquated trains we have here because there is no political will.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169773">The European Union will stop at nothing to ensure that its rail system, which is a huge tangled web of railways that it inherited from the national systems of 27—soon to be 28—countries, is the most competitive in the world. Europe understands our own historical example better than we do ourselves. Without an outstanding, competitive rail system, our country would almost not exist. Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> may look like a simple legal adjustment concerning a situation that the public can quietly neglect. In fact, quite the opposite is true: it is the government that is neglecting it. When blood flow is cut off to an organ, it dries up and dies. And <I>nolens volens</I>, the rest of the organism will die along with it. That may be a somewhat silly and dramatic image, but it is fair to a certain extent.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169774">In closing, a country is like a house and Canada is like a house built on a beautiful, huge plot of land. It is a land of dreams. We can build little out buildings, create gardens and build a chicken coop. The house itself, which is already huge, could easily be improved, since we have the wood and the carpenters needed to do so. When the NDP has the last word in the affairs of the house, we will work hard to make this house, which we all share, more comfortable, more manageable and even more beautiful. We will add new rooms for children and grandparents, as well as a library and bicycle storage.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169775">For years the Liberals spent their time changing the carpets and arguing about what to call the house, and the Conservatives boarded up the windows because it was too drafty and heating is too expensive.

The right-wing faction should understand that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169776">The Conservatives need to create jobs in rail transportation instead of allowing themselves to be wooed by the rail companies who have everything to gain by seducing them.

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Mathyssen" id="7866775"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170153" Type="2">Ms. Irene Mathyssen (London—Fanshawe, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3169792">Mr. Speaker, rail freight customers, from farmers to mining companies, are suffering because railway companies have a virtual monopoly when it comes to the vital rail lines that Canadians need to get goods to market.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169793">In most parts of the country shippers cannot choose between rail services because they only have access to either CN or CP. Even in the few places where both rail companies provide access, one is usually priced out of the market, leaving the shipper with no real choice.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169794">Shippers routinely suffer from service disruptions, delays and experience all kinds of examples of non-reliable performance by CN and CP. Deliveries and pickups are not done on time or are skipped completely. Frequently the number of ordered railcars is not matched by the delivered number of railcars and sometimes cars are badly damaged.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169795">When a shipper contracts a specific number of railcars, that shipper needs to know those cars will be available. Anything other than this kind of reliability is bad business and bad management. Unfortunately, we know that 80% of the service commitments for agricultural rail customers are not met by rail companies.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169796">After years of talking, the Conservatives have finally tabled legislation to address a number of key rail freight customer grievances after years of inferior service by the big rail companies. Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> is a step forward, but is far from a perfect solution.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169797">Key demands from the shipping community have, quite simply, not been addressed. Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> would also create loopholes because of its ambiguous language. The Conservative language is weak. Its protective measures do not cover existing contracts between shippers and rail companies and offers only a narrow, costly arbitration process for failed negotiations for new contracts. Key demands like the shippers' call to include penalties for rail companies in service agreements, performance standards and an easily accessible conflict resolution process were ignored.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169798">While NDP members will support this legislation, we will also push for amendments at the committee stage to protect shippers from the abuse of market power through the right to comprehensive service agreements and conflict resolution processes.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169799">Rail transport is the backbone of Canada's economy, with 70% of all surface goods shipped by rail. It is crucial to make rail freight services work for both rail companies and shippers. We cannot take the importance of the railroad for granted. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169800">It is also critical to note that current pricing for rail freight services is also damaging Canada's shippers. Bill <Document DbId="5926164" Type="3">C-52</Document> explicitly excludes pricing, despite the calls from all parts of the shipping community to address the pricing regime. This has a significant impact on Canada's trade deficit, which is, by the way, ballooning. It reached almost $2 billion in November alone. We cannot afford to lose even more ground when it comes to global competitiveness for Canada's products.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169801">A broad range of industries are affected by the situation created by the virtual monopoly of current rail service providers. I have already mentioned agriculture, but we must not forget other key industries like forestry and mining as well as chemical and automotive businesses. Many of the goods produced by these industries are destined for export. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169802">Lacklustre rail services are hurting Canada's exporters' ability to compete in global markets. For example, soybeans from Argentina enjoy a competitive advantage in markets like Japan and China because they are delivered faster and more punctually than soybeans from Canada, despite the fact that the total distance that needs to be covered is significantly shorter for products from Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169803">Rail freight is not only central to Canada's economy; we also need strong rail freight services to take trucks off the road and tackle greenhouse gas emissions. While the overall share of surface transport for goods remains high for rail, frustrated companies switch to trucking where possible and the environment loses. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169804">Rail freight is only one aspect where the Conservatives are slow to act. From new rail safety measures to cuts at VIA Rail and blocking the introduction of high-speed rail in Canada, Conservatives do not give Canada's rail network the attention it deserves.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="25">(1825)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3169805">The bill has taken a long time to come to the House. For years, shippers have been unhappy but no concrete action was taken by the Conservatives. Since 2007 they employed a talk it out and wait tactic, starting with the promise of an expert panel review.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169806">The rail freight service review started in 2008. The independent panel tabled its final report in early 2011. Half a year later in the fall of 2011, the Conservatives initiated a mediation process that did not yield any results. Presumably with the tacit backing from the Conservative government, CN and CP were unwilling to make any meaningful concessions. The mediation process, led by retired Conservative politician and University of Calgary chancellor Jim Dinning, failed. Dinning released his report in June 2012 and the <Affiliation DbId="170701" Type="96">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> promised government legislation on the topic to be tabled in the fall.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169807">Parallel to the end of the mediation process, fortunately, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170633" Type="2">Trinity—Spadina</Affiliation> tabled private member's Bill <Document DbId="5620079" Type="4">C-441</Document>, the rail customer protection act, in June 2012. The private member's bill by the member for Trinity—Spadina, coupled with advocacy work from the shipping community, put pressure on the minister to follow up on his promise to actually table legislation. However, CN undertook a massive lobbying effort last year, first to prevent any effective bill, then to have it watered down. Dozens of documented visits to government offices and a media campaign show the determination of CN to keep the status quo.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169808">Rail customers have banded together now and are organized in the Coalition of Rail Shippers. The coalition is a loose and informal entity, but it wants something positive for its industry. It wants something positive for the people who produce the goods, who create the wealth in this country, the men and women who do the work to make this country tick and be productive.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169809">Shippers are having a hard time getting fair and reliable freight service, and that is simply unacceptable. We can and should do better for those that rely on our rail system. Our manufacturers, farmers and resource industries depend on our rail system. If rail were made more fair and affordable, consumers would also see an advantage.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169810">This is a country that emerged as a strong, independent nation because of the accessibility of our railways.

I talked to Aéroports de Montréal (ADM) about this, and I was told that there was no security protocol for the airport's blueprints.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169814">The government says that it is a proponent of security and that it has invested in airport security. However, blueprints of a secure area, where photos cannot even be taken, were found in a recycling bin. ADM's obvious lack of security with respect to blueprints of its premises is also indicative of a more fundamental problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169815">Aéroports de Montréal, a non-profit organization, does not have to account to virtually anyone. The people who manage this organization, which is vital to our economy, are exempt from any serious and transparent independent audit.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169816">The Auditor General of Canada cannot even conduct a financial or environmental audit of ADM's books. With respect to aircraft noise, ADM is both judge and jury. In terms of public health and the environment, ADM does not even obey Quebec laws because it is a federal entity. Worst of all, the federal government cannot even conduct its own audits of ADM. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169817">Having control over ports and airports is of strategic importance to a nation. But the public and elected officials are being duped. Management of the ADM reminds me of the kind of governance we saw in the 19th century, before the Patriotes Rebellion in Upper Canada and Lower Canada. At the time, parliamentarians and the public were calling for government accountability. The English governor had control over public goods and services for his friends, and ignored the people most directly concerned, the public and elected officials.<Sup></Sup></ParaText><ParaText id="3169818">We can understand the government giving up its responsibilities, but it must let the Government of Quebec have authority over its ports and airports and put an end to the lack of transparency and gross incompetence on the part of the ADM.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We were very concerned about this situation, which was clearly communicated to the airport authority in Montreal during a call between the <Affiliation DbId="170700" Type="4">Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities</Affiliation> and the CEO, James Cherry.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169821">Even though the documents in question did not contain any sensitive information on airport security, this government absolutely wants to maintain the safest aviation networks in the world.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169822">Transport Canada, Canada's aviation industry and other safety partners have worked hard to promote a culture of safety awareness across the country, since such tragedies as Air India flight 182 and, obviously, the September 11 terrorist attack.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169823">Security awareness is a culture in which security is everybody's business. If you see something suspicious, you report it to the appropriate authorities. The fact that this happened gives us an opportunity to learn and to improve our security system in the airport industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169824">The member's question gives me an opportunity to discuss what is in place to manage security at airports, including how sensitive documents are handled.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169825">In January 2012, the government modernized our aviation security regulations, including new requirements to better manage security at airports. For instance, the regulations prohibit airport operators from divulging sensitive information. The regulations also require them to have procedures in place for the receiving, retaining and disposing of security-related documents. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169826">Transport Canada security inspectors examine those documents. This includes preparing procedures, knowing who is responsible for sensitive information, how the documents should be stored and the process for sharing and destroying information on security.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169827">The modernization of the Canadian Aviation Security Regulations, 2012 also requires airport operators to designate an individual to be responsible for managing security and to clearly define the roles and responsibilities related to security for people at the airport.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169828">Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me this opportunity to talk about security.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

However, when I spoke with ADM, I was told that there was no security protocol for all airport blueprints and that there was a security protocol for some security contracts but that others were granted without a competitive bidding process. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169830">When I heard that, I made a written access to information request in accordance with parliamentary procedure. I asked what relationship existed between ADM and Construction Gastier. I wanted to know if they rented them any space and if so, how much. I wanted to know whether there were contracts between Construction Gastier and ADM and whether a competitive bidding process had been held for certain contracts.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169831">I therefore submitted a series of written questions. Unfortunately, the minister responded to me by saying that Transport Canada does not interfere in the management of ADM's day-to-day business, that ADM had full responsibility for managing this, that the company was completely independent and could do what it wanted, and that parliamentarians have no oversight. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169832">That is dangerous, especially when we see what is happening right now at the Charbonneau commission.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It is well known that millions of dollars in government resources were wasted on surveillance of Ms. Blackstock to discredit her. That is in keeping with the government's propensity to shoot the messenger instead of addressing the issue. However, the issue is bigger than any individual and is proving to be the government's biggest test. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169837">The scourge of poverty in Canada's aboriginal community leads to any number of negative outcomes. Much of the discontent we are seeing in Canada's first nations, Inuit and Métis communities has roots in the inequity and the challenges that arise from it. In fact, in 2008, the Auditor General confirmed that substantial shortfalls in federal child welfare funding on reserves are jeopardizing children's safety. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169838">The money the government wasted spying on Ms. Blackstock would have been better used addressing any number of pressing issues that would actually make a difference. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169839">When coupled with frozen and inadequate budgets for education, the penny-pinching on welfare services entrenches a cycle of dependence that must be addressed if we are going to help create the conditions that will allow this generation to lift itself out of poverty. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169840">It is well known that education in Canada's aboriginal communities is chronically under-funded and contributes significantly to the low number of high school graduates. For every ten children on reserve, only four will graduate high school. That limits employment opportunities, which in turn limits incomes and contributes to the cycle of poverty. With poverty comes health challenges and these same communities face inordinate rates of diabetes, suicide and the fastest growing rate of HIV infection in Canada. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169841">What is discouraging is how the government has shown an incredible lack of concern on these issues. Last week, the House debated a New Democrat motion to recognize the broad based demand for action and the need for improvement of the economic outcomes of first nations, Inuit and Métis communities. New Democrats believe these challenges should be a central focus for budget 2013. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169842">The government has to commit to action on treaty implementation and engage in full and meaningful consultation on legislation that affects the rights of aboriginal Canadians. This is not something we pulled out of thin air. Canada is required by domestic and international law to engage in these consultations and it is the only path forward that has any hope of truly changing outcomes for many of these communities. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169843">In terms of unilateral action, there are avenues open to the government. It is entirely within the government's abilities to increase the budget for on-reserve welfare services. It could also lift the funding cap on education that all but ensures there will be no progress on the low number of aboriginal high school graduates. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169844">Let me remind the government that the House unanimously voted a year ago this month in support of a motion to provide equitable funding for all first nation schools, based on Shannen's Dream. These motions are not meant to be passed and then forgotten; they are marching orders for the government. It is a shame the government ignores these motions. One year later the country has become electrified with the grassroots campaign that is based on both the inaction of the government on pressing issues, like education, funding and unequal welfare services, and the incredible liberties it has taken with legislation that directly affects first nations, Inuit and Métis without proper consultation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169845">Will the government take action on the cycle of poverty that grips far too many of Canada's aboriginal communities and increase the budgets for welfare services in those communities?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

That is why our government is taking concrete steps to ensure that first nation children have the same opportunities as all Canadians. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169847">All children are protected by provincial and territorial child welfare legislation. Provincial and territorial governments can delegate authority for child and family services to first nation service providers on reserve and are responsible for ensuring that they comply with provincial and territorial legislation and standards.</ParaText><ParaText id="3169848">Over the last 20 years, provincial welfare authorities have delegated program delivery on reserve to a growing number of first nation child and family service agencies. Currently, there are 105 first nations with this authority. In areas where first nation child and family service agencies do not exist, the government funds services by provincial and territorial organizations or departments. Our government provides funding to support the implementation of these programs on reserve. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3169849">Since 2006, we have increased funding for child and family services by 25%. However, our government knows that money is not the solution. While progress has been made, it will take the continued and coordinated efforts of governments at all levels as well as first nations to make long-term progress. That is why we have launched prevention models working with provincial and first nation partners on a province-by-province basis. This new approach enhances the ability of child and family service providers to offer culturally appropriate services, such as kinship care, and to ensure that best practices and prevention are brought to reserves. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169850">The new approach was welcomed immediately by service providers in making programming choices for first nation children, youth and families on reserve. We will continue to work with our partners in the first nation community to ensure proved outcomes. </ParaText><ParaText id="3169851">I would remind the member that first nations want to have opportunities to improve their own lives. That is why we are creating a stronger economy with greater economic opportunity for all the people of our land to pursue their dreams, take responsibility for their lives and own their destinies.

Increasingly, I am speaking to young people in these communities who are asking why so little has happened. They see a government that saddles their communities with drinking water regulations and accounting procedures and interferes with the way those communities make decisions, but pays nothing more than lip service to education deficits, health crises and housing challenges.
