					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Moore (Fundy Royal)" id="2180119"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78963" Type="18">Mr. Rob Moore (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="758074">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to join in the debate on Bill C-2, the tackling violent crime act.</ParaText><ParaText id="758075">As the <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> noted when he spoke in reply to the Speech from the Throne, safe streets and secure communities are the Canadian way of life. This is what I would like to focus my remarks on today, how we are building a stronger, safer and better Canada, beginning with Bill <Document DbId="3076458" Type="3">C-2</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="758076">I have had many opportunities, as probably all members in the House have had, to talk with my constituents, parents, community leaders, police, lawyers, and many others about their concern with crime and what we should do about it.</ParaText><ParaText id="758077">What I have heard has likely been heard by all hon. members as they have travelled throughout their ridings and indeed across Canada. Canadians are clearly expecting their government to take concrete and effective action to tackle crime.</ParaText><ParaText id="758078">Unlike previous governments on this issue, the current government listens. We share these concerns and we have made tackling crime a key priority for our government. We have made it a key priority for our government because it is a key priority for Canadians, but there is so much more that needs to be done.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758079">We know what crime looks like in Canada. Crime statistics have been recorded since 1962 so we have 45 years of information. Statistics Canada reported last July that the overall national crime rate has decreased for the second year in a row. </ParaText><ParaText id="758080">We all want to see a lower crime rate. So this is the good news. But the national crime rate is an average and does not tell us about some of the more serious problems or localized problems.</ParaText><ParaText id="758081">The long term trends over the last few generations show us what we all know in the House, that crime has increased drastically. Since the 1970s, for example, the violent crime rate has increased 98%, but the national crime rate does not tell us what may be going on in individual communities. Community leaders, victims groups and law enforcement know their particular challenges, and we are listening to them.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758082">Many Canadians have lost confidence in the criminal justice system and question if it is doing enough to protect them. They know that violent crime is all too common. They dread hearing statistics like those released on October 17 by Statistics Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="758083">Those statistics tell us that 4 out of 10, or 40% of victims of violent crimes sustained injuries. They tell us that half of violent crimes occurred at private residences. They tell us that firearms were involved in 30% of homicides, 31% of attempted murders and 13% of robberies committed. They tell us that one out of every six victims of violent crimes was a youth aged 12 to 17 years old and children under 12 years of age account for 23% of victims of sexual assaults and 5% of victims of violent crimes.</ParaText><ParaText id="758084">Canadians are looking to the federal government to work with them to restore community safety. The government understands the need for leadership in criminal justice and this is what our tackling crime priority, and our commitment in this regard is all about. It is about reducing all crime and providing an effective criminal justice system. Our plan is ambitious, but Canadians can count on us to get it done. As they have seen on other issues, we have been able to get things done for all Canadians.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758085">In the last session of Parliament the government tabled 13 crime bills. This is proof of our commitment to address crime and safety issues in our communities. It is interesting to note that it was 13 crime bills as it was 13 years of Liberal governments that have left us with a revolving door justice system in which Canadians have lost faith, a justice system that Canadians feel puts the rights of criminals ahead of the rights of everyday, law-abiding Canadians. This is what our government is going to address.</ParaText><ParaText id="758086">Six of these crime bills, of the 13, received royal assent and are now the law or will soon become the law. For example, one of the government's first bills and first priorities was to curtail the use of conditional sentences or house arrest for serious violent crimes. </ParaText><ParaText id="758087">We all know the issue of house arrest. In all of our ridings we have heard cases where someone has committed a very serious, sometimes violent, crime and there is an expectation in the community that there will be a severe consequence for someone who commits a severe crime. All too often the community is outraged when it hears that criminals will be serving out their sentence from the comfort of their own home.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758088">Bill <Document DbId="2172003" Type="3">C-9</Document>, which received royal assent on May 31, 2007, and will be coming into force on December 1, 2007, makes it clear that conditional sentences or house arrest will not be an option for serious personal injury offences, terrorism offences, and organized crime offences where the maximum term of imprisonment is 10 years or more.</ParaText><ParaText id="758089">This change was a long time coming. It is well past due and Canadians will be better served by a justice system that does not allow, for these serious offences, criminals to serve a sentence in their own home. Canadians wanted this change.</ParaText><ParaText id="758090">Bill <Document DbId="2250003" Type="3">C-18</Document> strengthened the laws governing the national DNA data bank. This will facilitate police investigation of crimes. Bill <Document DbId="2250003" Type="3">C-18</Document> received royal assent on June 22, 2007. Some provisions are already in force and others will soon be proclaimed in force.</ParaText><ParaText id="758091">Bill <Document DbId="2277339" Type="3">C-19</Document> made Canada's streets safer by enacting new offences to specifically combat street racing. These new offences built upon existing offences, including dangerous driving and criminal negligence, and provide higher maximum penalties of incarceration for the most serious of street racing offences. </ParaText><ParaText id="758092">As well, mandatory driving prohibition will be imposed on those convicted of street racing. In the most serious cases involving repeat street racing offenders, a mandatory lifetime driving prohibition can now be imposed.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758093">We also took concrete steps to protect users of payday loans. Bill <Document DbId="2368473" Type="3">C-26</Document>, which received royal assent on May 3, 2007, makes it an offence to enter into an agreement or an arrangement to receive interest at a criminal rate or to receive payment of an interest at a criminal rate. The criminal rate of interest is defined as exceeding 60% per year.</ParaText><ParaText id="758094">We also took further measures to combat corruption. Bill <Document DbId="2776071" Type="3">C-48</Document> enacted Criminal Code amendments to enable Canada to ratify and implement the United Nations convention against corruption on October 2, 2007. By ratifying the convention, Canada has joined 92 other state parties committed to working with the international community to take preventative measures against corruption.</ParaText><ParaText id="758095">Our bill to stop film piracy or camcording, Bill <Document DbId="2981529" Type="3">C-59</Document>, received widespread support. It was quickly passed and received royal assent on June 22, 2007.</ParaText><ParaText id="758096">Unfortunately, none of our other important crime bills progressed to enactment before Parliament prorogued. That is why the tackling violent crime act reintroduces the provisions of the following bills that died on the order paper.</ParaText><ParaText id="758097">The bill imposing mandatory minimum penalties of imprisonment for firearms offences, Bill <Document DbId="2172019" Type="3">C-10</Document>, is included in Bill <Document DbId="3076458" Type="3">C-2</Document> as passed by the House of Commons. </ParaText><ParaText id="758098">Bill <Document DbId="2304794" Type="3">C-22</Document>, which increased the age of protection against adult sexual exploitation, has been included, as passed by the House of Commons. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758099">Bill <Document DbId="2510257" Type="3">C-32</Document>, addressing drug impaired driving and impaired driving in general, has been introduced as amended by the House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights and reported to the House of Commons.</ParaText><ParaText id="758100">Bill <Document DbId="2519653" Type="3">C-35</Document>, imposing a reverse onus for bail for firearms offences, has been included in this new bill, as passed by the House of Commons. This bill will make it tougher for those who have committed a firearms offence to received bail and be back out on the street.</ParaText><ParaText id="758101">Bill <Document DbId="2397807" Type="3">C-27</Document>, addressing dangerous and repeat violent offenders, as originally introduced, is included in this bill, but with some further amendments, which I will elaborate on shortly.</ParaText><ParaText id="758102">The tackling violent crime act respects the parliamentary process and includes the bills as amended by committee or as passed by the House of Commons, and in the same state that they were when Parliament was prorogued. As a result, these reforms are familiar, or should be familiar, to all members of this House, and so I would call on all hon. members to quickly pass the tackling violent crime act.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758103">Indeed, many hon. members have already stated that they support these reforms. There is therefore no need to further debate these reforms or for a prolonged study of the provisions that Parliament has already debated and committees have already scrutinized. It is time for us all to demonstrate our commitment to safeguarding Canadians and for safer communities, and to quickly move this bill forward.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp><ParaText id="758104">For those who need more convincing, I would like to reiterate that the tackling violent crime act addresses a range of serious issues that put Canadians at risk: gun crimes, impaired driving, sexual offences against children and dangerous offenders.</ParaText><ParaText id="758105">We know that Canadians expect their government to take action and to protect them from these crimes. To do so, we need the support of all hon. members, as well as Canadians, our partners in the provinces and the territories, and law enforcement and community groups.</ParaText><ParaText id="758106">Time does not permit me to address each of the equally important elements of Bill <Document DbId="3076458" Type="3">C-2</Document>. I know that other members will rise to speak to the reforms that are of most concern to them. I propose to highlight a few of the issues that have been raised repeatedly with me by my constituents, and I am sure by constituents in ridings held by all hon. members, in particular, about impaired driving, the age of consent and dangerous offenders.</ParaText><ParaText id="758107">Alcohol and drug impaired driving have devastating effects for victims, for families and for communities. Impaired drivers are responsible for thousands of fatalities and injuries each year, not to mention billions of dollars in property damage.</ParaText><ParaText id="758108">Once the tackling violent crime act is the law, impaired drivers will face tough punishment, no matter which intoxicant they choose, and police and prosecutors will have the tools that they need to deal with these offences.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758109">Although drug impaired driving has always been a crime, until recently, police have not had the same tools available to stop those who drive while impaired by drugs that they have to address alcohol impaired driving. Under this bill, they will.</ParaText><ParaText id="758110">The tackling violent crime act strengthens the ability of police, prosecutors and the courts to investigate, prosecute and sentence those who endanger the safety of other Canadians through alcohol or drug impaired driving. I know that all hon. members recognize the pressing need to ensure the safety of our streets, highways, communities and our schools. By giving police the tools they need to combat impaired driving, we are doing that.</ParaText><ParaText id="758111">These reforms were applauded by the stakeholders and supported in the House of Commons. I am sure every member of Parliament in the House has received correspondence urging them to support the bill. There should be no impediments to making progress on this part of the tackling violent crime act. </ParaText><ParaText id="758112">The act also reintroduces the reforms to raise the age at which young people can consent to sexual activity from 14 to 16 years of age. The bill takes away the ability, and let us be clear on what the bill does, of adult sexual predators to rely on claims that their young victims consented.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758113">Again, these reforms were welcomed by child advocates and supported in the House as part of former Bill <Document DbId="2304794" Type="3">C-22</Document>, so there is no need for further debate. We can move ahead.</ParaText><ParaText id="758114">It is worth spending a few moments to focus on the dangerous and high risk offender provisions of former Bill <Document DbId="2397807" Type="3">C-27</Document>. Some of these provisions have been modified and, therefore, hon. members may want to scrutinize these aspects more than the other reforms included in the tackling violent crime act.</ParaText><ParaText id="758115">The dangerous offender reforms in Bill <Document DbId="3076458" Type="3">C-2</Document> respond to the concerns highlighted in the debates and before the justice committee, and by provincial attorneys general. I am sure that all hon. members will agree that these modifications are welcomed.</ParaText><ParaText id="758116">As members will recall, former Bill <Document DbId="2397807" Type="3">C-27</Document> was tabled in the House last October. That bill included dramatic enhancements to the sentencing and management of the very worst of the worst, those offenders who repeatedly commit violent and sexual crimes and who require special attention, because it has become clear that the regular criminal sentencing regime simply cannot effectively manage the small but violent and dangerous group of offenders.</ParaText><ParaText id="758117">The tackling violent crime act includes all of the original amendments to the Criminal Code from the former Bill <Document DbId="2397807" Type="3">C-27</Document>, as well as two important changes which will go further in protecting Canadians from dangerous offenders.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758118">First, let me provide an overview of the provisions brought forward into the House under Bill <Document DbId="2397807" Type="3">C-27</Document>. It includes the requirement in dangerous offender hearings that an offender be presumed to meet the dangerous offender criteria upon a third conviction for a primary designated offence. In other words, an offence that is on the list of the 12 most violent or sexual offences that typically trigger dangerous offender designations.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp><ParaText id="758119">Second, the bill would also place a requirement on crown prosecutors to inform the court that they had fully considered whether to pursue a dangerous offender application. This is to prevent these applications from falling through the cracks. This would occur in cases where an offender had been convicted for a third time of a relatively serious sexual or violent offence.</ParaText><ParaText id="758120">The declaration is intended to ensure more consistent use of the dangerous offender sentence by the Crown in all jurisdictions. Although the Crown must indicate whether it has considered bringing a dangerous offender application, we are not dictating to it that it must do so. We are not attempting to arbitrarily fetter the discretion of the Crown or of the court. Rather, we are providing a way to make sure that the Crown turns its mind to the issue of a dangerous offender application.</ParaText><ParaText id="758121">Third, Bill <Document DbId="3076458" Type="3">C-2</Document> would also bring forward the very significant reforms to the section 810.1 and 810.2 peace bond provisions that enable any person to apply to a court to ask for stringent conditions to be imposed against individuals who are felt to pose a threat of sexual or violent offending in the community. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758122">We have all heard the horror stories from one end of the country to the other of someone who is known to be a threat to commit a sexual or violent offence against an innocent member of the community. There is often great frustration among Canadians at the perceived inability for government, for officials, for police, to act to protect the community from a subsequent violent or sexual offence.</ParaText><ParaText id="758123">Specifically, we are doubling the duration of peace bonds from one year to two years. We are also providing specific authority for the court to impose conditions regarding curfews, electronic monitoring, treatment requirements and other prohibitions as well as making it very clear that the court may impose any conditions it feels are necessary to ensure public safety.</ParaText><ParaText id="758124">Since the tabling of the former Bill <Document DbId="2397807" Type="3">C-27</Document> last October, provincial attorneys general have raised concerns about violent offenders who are found to be dangerous offenders, but are not receiving indeterminate sentences. This is due to a finding that they could be managed under the long term offender designation.</ParaText><ParaText id="758125">The long term offender sentencing option currently in the Criminal Code allows a court to sentence an individual to a regular sentence of imprisonment, but add up to 10 years of intensive community supervision to the sentence. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758126">Based on the interpretation of the lower courts of the 2003 decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Johnson, many individuals who fully meet the designation of a dangerous offender have nonetheless been given long term offender designation instead. The Crown has been unable to convince the sentencing court that the offenders could not be managed under the less severe sentence option.</ParaText><ParaText id="758127">The big concern is that some of these individuals may not in fact be suitable for community supervision sentences. Yet, until they commit another violent sentence, their status as a dangerous offender cannot be reviewed by a court. I should mention, and it should be obvious, until they commit another violent offence, then it is too late for the community, for innocent victims and for families.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758128">Given the concerns expressed since former Bill <Document DbId="2397807" Type="3">C-27</Document> was tabled, the government has been examining the scope of this problem and developing potential solutions. It is clear that a large proportion of the individuals who meet the dangerous offender criteria, but have been given a less severe sentence, have demonstrated that they simply refuse to cooperate. The majority eventually breach one or more of the conditions of their long term supervision order. This is a clear indicator that the original sentence was based on a flawed presumption that the offender was manageable. As such, there is a real need to revisit the original sentence in order to stop the reoffending right then and there before another tragedy occurs.</ParaText><ParaText id="758129">The tackling violent crime act addresses this problem and includes new provisions that were not included in the former bill. </ParaText><ParaText id="758130">First, the tackling violent crime act makes it clear that from now on if offenders meet the dangerous offender criteria, they will always be designated as a dangerous offender first, and that designation is for life. The court must then determine the appropriate sentence, either an indeterminate sentence or a determinate sentence, with or without the long term offender supervision order. Critical to this scheme is that from now on the court must impose an indeterminate sentence unless it is satisfied that the offenders can be managed under a less severe sentence.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758131">Second, in cases where dangerous offenders are able to satisfy the court that they can be managed under the lesser sentence and are subsequently charged and convicted with a breach of a long term supervision order, they can be brought back to the court for a new sentencing hearing. At the new hearing, dangerous offenders will have to satisfy the court once again that they can still be managed under the lesser sentence. If not, the indeterminate sentence must be imposed.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp><ParaText id="758132">The government believes that the impact of these new reforms will be significant. Because of the clarification to the sentencing provisions, fewer offenders will escape the dangerous offender designation. In addition, for the few offenders who are declared to be dangerous offenders, but given a long term offender sentence, they will know that if they do not abide by the term of their supervision orders once released, they will be returned to court for a new sentencing hearing and an indeterminate sentence will be the likely outcome.</ParaText><ParaText id="758133">It will not take a second sexual assault or a second violent offence to bring the offender back for a new dangerous offender sentence. This new provision would be available, for example, even if the violation were simply that the offender failed to return to his residence before curfew or consumed alcohol or drugs in violation of a long term offender supervision order.</ParaText><ParaText id="758134">Our government remains committed to ensuring that all Canadians live in safe and secure communities. The tackling violent crime act will protect Canadians. It is fulfilling our commitments to Canadians. The government is committed to taking action, acting on behalf of the safety of all Canadians. I urge all members to support the tackling violent crime act.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I know what he wishes for is what all Canadians wish for, a safe society. I will have a speech rebutting a lot of his technical points, but the question is this. As the <Affiliation DbId="78963" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice</Affiliation>, he heard much evidence, as we all did on the justice committee, about how to effect the legislation, the 13 bills with which we were presented.</ParaText><ParaText id="758137">I have a few very short questions.</ParaText><ParaText id="758138"> Why has the Conservative government not fulfilled its promise of 2,500 police officers? How can it put into place a thousand RCMP officers when the RCMP itself is a thousand persons behind in its recruitment drive? Is the drug recognition expert program funded?

We see this whether it is on the national defence side, or our intelligence organization CSIS, or the RCMP, which over the course of the previous government's mandate received drastic cuts in funding. We need only go to the annual reports and updates on government spending. It is all documented every year for all Canadians to read. Canadians can see that the funding for the RCMP was cut.</ParaText><ParaText id="758142">Our government was elected with a mandate to get tough on crime. Getting tough on crime is not only about passing legislation. It is about bringing in preventive measures. It is about supporting communities. It is about supporting families. It is about providing funding for our police and for our provinces.</ParaText><ParaText id="758143">Our government has made a commitment for additional RCMP officers and for additional municipal police forces. We will keep that commitment. That is what this government does. It keeps the commitments it made to Canadians. Canadians know that. It is a refreshing change.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758144">I can assure the hon. member that whether it is the DNA data bank, which is a valuable tool, or the drug recognition experts who will play such a vital role when the tackling violent crime act is passed, or our police forces, RCMP or municipal, our government is committed to providing the support. We are also committed to passing legislation that will protect Canadians from violent criminals. That is what Canadians asked us to do, and that is exactly what we are doing.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Let us be honest and admit that that is just what it was. The numbers themselves are shocking.</ParaText><ParaText id="758146">The opposition was accused of obstructing justice bills. But of the 12 bills that were originally introduced by the Conservative government, six have already received royal assent, four had made it through all stages in the House and were ready to be adopted by the Senate, and only two were still being debated in the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="758147">It could even be said that if the Conservative government had not decided to prorogue Parliament, most of these bills would probably have been adopted and received royal assent. By proroguing the House to deliver a completely insipid Speech from the Throne, the government itself killed the bills it is reintroducing today, saying that it does not want the opposition to obstruct them. In fact, it was the one that delayed the Parliamentary process.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758148">Would the parliamentary secretary not admit that this is all just playing to the media?

The only revolving door is the justice minister and officials in the Conservative Party going in and out of press conferences announcing and reannouncing the same bills on which they pulled the plug.</ParaText><ParaText id="758167">With respect to Bill C-2, I have reviewed all the material. I sat in on all the committee hearings. What I have recently discovered, through obtaining a bill briefing, is a note from the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> about Bill C-2, in that it regurgitates all the bills we dealt with in the last Parliament. The message from the Prime Minister is that he is sorry that he pulled the plug on Parliament and flushed all the good work of the justice committee down the drain. </ParaText><ParaText id="758168">That is what happened. All these bills were well on their way. They were going through the due process of Parliament, which followed the rules of parliaments before, and they were on the way to being in effect.</ParaText><ParaText id="758169">The reason we are here today is that the Prime Minister prorogued Parliament and those bills were killed in their tracks. It is not true that perhaps that is why the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> prorogued Parliament but I think it is. In fact, I think that is why we have a new session.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758170">I may be new and I may be in the back row but I read the papers and I know what is going on. Parliament was prorogued and all legislation was stopped in its tracks.</ParaText><ParaText id="758171">What is important to remind ourselves, and the Canadian public will want to know, is that there were 13 bills in the justice dossier and 7 of them were passed and are now the law of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="758172">As a member of the justice committee, I would expect all parties to tell all members of the justice committee that it was a job well done, that seven out of thirteen justice bills that affect the citizens of Canada are now law. Five of those bills are currently the subject of Bill <Document DbId="3076458" Type="3">C-2</Document>, which I will turn to, and one, mysteriously, of the thirteen bills, the criminal procedure act, which all parties agreed to unanimously, was a creature of a previous Parliament and which all prosecutors are waiting intently for. These prosecutors are the people who are on the front lines, as well as the police officers, in the criminal justice system. I suppose they are wondering why, despite the offer to fast track the bill by this party and despite the unanimous support by the justice committee, Bill <Document DbId="2304866" Type="3">C-23</Document> has not been moved up. Perhaps in the government's haste and the revolving door of the press circle and the press club, it forgot to bring along an important bill.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758173">Overall, the 13 bills, the 7 passed and the 1 dropped by an incompetent justice minister and the parliamentary secretary for forgetting that, and the 5 we are about to discuss, all of these bills need to be enforced. Each police officer, prosecutor, probation officer and corrections official, all those people in the system need to know that if there are 13 new laws, 12 because 1 was dropped by the incompetent ministry, but if there are 12 new bills we need to know we have the resources to put them into effect.</ParaText><ParaText id="758174">It is urgent for the public to know that despite a promise by the government, the law and order government, the tough on crime government, it is toothless without following up on the promise of 2,500 new police officers and the false promise in the Speech from the Throne for 1,000 new RCMP officers when the RCMP cannot recruit 1,000 officers. It is behind in its recruitment. It is a meaningless, toothless promise to the people of Canada but, even worse, it takes away the hope of the Canadian Police Association, the Canadian Association of Police Chiefs, the prosecutors and the probation officers, all the people who must put into effect, on a daily basis, the laws of the justice system.</ParaText>

We support our justice system. We support our judges, our prosecutors, and all of the police officers who are responsible for protecting Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="758176">Over the past 18 months, the Liberal Party has undertaken a thorough review of the legislation pertaining to crime while the Conservatives have been busy playing political games. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> put an end to this Parliament's activities and committee work, thereby throwing out the amendments that this bill sought to make to five acts. It is his fault that these five acts have not yet been amended.</ParaText><ParaText id="758177">We on this side of the House have faith in our justice system and are convinced that it will keep the peace in our communities.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="758178">I say that because it should be a non-partisan issue that we all believe in a safe community. We are all here as parliamentarians, surely, to ensure that we have a safe community. We may differ on the avenue to get there, but how much did we, the Liberal Party of Canada and its members on the justice committee, really differ from the plan of the Conservative Party in general and, more importantly, in the organic process which is called the development of criminal law through amendments to the Criminal Code?</ParaText><ParaText id="758179"> I say to the House and to the public: not much.</ParaText><ParaText id="758180">There were 13 bills proposed. Seven passed and there are five in Bill <Document DbId="3076458" Type="3">C-2</Document> that we are substantially in agreement on because they would have been law by now had Parliament not been prorogued, and I must say for the record that there is one that has been dropped by the government and that we are also in favour of. </ParaText><ParaText id="758181">So how is it that we, in trying to keep the community safe, are against the elements in Bill <Document DbId="3076458" Type="3">C-2</Document> and the elements in these bills? I will repeat them: Bill <Document DbId="2172003" Type="3">C-9</Document>, on conditional sentences; Bill <Document DbId="2250003" Type="3">C-18</Document>, on DNA identification; Bill <Document DbId="2277339" Type="3">C-19</Document>, on street racing; Bill <Document DbId="2374081" Type="3">C-25</Document>, on proceeds of crime; Bill <Document DbId="2368473" Type="3">C-26</Document>, on criminal rate of interest; and just to add two others that were not part of Bill C-2, Bill <Document DbId="2776071" Type="3">C-48</Document>, on the implementation of a UN convention against corruption, and Bill <Document DbId="2981529" Type="3">C-59</Document>, on the unauthorized recording of a movie. These have all been supported.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758182">But there is more. I hear members on the opposite side talk about 13 years of inaction with respect to criminal justice and I think the Canadian public would be interested to know that these laws, while continuing on the evolution of our criminal law and making our community safer, are but part of the Criminal Code of Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="758183">On the Criminal Code of Canada, I might say this in a moment of non-partisanship and to congratulate a Conservative politician, albeit a dead one.When Prime Minister John Thompson, a Conservative prime minister, was minister of justice he essentially created and adapted the criminal law of Canada into a code that we would follow in this country. I want to get credit for giving plaudits to a Conservative in this place.</ParaText><ParaText id="758184">A principal part of the Criminal Code of Canada, which we have been talking about since I have been in Parliament, is sentencing. What is sentencing? The purpose and principles of sentencing are set out in section 718. I hear very often in this place and at the revolving door of the press conference centre for the Conservative Party of Canada that there is but one principle in sentencing, that is, to put the bad guys away.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758185"> I know this is a novel concept for those who are directing the Conservative justice agenda, but why do we not refer to what the law says about the purpose and principles of sentencing? They are set out in section 718. I am not going to read this word for word because it tends to be bogged down in particularness and assuredness and literal things that, again, the Conservative justice team really knows nothing about, having adopted and written such sloppy legislation that it had to be sent to committee to be fixed.</ParaText><ParaText id="758186">However, in general, there are six important factors or principles in sentencing. It is the reason we have sentences for people who have committed crimes. One principle is to denounce unlawful conduct. That is the one I hear about most often from the Conservative justice team. That is a valid principle, but it is one of six. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758187">What are the others? One is to deter the offender from doing it again. That is another one I hear a lot about. The point over here is that those two of the six are very important. We are not shirking the importance of those. The law does not say that any one is more important than the other. It is a guidepost to judges who make our law pursuant to what they read here. It is a guidepost to say that we will denounce unlawful conduct. Yes, we will, by bringing in this sentence. We will deter the person or any person in the public from doing it again. They are two very important objectives.</ParaText><ParaText id="758188">However, that is where the Conservative justice team stops most of the time. The Conservatives forget that they must separate offenders from society when necessary and that they must assist in rehabilitating offenders. This is not to mean that the criminal gets more justice than the victim. What it means is that if there is a chance to rehabilitate an offender before that offender is reintegrated into society, or after, we ought to take that chance. Society is not safer, and let us remember that this safety is the principal goal of all parliamentarians here, by sending a more dangerous person back into the community after his or her sentence is served. It is a very important principle, as important as deterrence and as important as denouncing unlawful conduct.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="45">(1045)</Timestamp><ParaText id="758189">The fifth aspect is to provide reparations for harm done to victims. That is very key. I will get into speaking about Bill <Document DbId="2172003" Type="3">C-9</Document>, which was a failed bill and flawed until it was amended at committee by all parties. One of the key aspects of Bill C-9 was to amend it to allow some white collar criminals, for lack of a better term, who had done a very denunciatory offence, which should be deterred, such as acts of stealing money through a breach of trust from someone, say, the option of a conditional sentence. It was to allow them to make reparations and restitution during the term of their sentence when it might mean the difference between an aged person with a stolen RRSP account getting that money back or not.</ParaText><ParaText id="758190"> It gave back discretion to the judge, which he or she had in the first place, and it was a very necessary amendment to a flawed and hasty bill to make sure that this principle of sentencing, that is, to provide reparation for harm done to victims, was put in place. It was made better law by the intervention of the committee.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758191">The final principle is to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, an acknowledgement of the harm done to victims and to the community. What that is about is making sure that these offenders are not so divorced from the community in which they live, so that they know when they have done wrong that they have a responsibility to that community to be remorseful, to make amends and, I think very importantly, to reintegrate into that community if possible. We should never forget that.</ParaText><ParaText id="758192">The overall principle, and it is written as the fundamental principle in section 718.1 of the code, is that of the proportionality, of the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. This is a very important principle, which judges rely on all the time.</ParaText><ParaText id="758193">I hear members speak about 13 years of Liberal inactivity. Actually I was not here for any of those 13 years. I was on the outside looking at all of the criminal justice bills that had been brought in during that time. I remember that it was a Liberal minister of justice who brought in the whole concept of mandatory minimums, which at the revolving door of the Conservatives' press circle was as if it was invented by them. I wonder if they invented the laws of gravity and found the North American continent. I suspect not, Mr. Speaker, and I do not suppose you could answer objectively if they say they have somewhere else, but I am not sure that they would not stand here and say that they have. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758194">They did not invent mandatory minimums. The other sentencing principles in section 718.2 were brought in, in successive Liberal governments, by amendments in 1995, 1997, 2000, 2001 and 2005. All of those amendments in section 718.2 were brought in to recognize the changing nature of our society and to allow judges for the first time in the history of the Criminal Code to take into account these factors when sentencing, either in increasing or in decreasing the sentences, and I am very proud of that. </ParaText><ParaText id="758195">These factors include evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate. It is the first time that it was codified that a judge should take into account hate crimes when sentencing. For any crimes committed based on someone's ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation and other factors, is it not correct, right and fair in this society that those sentences were brought in and that judges should be told to take into account those factors in section 718.2, or whether the violence was against a spouse or common law partner?</ParaText><ParaText id="758196"> Is it not important, for instance, that a judge be given that discretion to increase a sentence if the crime was against a spouse or a common law partner, or if the crime was done to a person of tender years under the age of 18? Is it not important that this be taken into account?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758197">Is it not important, as it says in subparagraph 718.2(a)(iii), whether or not the person who committed the crime “abused a position of trust or authority”, or also whether the person was a member of a criminal organization, or that the offence was a terrorism offence?</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp><ParaText id="758198">All of these factors were in judges' hands before 2005. These were not invented by the Newtons over there in the last 18 months. They were there, it was Liberal legislation, and I presume it had all party support because it makes such sense. </ParaText><ParaText id="758199">Finally, in the principles of sentencing categories, paragraph 718.2(e) has the all important factor of recognizing that if an offender is of aboriginal origin or from a first nations community special circumstances should be put in place. We found during much of the deliberation at committee that this sentencing principle was often ignored.</ParaText><ParaText id="758200"> I look at the amendments in place with respect to Bill <Document DbId="2172019" Type="3">C-10</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="2172003" Type="3">C-9</Document>. It is a particular affront to this established sentencing principle, and it seems to have been completely forgotten by the Conservative government, that these two important sections of the code had existed before the Conservative government took place and certainly will exist when it moves on into the sunset.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758201">About the laws in Bill <Document DbId="3076458" Type="3">C-2</Document> and why it is so easy on this side for us to say we support the bill, it is important to remember that we on this side, and the members of the justice committee from the New Democratic Party and the Bloc Québécois will vouch for this, and the members of the justice committee had made Bill <Document DbId="2172019" Type="3">C-10</Document> and the mandatory minimum aspect a better bill when it left committee. Arrogantly, and without respect for the work of the all party committee, the Conservative justice team, coming yet again from the revolving door of the press club, suggested that it would put in at report stage the entire bill as it was before.</ParaText><ParaText id="758202">However, over the summer I think the Conservatives had blueberry festivals and strawberry festivals and must have eaten some humble pie at some festival, as they decided that they would accept the amendments as they came from the committee, reintroducing Bill <Document DbId="3076458" Type="3">C-2</Document> with the Bill <Document DbId="2172019" Type="3">C-10</Document> amendments to make our community a better place and enlarge upon the mandatory minimums that were already in place under the Liberal justice program before the Conservatives took office.</ParaText><ParaText id="758203">The other bill that needs clarification on why it is an acceptable bill now, and why it was never acceptable when the amateur Conservative justice team brought the topic up before, is Bill <Document DbId="2304794" Type="3">C-22</Document>, the age of consent bill. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758204">I have heard well-meaning, honest and forthright members of the House, such as the member for <Affiliation DbId="78373" Type="2">Wild Rose</Affiliation>, say that he and his colleagues could never get an age of consent or age of protection bill through the Commons. I was disturbed by that. I asked why we would not protect our young persons. Why would we not get in line with many of the communities around the world which recognize that consent may not be freely given by a 14 year old when the world has become smaller and the age of the predator is upon us?</ParaText><ParaText id="758205">I looked into it. There were two very fundamental flaws with all bills that were presented as part of a justice package by an opposition entitled the Conservative opposition. They are as follows. </ParaText><ParaText id="758206">There was absolutely no close in age exemption. This bill, Bill <Document DbId="2304794" Type="3">C-22</Document>, contains a close in age exemption, making it flexible enough to recognize that not every relationship that is separated by a number of years is a relationship between an innocent young child and a sexual predator.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758207">Finally, as I wrap up, age of consent as presented previously would have criminalized normal adolescent sexual activity which, whether the Conservatives like it or not, is out there, and 14 year olds and 15 year olds having relations are protected by this. It does prevent sexual predators from preying on the young. It is good legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="758208">In summary, the five bills in Bill <Document DbId="3076458" Type="3">C-2</Document> are good law because the committee made them so. I encourage the Conservative justice team, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and all Conservatives out there to watch what they write, to watch what they present to Parliament, and to not keep going through that revolving door called the press circle to give press releases without having done their homework to ensure that they are passing good laws which will make Canada safer.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I have indeed great respect for his comments. In fact, when he comments that prorogation is a privilege, that it is up to a government leader to take such a decision and that this has been used in the past by Liberal prime ministers, I take it that perhaps he approves of it and feels that the current <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was certainly within his rights and did the right thing by proroguing Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="758505">The comment in my speech, if it was misconstrued by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78339" Type="2">Edmonton—Sherwood Park</Affiliation>, was that by proroguing Parliament, these bills were killed in their tracks.

I took the opportunity to go through the list of bills that have been dealt with in one form or another.</ParaText><ParaText id="758511">The list was quite lengthy, starting with Bill <Document DbId="2172003" Type="3">C-9</Document>, which was a bill on conditional sentencing. That went through both Houses and has royal assent. There was one on the Judges Act, Bill <Document DbId="2222191" Type="3">C-17</Document>, and it also went through all stages. Another one relating to DNA identification went through all stages. As for Bill <Document DbId="2277339" Type="3">C-19</Document> on street racing, a particularly emotional point for the Conservative Party, we got that one through. There was one on criminal interest rates, Bill <Document DbId="2368473" Type="3">C-26</Document>, and it got through. There was one, Bill <Document DbId="2776071" Type="3">C-48</Document>, which dealt with international crime syndicates and the need to fight corruption at that level, coming out of the UN, and it got through. The next one, dealing with the illegal recording of movies, went very quickly through the House with all parties cooperating. It never even went to committee.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758512">In addition to that, we have had Bill <Document DbId="2304794" Type="3">C-22</Document>, which actually is part of Bill <Document DbId="3076458" Type="3">C-2</Document>, the bill that is before us now, passed at second reading in the Senate. It went through the House all the way to the Senate. We have had Bill <Document DbId="2172019" Type="3">C-10</Document>, an important bill on mandatory minimums, go through this House and into the Senate, where it was at first reading. </ParaText><ParaText id="758513">Similarly, Bill <Document DbId="2304866" Type="3">C-23</Document> went through this House and got to the Senate, but it is not part of this bill. I am not sure if the government is going to bring that one back or not. On Bill <Document DbId="2519653" Type="3">C-35</Document>, which was the bill dealing with bail reviews involving alleged gun crimes and the reverse onus being placed, again, it got through all the work in this House and went to the Senate.</ParaText><ParaText id="758514">The final bill with regard to work that we had done and which was almost through this House was the bill dealing with impaired driving. That had cleared the committee and was coming back to the House. It would have been back in the House if we had not prorogued in the middle part of September.</ParaText><ParaText id="758515"> These are all the bills we have had from the government. The final bill was still in committee and we had just started on it. We had three or four meetings taking witnesses on that bill, which deals with dangerous offenders and amendments to recognizance in the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758516">In addition, there were at least four to six private members' bills, all of them coming from the Conservative Party interestingly enough, which we dealt with and passed or dealt with in some fashion. One had to be withdrawn. We dealt with those as well. </ParaText><ParaText id="758517">All of that work was being done at the justice committee, with the exception, and this is really interesting, of two bills that went to special legislative committees. Because the justice committee's workload was so great, we moved them into special committees. However, we worked on those bills and got them through. </ParaText><ParaText id="758518">All of that is work we have done in a little over 18 months, yet in spite of that, there are two things the government does. It constantly complains about the length of time it takes, in regard to which the Conservatives could have done much better by originally having omnibus bills. I have said that in the House to the point where I am almost sick of hearing it myself, and I am sure everyone else in the House is, but it is the way they should have conducted themselves. Of course, though, because of their political agenda of wanting to highlight each one of these bills, they did not put them together. They finally came to their senses and realized that it is a way of moving bills through the House more rapidly.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758519">However, we did all of that work, and now what we are hearing, which is the second point I want to make about the government, is that the delay is the fault of the opposition. That is absolutely false.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp><ParaText id="758520">One can see from the length of the list of bills we have had to deal with, plus the private members' bills, plus working on two legislative committees in addition to all the work that we have done at justice, that nobody in the opposition has done any delaying. The delay with regard to the five bills that are incorporated now into Bill <Document DbId="3076458" Type="3">C-2</Document> is entirely at the feet of the government. It prorogued and that cost us a month.</ParaText><ParaText id="758521"> It is interesting to note what could have happened in that one month's time. It is my opinion that all three of the bills that were in the Senate would have been through and ready for royal assent, which again is in the hands of the government. If the government had conducted itself with any kind of efficiency, those bills probably would be law today.</ParaText><ParaText id="758522">The fourth bill, the one dealing with impaired driving, which again is part of Bill <Document DbId="3076458" Type="3">C-2</Document>, would have come to the House in the middle part of September when we came back. There was not a great deal of debate, and although I and my party have some reservations about it, we in fact would support it. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758523">The bill would have had some debate in the House at report stage and third reading, but it would have been through the House and at least at first reading in the Senate now, perhaps at second reading. It is not beyond the pale to think that the bill also would have cleared the Senate and would have been ready for royal assent.</ParaText><ParaText id="758524">This bill bothers me. Of all the ones we have, this one bothers me the most because of the conduct of the government in dealing with the individuals, including the police officers and police associations, who lobbied really heavily to get this legislation, and in particular the families and supporters of MADD, Mothers Against Drunk Driving. It bothers me that the government would have misused the loyalty and the support that those groups had given to the bill by leading them to believe that somehow it was the opposition that was holding it up, when in fact it was prorogation. Now there is this tactic of combining that bill with the other bills to actually slow down its passage. Otherwise there is a reasonably good chance it would have been law by now, and if not, it would have been in its final stages at the Senate and it certainly would have been law by the end of the year.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758525">That is much less likely to happen now. It is more likely that this bill will not get final approval and royal assent until well into the spring, no matter what the government tries to do. Quite frankly we will do whatever we can to be cooperative in moving these bills forward.</ParaText><ParaText id="758526">Our party was quite prepared to have all four of those bills that I have mentioned which form 80% of Bill <Document DbId="3076458" Type="3">C-2</Document> back at their original stages, again so they would be law or on the verge of becoming law, that is, receiving royal assent today, as opposed to what is likely to happen now. It is going to be into the new year and maybe well into the spring before these bills become law, assuming of course that the government does not collapse and there is an election, which is another problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="758527">The government has delayed it, and in addition, it has clearly pushed it back at least until the new year, with the real possibility of an election intervening and a number of these provisions never seeing the light of day until after the election, when we would come back and start the process all over again.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758528">That is reprehensible conduct on the part of the government. The only reason the Conservatives are doing it is so they can stand up in public and say, “We are tough on crime”. They do the macho thing. They beat their chests. They do the King Kong thing as if they are coming out of a jungle. The reality is that the delay is all at their feet.</ParaText><ParaText id="758529"> I am really angry when I think of all the work that so many groups have done, the victims of crime in particular, and now are being misused by the government in such a way.</ParaText><ParaText id="758530">I am not going to take up much more time but I do want to address the final bill that was at committee. Former Bill <Document DbId="2397807" Type="3">C-27</Document> is now part of Bill <Document DbId="3076458" Type="3">C-2</Document>. It deals with two amendments to the Criminal Code. One would be on the provisions relating to dangerous offenders and the other is with regard to recognizance.</ParaText><ParaText id="758531">With regard to recognizance, I think I can safely say that all the opposition parties are in support of those provisions. They give additional authority to our judiciary to deal with people who are out in the community on their own recognizance, but we can put additional conditions on them.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp><ParaText id="758532">The bill provides for things such as requiring them to wear a monitoring device. There is a number of other provisions that would substantially improve security in our communities regarding people who have now been released from charges and who have already served their time. It is a substantial step forward and one that has been needed. </ParaText><ParaText id="758533">I have said this in the House before, that when I started practising law back in the early 1970s we needed it at that time. Successive governments have tended to shy away from it. Our judiciary has attempted on a number of occasions to introduce these types of control devices, if I could put it that way, in terms of sentencing or conditions imposed on people and it has consistently lost in our courts of appeal. It required legislative intervention. The provision is in this bill and we need to pass that and get it into play so our judges can do a better job of helping protect Canadians, which they want to do.</ParaText><ParaText id="758534">The other part in this provision, the old Bill <Document DbId="2397807" Type="3">C-27</Document> now part of Bill <Document DbId="3076458" Type="3">C-2</Document>, is with regard to dangerous offenders. We have significant problems with this. Originally when the bill came before the House as Bill C-27, all three opposition parties indicated that on principle they had to vote against it because it has a provision of reverse onus with regard to the dangerous offender.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758535">All of us believe that that part of the bill would suffer a charter challenge that would be successful in striking it down. What I do not think the government has ever understood is that not only would it be struck down, but perhaps the whole dangerous offender section would be struck down. Just as we saw with the security certificates where the Supreme Court said that if it could not be fixed, they were all going down, the same type of thing could happen in a ruling on dangerous offenders. The government has never understood that.</ParaText><ParaText id="758536">Ultimately, the opposition parties decided that there were perhaps ways of amending this in committee to improve the use of the dangerous offender section, because we know we need to do that, and at the same time make sure that the section was not jeopardized by a successful charter challenge at some point in the future.</ParaText><ParaText id="758537">We were working on that when we ended in June. We fully expected that was one of the bills for the special legislative committee and that we would be back and working on it in September, that we would complete the witness testimony and improve the bill by way of amendment and if not, then I suppose we would have been faced with a conundrum of whether we could support it or not. That is where we are at this point.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758538">That bill needs significant work in order to be sure that we do not lose the entire dangerous offender section of the Criminal Code. We will be doing that work as soon as we can get the committee up and running again and the bill into the committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="758539">It is very clear that the government, and I do not say this about the opposition parties, is prepared to play politics with public safety. The Conservatives want to be seen as the champions and they are prepared to take these kinds of manoeuvres of delaying these bills by incorporating them all into Bill <Document DbId="3076458" Type="3">C-2</Document> so that they can do that. They want to stand up in the House and in the media and out on the hustings and say “we are the champions of it”, when in fact the truth is just the opposite. They were guilty. They are guilty of delay. The opposition parties are not.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Some of those original pieces of legislation sat on the order paper for a long time after they were first introduced.</ParaText><ParaText id="758544">The justice committee of this House is a very effective way of improving legislation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758545">A lot of the bills that were introduced as part of the original agenda were actually researched and widely consulted on under the former Liberal government.

Now we are seeing bills where there has been less consultation and preparation. </ParaText><ParaText id="758546"> I agree with the member that most of these bills are starting over in the House when they could have started at the stage where they left off before prorogation, in the Senate, but we are now dealing with this as it is.</ParaText><ParaText id="758547"> I want to hear the member's opinion on another bill, the street racing bill. In fact when I was justice critic, all the parties, including all the opposition parties, agreed to fast-track that bill because we wanted to see it rapidly in place. That fast-track offer was also put in place with respect to the age of consent bill.

The order in which bills are brought forward is entirely in the hands of the government, and there is nothing the opposition parties can do in that regard. I sometimes think that is a mistake in our system. On the basis of democracy and in a minority government situation, that rule should not be there. Opposition parties should have more control over what comes before the House, but this is not the case. The government completely controls this.</ParaText><ParaText id="758550">The member is right in terms of bills sitting on the order paper, and I will use Bill <Document DbId="2397807" Type="3">C-27</Document>, the dangerous offender bill, as an example. It sat on the order paper for almost six months. The bill was introduced in the House in the fall of 2006 and did not get to a vote for second reading and go to committee until well into the spring of 2007. For a good six months, it just sat on the order paper. That is a good example of how backlogged the justice committee was at that point.</ParaText><ParaText id="758551"> As I mentioned in my opening comments, a more efficient approach would have moved the bills along much faster. Let me just emphasize that point and explain what happens. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758552">When bills get to justice committee, there is a tendency to call the same witnesses on specific points. I have been saying in the House that the bills should have been bunched together. The government should have done that originally. It cannot be done now because these bills would be delayed again. </ParaText><ParaText id="758553">The Canadian Bar Association was forced to appear before the justice committee eight or ten times. Representatives could probably have come once or maybe twice, spoken on all the points and given us their input. </ParaText><ParaText id="758554">This goes back to consultation in terms of the member's question. The Conservative government has refused to consult with a number of groups because I think it sees them as ideologically unfriendly. Conservatives talk to members of police associations, but do they talk Canadian Bar Association? Maybe some. Do they talk to criminal defence lawyers, who have some significant input to provide on these bills? Hardly at all. </ParaText><ParaText id="758555">I could go down the list of some of the groups that deal with people who have been charged and convicted of crimes. For women, there is the Elizabeth Fry Society. For men, there is John Howard Society. The government does not talk too much to these people.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758556">That delays the process at committee. These groups come forward at committee to tell us what they think the problems are with the legislation, and that is the first time we hear about it. Perhaps it could have been taken care of by consultation before it ever arrived at committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="758557">I have already mentioned the issue of street car racing. All parties in the House supported that and we put it through as quickly as we could.</ParaText><ParaText id="758558">With respect to the age of consent legislation, I fought with the former Conservative <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">justice minister</Affiliation>, my colleague from Manitoba, and convinced him that we should put it in. We tried to put it into the child pornography bill in 2005. It resurrected itself in the age of consent bill, Bill <Document DbId="2304794" Type="3">C-22</Document>, that finally came before the House. The bill went all the way to the Senate.

I question that.</ParaText><ParaText id="758561"> If a person comes up to me, points a gun at me, pulls the trigger and misses, and thankfully, to me he is a dangerous guy. I do not want to live next door to a guy like that. I would move away if he did not. That is just the first time.</ParaText><ParaText id="758562">The legislation being proposed has a person doing things of that nature, attacking women and children. He does it, not once, not twice, but three times. In each instance, we, the people, through the Crown, have already shown that he is dangerous because he was charged and convicted three times.</ParaText><ParaText id="758563">To me, the reverse onus is almost a misnomer here. We should not say that. Rather we should say that the person has proven to us and courts have convicted him of these charges three time. It is now just an automatic, he is a dangerous offender and ought to be put away for a long time. To me, that is a given. </ParaText>

On several occasions the members on the government side have unfortunately taken some liberties with the truth. They have suggested that, in this Parliament, the opposition parties—the official opposition, the Bloc Québécois and the NDP—did not cooperate, that they acted like spoilsports and had unduly and excessively delayed passage of the justice bills. We need to set the record straight. This presentation of the facts is false, dishonest and, at the very least, misleading.</ParaText><ParaText id="758573">Since coming into power in January 2006, the Conservative government has tabled 12 justice bills. They were studied by the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights and the legislative committee and six of them have received royal assent. Therefore, since the government came into office in January 2006, six bills have been adopted and received royal assent.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758574">I will mention them quickly, for information purposes: Bill <Document DbId="2172003" Type="3">C-9</Document>, on conditional sentencing; Bill <Document DbId="2222191" Type="3">C-17</Document>, on the salaries of judges; Bill <Document DbId="2250003" Type="3">C-18</Document>, on the DNA data bank; Bill <Document DbId="2277339" Type="3">C-19</Document>, which was meant as a tribute to a Conservative member who unfortunately passed away, and which makes street racing a new offence under the Criminal Code; the fifth bill, namely Bill <Document DbId="2776071" Type="3">C-48</Document>, on the United Nations Convention against Corruption and on international crime, was fast-tracked and supported by all opposition parties and the government; finally, the sixth one, is Bill <Document DbId="2981529" Type="3">C-59</Document>, creating a new offence, under the Criminal Code, for the unauthorized recording of a movie in a movie theatre. That legislation was quickly passed, at the request of the Bloc Québécois, which had enlisted the support of the official opposition and of the NDP.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758575">Again, of the 12 bills introduced by the government, six received royal assent. That left six, with four of them being in the Senate. That was the case for Bill <Document DbId="2172019" Type="3">C-10</Document>, on minimum penalties for offences involving firearms, and for Bill <Document DbId="2304794" Type="3">C-22</Document>, on the age of protection. The Conservatives proposed to raise the age of protection from 14 to 16 years. As mentioned earlier, opposition parties requested that a close in age provision be included, to provide for a difference of five or two years, depending on the age being considered.</ParaText><ParaText id="758576">As I just mentioned, Bill <Document DbId="2172019" Type="3">C-10</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="2304794" Type="3">C-22</Document> were before the Senate. Bill <Document DbId="2304866" Type="3">C-23</Document>, which is a rather technical bill on the language used during a trial before a jury, was also before the Senate, as was Bill <Document DbId="2519653" Type="3">C-35</Document>, dealing with the reverse onus, at the pre-trial hearing, for a number of very serious offences. The committee was told that this was already the usual practice, and that a justice of the peace or a superior court judge very rarely grants bail at the pre-trial hearing, when the individual is accused of murder, assault or sexual assault. This was already an established practice.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758577">In summary, six bills have been passed and have received royal assent, and four had already gone through third reading in the House of Commons and were in the Senate. This left us with two bills: the dangerous offenders bill, Bill <Document DbId="2397807" Type="3">C-27</Document>, which I will address later, and Bill <Document DbId="2510257" Type="3">C-32</Document> dealing with impaired driving.</ParaText><ParaText id="758578">Could the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Conservative team be asked to be a little more relaxed and show a more nuanced and respectful attitude toward the opposition?</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp><ParaText id="758579">We are going to do our job. In the past, we have given the government our cooperation when that was necessary, but we have introduced amendments because, unfortunately, an entire segment of the Conservative caucus has no idea of nuances. I will give examples. Had Bill <Document DbId="2510257" Type="3">C-32</Document> been passed as written, without amendments, anyone driving his or her own car with a passenger on board who was in possession of a small amount of marijuana could have faced prosecution or arrest. </ParaText><ParaText id="758580">Was that the purpose of the legislation? This bill was intended to address a public safety issue, recognizing that no one should be operating a vehicle on public roadways while under the influence of drugs, and to allow for drivers to be subjected to standardized tests known as standardized field sobriety tests. The intention certainly was not to pass legislation to target drivers carrying drugs without their knowledge. That could happen. I could give three people a ride to my cottage without knowing that one of them has marijuana in his or her pocket. This would have made me liable to prosecution.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758581">This is the sort of excess the Conservatives are guilty of, when we are talking about a bill, a motivation, and an intent that are utterly defensible in terms of public policy. But when the Conservatives are left to their own devices, when they are ruled by that extreme wing of their caucus and blinded by the idea of law and order, they come up with bills that have to be amended.</ParaText><ParaText id="758582">Conditional sentencing has been mentioned. When we began looking at Bill <Document DbId="2172003" Type="3">C-9</Document>, the first justice bill the Conservatives introduced—the member for <Affiliation DbId="78658" Type="2">London West</Affiliation> will recall—we were told that conditional sentences represented only 5% of sentences.</ParaText><ParaText id="758583">If you look at all the sentences handed down in all the courts in Canada in recent years for which records have been kept, you see that conditional sentences, which allow offenders to serve their sentence in the community under supervision, represented only 5% of sentences.</ParaText><ParaText id="758584">If we had adopted the bill as introduced by the Conservatives, all offences punishable by more than two years in prison might have been excluded from this tool judges have for determining how a sentence can be served in the community.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758585">I repeat that I am extremely disappointed with the attitude of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, who asks the opposition to vote for bills, but will not tolerate any amendments to those bills. How can anyone be so authoritarian? How can anyone be so cavalier? How can anyone be so disrespectful of Canadian democracy and tell the 57% or 58% of Canadians who did not elect Conservative members that if their representatives do not fall into line with the Conservative platform, they cannot introduce amendments in this House?</ParaText><ParaText id="758586">I assure my colleagues that we are going to consider the issue and that we will work very quickly, with all due diligence. And we will introduce amendments if we feel that they are in the interest of the people we represent.</ParaText><ParaText id="758587">The government wants this bill to go to committee quickly. The leaders have agreed on this. Later today, the whip will introduce a motion, and once again we have offered to cooperate.</ParaText><ParaText id="758588">Next week, we will have this bill before us, but we will not allow ourselves to be led by the nose by this government. When the Conservatives were in opposition, they were intractable and often mean-spirited. They constantly, systematically filibustered. Never have I seen such filibustering. Sometimes it went on day and night.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp><ParaText id="758589">The current <Affiliation DbId="111560" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food</Affiliation> did the filibustering. He led this House in circles regarding employment equity. At the time, I was a young, naive and vulnerable member. I had just been elected and was experiencing my first filibuster. Furthermore, the current <Affiliation DbId="111551" Type="4">Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development</Affiliation> was uncompromising on the issue of employment equity, which was under the responsibility of the Canadian Human Rights Commission.</ParaText><ParaText id="758590">They cannot have it both ways. A person cannot say that it is fine to filibuster when they are in opposition, only to turn around, once they are in the governing party, and refuse the opposition's right to present amendments. This is irresponsible and disrespectful.</ParaText><ParaText id="758591">Bill <Document DbId="3076458" Type="3">C-2</Document> merges five pieces of legislation. Of those pieces of legislation, the Bloc Québécois supported four of them, with amendments. In committee, of course, we will not ask to repeat the work that has already been done.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758592">However, we have a problem with Bill <Document DbId="2397807" Type="3">C-27</Document>, concerning dangerous offenders. As we all know, the Criminal Code has included provisions on this matter since 1947. In the past, we did not use the term dangerous offender, but rather habitual criminal. I wonder whether certain members, those who have been practising law for some time, remember that expression. The Liberals already changed those provisions by creating a new category of dangerous offenders—long-term offenders—in Bill C-55.</ParaText><ParaText id="758593">What is our line of questioning? I would like to be clear. I am telling the government that the Bloc Québécois would like to see three main groups of witnesses. First, we would like to hear constitutional experts on the constitutionality of the reverse onus principle, in the same terms in which this bill was presented.</ParaText><ParaText id="758594">We would then like to see a second group of witnesses. I would remind the House that when the <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> appeared before the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, he was unable to tell us what it is about the administrative and judicial process for dangerous offenders that is not working.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758595">Currently, a person can be labelled a dangerous offender after committing a first serious offence. Section 753 of the Criminal Code is very clear. If there is any reason to believe that that an individual is likely to cause a death, is out of control, or is likely to reoffend, that person can be declared a dangerous offender after a first offence. I am not saying that this is what usually happens. We are not talking about a large number of people here. About 350 people have been declared dangerous offenders, and some of them have been released under mandatory supervision. Of course, most of them are inside federal prisons.</ParaText><ParaText id="758596">We will run this by constitutional experts. It is our responsibility to ensure that this bill is not unconstitutional. We will ask people who make their living dealing with this issue before the courts to explain to us which parts of the current legislation are not working.</ParaText><ParaText id="758597">We will also ask a third group of witnesses about the list of offences. In the bill before us today, five types of offences would result in an individual being declared a dangerous offender. Naturally, most of them are serious crimes, such as attempted murder, murder, homicide and serious sexual crimes.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758598">The government wants to expand this list to include 42 offences. The preliminary list includes 22 offences, one of which is assault. I do not wish to downplay the importance of assault. However, should an individual who has been convicted of assault three times be put on a list of dangerous offenders, with all of the consequences that entails?</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp><ParaText id="758599">There is a list of designated offences, which, I agree, are offences generally punishable by a sentence of more than five years. The question is, do we need to take this further? Is it important to have these two lists of offences?</ParaText><ParaText id="758600">Why ask this question? We are not questioning the fact that we need provisions in the Criminal Code for people who are so dangerous and present such a risk of recidivism that they need to be designated long term offenders, or dangerous offenders. A dangerous offender is someone who can be imprisoned for an indefinite period. Obviously, they are denied their freedom and denied eligibility for parole. Certainly—and I am not afraid to say so—this is justified in some situations.

I would like to take this opportunity to perhaps correct some of the motives the member attributes to the Conservative government in bringing forward this tackling violent crime act, Bill <Document DbId="3076458" Type="3">C-2</Document>, and then pose a question.</ParaText><ParaText id="758610">Toward the end of his remarks he asserted that our government is driven by partisan political considerations. I would like to state for the record that no, what we are driven by here is to try to reform our justice system or, maybe more appropriately, that we are driven by a desire to restore fairness and justice to our legal system in this country. </ParaText><ParaText id="758611">That is the real reason behind the fact that in our short-lived government we have brought forward so many new initiatives in the justice department. In fact, he mentioned the fact that we brought forward a dozen bills alone in this Parliament already.</ParaText><ParaText id="758612">The other fallacy that I would like to quickly correct for the record is this whole business that somehow by combining these bills we are going to delay them.

We have combined them because the Senate will be less able to stall one or two bills because Canadians will be awakened to the fact that if the Liberals stall Bill <Document DbId="3076458" Type="3">C-2</Document>, they will clearly understand that the Liberal Party has never been serious about violent crime.

As a country built by the imagination and dedication of many people, we truly understand the value of diversity within society. In fact, Canada is known internationally as a welcoming and compassionate country. Each year we admit more than 95 million people to our country, including 260,000 new immigrants. </ParaText><ParaText id="758661">While we encourage immigration, Canadians also insist on vigilance against people and organizations taking advantage of our generosity and openness. They pose a danger to our nation and, in some cases, to other nations around the world. They have committed serious crimes, or violated human rights or even taken part in terrorism. These people are not welcome in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="758662">Canadians do not want our doors to be open to people who endanger our national security and the safety of our communities. The government wants what Canadians want. That is why we are unwavering in our determination to safeguard national security and to protect the safety and security of the Canadian public.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758663">One of the most fundamental responsibilities of a government is to ensure the security of its citizens, and this government has taken its commitment very seriously.</ParaText><ParaText id="758664"> The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act provides the government with a process to remove non-Canadian citizens who are inadmissible on grounds of security, violating human or international rights, serious criminality or organized criminality. When classified information is involved in support of the inadmissibility decision, the security certificate process may be used.</ParaText><ParaText id="758665">It has been in place for over 20 years, but it has only been used 28 times since 1991 in the most serious cases. Certificates have been issued against spies, terrorists and extremists. They can never be used against a Canadian citizen, and that is a very important part.</ParaText><ParaText id="758666">The reason Bill <Document DbId="3076462" Type="3">C-3</Document> has been introduced is quite straightforward. Security certificates are used to protect Canadians. They are a vital national security tool. At the same time, when we take steps to protect Canadians and national security, we must also take steps to respect civil liberties and protect our core values. These values include freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law.</ParaText><ParaText id="758667">In February the Supreme Court of Canada confirmed the use of security certificates generally. However, it found aspects of the security certificate process that required legislative improvement. In addition, various parliamentary committees have recommended changes to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758668">The government has moved swiftly and is taking action. Bill <Document DbId="3076462" Type="3">C-3</Document> is an essential public safety tool that enables us to continue to prevent inadmissible persons from remaining in Canada while ensuring that there is better protection of the rights of individuals subject to security certificates.</ParaText><ParaText id="758669">Bill <Document DbId="3076462" Type="3">C-3</Document> would set into law the Supreme Court of Canada's ruling on security certificates, and takes into consideration the recommendations of both Houses of Parliament. </ParaText><ParaText id="758670">We have acted to strengthen the law to address the findings of the court. Protecting both security and human rights can be a challenge. As the Supreme Court stated in its ruling, this is:</ParaText><ParaText id="758671"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">—a tension that lies at the heart of modern democratic governance. It is a tension that must be resolved in a way that respects the imperatives both of security and of accountable constitutional governance.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="758672">While the Supreme Court confirmed the use of security certificates generally and stated that one of the most fundamental responsibilities of a government was to ensure the security of its citizens, it found there was not sufficient opportunity to challenge the government's case.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758673">The Supreme Court identified areas where the security certificate process must be changed to better protect the rights of individuals subject to a certificate. The court noted that detention under the security certificate process did not constitute cruel or unusual punishment under the Canadians Charter of Rights and Freedoms if accompanied by a process that provided for regular opportunities for appropriate detention reviews.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp><ParaText id="758674">However, let me stress one important fact about the security certificate process. It is not about detention, but rather about removing non-Canadian citizens because they represent threats to public safety and national security. </ParaText><ParaText id="758675">Individuals named in a security certificate would be released from detention if they chose to leave Canada and return to their country of origin. Detention is meant to protect the safety and security of the Canadian public until they can be removed from Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="758676">Further, the court said that the certificate process did not violate section 15 rights under the charter; that is to say, equality rights. These are important findings.</ParaText><ParaText id="758677">It is clear that we need the security certificate process. It is a valuable public safety tool and the court has given the government an opportunity to amend the legislation by suspending the effect of key portions of its decision for one year.</ParaText><ParaText id="758678">In addition, it must be emphasized that if we do not pass this bill by February 2008, an important public safety tool would be lost. The government would be unable to issue new certificates against non-Canadian individuals who pose a threat to the security of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="758679"> In addition, individuals currently subject to a security certificate would succeed, on application, in having their certificates quashed. This means they would no longer be subject to detention or any conditions of release, which would pose serious public safety risks.</ParaText><ParaText id="758680">What changes did the Supreme Court of Canada say were needed?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758681">It found that the in camera <I>ex parte</I> proceedings do not provide the person named in the certificate a sufficient opportunity to know the case against him or her and challenge that case. The court ruled that a process had to be put in place to better protect the interests of individuals subject to security certificates.</ParaText><ParaText id="758682">It also gave foreign nationals the same rights as permanent residents in the context of detention reviews. In that light, it stated that these reviews should occur 48 hours after arrest and at least once every six months thereafter for both foreign nationals and permanent residents. These changes took effect immediately upon the court ruling.</ParaText><ParaText id="758683">The special advocate function will help ensure fair court proceedings and provide a means to challenge classified evidence.</ParaText><ParaText id="758684">As I have already mentioned, the Supreme Court indicated that a mechanism was needed to better protect the interests of individuals subject to a security certificate.</ParaText><ParaText id="758685">Bill <Document DbId="3076462" Type="3">C-3</Document> sets out that mechanism by introducing a special advocate in the Federal Court process to determine the reasonableness of the certificate.</ParaText><ParaText id="758686">The special advocate's core role would be to protect the interests of the subject by ensuring a person's interests are adequately represented during closed court proceedings. The special advocate would be able to challenge the minister's claim to the confidentiality of classified information, as well as its relevance, reliability, sufficiency and weight. The special advocate would also be able to make written and oral submissions to the court and question government officials involved in the case.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758687">It is important to appreciate that this model would strengthen an important public safety tool by making it fairer to the person subject to the certificate process, while recognizing the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential public security information.</ParaText><ParaText id="758688">How would the process work?</ParaText><ParaText id="758689">The <Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> will establish a list of persons with the qualifications set out in regulations, who may act as special advocates. Some of the qualifications which may be set out in regulations include membership in good standing in a law society of Canada, at least five years' relevant litigation experience, no conflict of interest and appropriate security clearance.</ParaText><ParaText id="758690">The special advocate will be able to communicate with the individual subject to a security certificate without any restrictions before he or she sees the classified information. At that time, the special advocate will have the benefit of an unclassified summary of the case to discuss with the subject. This should substantially assist the special advocate in preparing for the closed <I>ex parte</I> hearing.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758691"> The special advocate will then be privy to the classified information. Once that happens, the individual can no longer communicate with anyone about the proceeding while it is ongoing, except as specifically authorized by the judge. The special advocate may apply to the judge for permission to communicate with the subject of the certificate. If the judge grants the request, he or she may impose conditions, such as to communicate only by writing, to avoid the inadvertent disclosure of any confidential information.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp><ParaText id="758692">Another important aspect of the special advocate regime is that there is no solicitor-client relationship with the subject of the certificate. That is because it would likely create a conflict of interest for the special advocate in light of the restrictions on communication imposed once the special advocate has seen the classified information. </ParaText><ParaText id="758693">The nature of the solicitor-client relationship, in particular the duty of candour owed to the client by his counsel, might be construed as to require the special advocate to reveal as much as possible about the classified information to the subject of the security certificate. At the same time, the special advocate would be required to protect the classified information from disclosure.</ParaText><ParaText id="758694">Let me be clear that without the solicitor-client relationship, the special advocate can still protect the interests of the subject by challenging the confidentiality of the evidence as well as the relevance, reliability, sufficiency and weight of that evidence.</ParaText><ParaText id="758695">Aside from security certificate cases, other decisions made under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act may also involve the use of classified information. In the course of a judicial review of such a decision, a special advocate will be available if the judge, on a discretionary basis, concludes that considerations of fairness and natural justice require it.</ParaText><ParaText id="758696">Bill <Document DbId="3076462" Type="3">C-3</Document> proposes other legislative changes to meet the requirements of a Supreme Court decision, address a number of parliamentary recommendations and deal with gaps in the act.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758697">Other legislative changes proposed in the bill include: concurrent reasonableness hearings and risk assessments to streamline the proceedings and security certificate cases; permitting appeals of the decision on the reasonableness of the certificate upon certification, which is consistent with how all appeals under the IRPA are dealt with; confirming that foreign nationals have the same detention review rights as permanent residents, as the Supreme Court did express in its decision; and, transitional provisions to provide for the treatment of existing certificate cases under the new law in the most transparent and fairest manner possible.</ParaText><ParaText id="758698">I will now explain these proposed changes in a bit more detail. I will begin with concurrent processing. When a security certificate is issued, it is referred to the federal court to determine if the security certificate is reasonable. The individual subject to a certificate can also apply for protection from return to a country where the person would face a substantial risk of torture or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or risk to life. This is called a pre-removal risk assessment, or PRRA. As it now stands, the PRRA process takes place and the review of the reasonableness of the certificate is suspended until its conclusion. This is because the law provides that the judge who decides the reasonableness of the certificate must also decide on the lawfulness of the PRRA decision. This has caused delay.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758699">Bill <Document DbId="3076462" Type="3">C-3</Document> proposes to do away with the suspension of the reasonableness hearing. It provides that the Crown or the court may review the reasonableness of the certificate concurrently with the review of the lawfulness of the PRRA. The court's review would take place outside the certificate process without the need for the same judge to review both decisions. This approach seeks to limit the potential for significant delays that might result while waiting for a decision on the PRRA before having the court assess the reasonableness of a certificate.</ParaText><ParaText id="758700">The next proposal in the bill is to allow for the appeal of the reasonable determination and on decisions on detention if the judge decides a serious legal issue has been raised for the consideration of the Court of Appeal. This requirement, called certification of a question, is consistent with the way other decisions under the IRPA may be appealed.</ParaText><ParaText id="758701">Currently, the decision on the reasonableness of the certificate cannot be appealed but, practically speaking, the courts have recognized certain exceptions to this rule. Accordingly, appeal upon certification of a question will provide a mechanism that enhances fairness.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758702">The next change proposed by Bill <Document DbId="3076462" Type="3">C-3</Document> is almost a formality given that the Supreme Court has already deemed this change effective and in force. In fact, the court ruled that foreign nationals and permanent residents should have the same rights to detention review. This ruling means that since February, both permanent residents and foreign nationals are granted a review of their detention within the first 48 hours after arrest and every six months after that. Prior to this decision, the IRPA stated that foreign nationals were entitled to a detention review 120 days after the certificate was found to be reasonable.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp><ParaText id="758703">Finally, Bill <Document DbId="3076462" Type="3">C-3</Document> proposes transitional provisions that would allow for cases commenced under the previous legislation to recommence under the new legislative regime. This is to ensure that appropriate and orderly change from the old legislation to the new will provide the benefits of the new legislation to the current individual, subject to a security certificate.</ParaText><ParaText id="758704">As members can see, a great deal of thought has gone into this bill. Not only have we responded to the Supreme Court of Canada's ruling, but we have also been mindful of the recommendations made by committees in both Houses of Parliament. </ParaText><ParaText id="758705">We are offering more protection for individuals, subject to a security certificate.

						</PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="758710">moved that Bill <Document DbId="3073307" Type="4">C-426, An Act to amend the Canada Evidence Act (protection of journalistic sources and search warrants)</Document>, be read the second time and referred to a committee. </ParaText><ProceduralText TocType="TPC" id="12">Bill C-426. Second reading</ProceduralText>
							<ParaText id="758711">He said: Mr. Speaker, I believe this is the second time that I have the honour of addressing the Chair regarding this bill. It is because of the parliamentary recess and prorogation that I have an additional hour of debate. However, I do feel the need to summarize what I said when the bill was introduced for the first time. Following this new process, many people may think, when they read <I>Hansard</I>, that this legislation is being debated for the first time. So, this is an opportunity for me to respond to a few questions, and even to some criticism that I have heard since the introduction of this bill. </ParaText><ParaText id="758712">It is true that I have been interested in this issue for a least some 30 years, perhaps even longer—since 1968, in fact. I remember that, at the time—this was before the Charter—we were hoping for legislation to deal with what this bill is addressing. The Charter allowed us to make some progress, but not enough. I find it deplorable that the journalistic practice that I want to protect with this legislation has not been better protected here, even though it has been protected to some extent by the Supreme Court of Canada. The fact is that a very large number of countries in the world, which abide by the same principle of press freedom, have passed laws to ensure such protection. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758713">It is important to first understand this: I am not asking that privilege be bestowed upon journalists. What I am asking for is what the bill would establish: protection for these individuals who we have to recognize have the courage to expose scandals, instances of misappropriation or fraud, and who might face reprisals, should their identity be revealed. The risks they face can run high, depending on the organizations they go after, for example when there is fraud within major organizations.</ParaText><ParaText id="758714">We are talking about a journalistic practice that has developed over the past 50 years and which is generally recognized as a good thing in our societies. In fact, these individuals who become aware of situations where funds are misappropriated take this information to a journalist. In return, the journalist offers confidentiality, promising never to disclose their name without their consent. That journalistic activity is what this bill seeks to protect.</ParaText><ParaText id="758715">Usually, journalists look into the matter brought to their attention. They are guided in their investigation by this confidential source, but do not reveal the scandal until the facts can be independently confirmed and they believe it is in the public interest to make the misappropriation known. </ParaText><ParaText id="758716">The first part of the legislation would enshrine this journalistic practice whereby a journalist may promise his sources that they will remain anonymous for as long as they see fit or fear reprisals. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758717">I also want to protect the practice of journalism. I might add that journalists should not be regarded as auxiliary police, as Supreme Court judges have pointed out in R. v. Lessard.</ParaText><ParaText id="758718">There are therefore five major provisions in this bill. The first one provides for the protection of journalistic sources, as set out in subclauses 3 to 6, the first two subclauses dealing with definitions and application respectively. As for subclause 7, it provides for something special: lesser but nevertheless very significant protection for unpublished journalistic material. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp><ParaText id="758719">The objective here is that journalists not be perceived by the public as aiding the police. Usually out of laziness, the police want to give journalists information that they themselves have decided not to release. This is especially true in the case of demonstrations or strikes that turn bad.</ParaText><ParaText id="758720">The third part refers to issuing search warrants, the conditions for such warrants and conducting the search. Finally, subclause 11 provides a simple way of publishing information under the Canada Evidence Act. It seems to me that there is no need to require someone to appear. A publication is a publication. All someone would have to do to prove that something has been published is produce the publication.</ParaText><ParaText id="758721">As with any right or duty we want to grant or any value we want to protect, we have to think about other values that may conflict with those we want to protect. Certainly, nearly all the members of this House recognize that the journalistic practice of protecting confidential sources has made it possible to shed light on serious misdoings. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758722">History is filled with such cases, the most famous being Watergate, the Enron scandal and even the sponsorship scandal. In my opinion, confidential sources will likely be increasingly necessary and common as companies secretly try to circumvent environmental protection rules, for example. A journalist would need to be pointed in the right direction in such a case. Here again, journalists will always have to base what they write on evidence they have obtained independently, or else pay damages in case of libel. Their papers will have to pay as well, which is why newspapers are fairly cautious in using this journalistic practice. Our intent is not to create a licence to commit hidden libel.</ParaText><ParaText id="758723">Since we are talking about a social value and not a privilege given to a certain category of people, the bill provides that judges themselves may raise the issue if they see that there is a problem of a confidential source. Judges may—I am not saying they must—raise the issue and ask the lawyers for their opinion. In this way, judges can protect the source against a negligent journalist who promised to protect a source but did not take steps to do so or no longer objects to the source's identity being revealed. Because the bill aims to protect the source, judges may raise this issue on their own initiative.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758724">This tool is well defined in clause 5. A judge can weigh the values that may lead to contradictory decisions.</ParaText><ParaText id="758725">I was asked what judge this refers to. If we understand the section well, it means the judge before whom the journalist testifies or a judge who is asked to order the journalist to disclose their sources. This can mean a number of different types of judges who preside over criminal or civil courts, or even a federal court, as is currently the case. The judge could nonetheless order this disclosure, but only if the judge considers it to be in the public interest or if the following conditions are met.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp><ParaText id="758726">The person has done everything in their power to discover the source of the information and the disclosure is in the public interest, having regard to the outcome of the litigation—that which is at stake—the freedom of information, and the impact of the journalist’s testimony on the source. Obviously, they will assess whether the source did indeed tell the truth or not and whether they committed a crime or not. It is still quite possible to have cases on this issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="758727">As far as clause 7 is concerned, perhaps because it is short, some people did not exactly understand the significance of it. This is the third part of the legislation I am proposing.The purpose of this clause is to protect a journalist's information, namely unused footage for television. Journalists must not be perceived as auxiliary police, as an easy place to go to for evidence of wrongdoing during a demonstration, for example. That was the context of most of the cases I dealt with in my career as a pro bono legal advisor.</ParaText><ParaText id="758728">The courts have been very clear about their reasons for accepting such a thing. For example, Justice La Forest, in Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. Lessard, said:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758729"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Freedom of the press is vital to a free society and comprises the right to disseminate news, information and beliefs. The gathering of information could in many circumstances be seriously inhibited, if government had too ready access to information in the hands of the media. The press should not be turned into an investigative arm of the police. Thus, the fear that the police can easily gain access to a reporter's notes could well hamper the ability of the press to gather information. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="758730">Clause 7 seeks to protect that freedom. It sets out the exceptional situations in which it might apply.</ParaText><ParaText id="758731">The rest of the bill, except for the last subsection, deals with search warrants. I have basically summarized existing case law, which is much clearer on this issue than on the first one my bill addresses. I have explained all of this in detail before, and people can review the record.</ParaText><ParaText id="758732">I also want to point out that this principle has been recognized in most European countries. It has been recognized in 32 of the United States through legislation and in 18 others through case law. There is one major exception in the United States: the principle is not recognized in federal legislation, but it is widely recognized elsewhere.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758733">In Sweden, the principle was considered so important that it was enshrined in the Swedish constitution. England does not have laws to protect journalists, but the European Court of Human Rights overturned the conviction of a journalist who refused to reveal a source he had promised to keep anonymous.</ParaText><ParaText id="758734">It is clear that this journalistic practice is widely recognized in the civilized world. The principle is recognized in Canada, but I think that it now makes sense to enshrine it in law to simplify things and to guide the people involved, such as police officers, journalists and justices of the peace who issue warrants. </ParaText><ParaText id="758735">The courts will decide whether this complies with the charter or not. The charter recognizes basic rights, but in a society like ours, people have much more than basic rights. It makes sense to define those rights in relation to the charter, of course, but sometimes we need to go beyond the charter. Parliament must step up to the plate and must not leave the toughest problems to the judges.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

						<Content><ParaText id="758737"> Mr. Speaker, that is a very good question. I had also spoken about bloggers. Even though I use computers, I am not a computer geek.</ParaText><ParaText id="758738">That depends. I established a fairly broad definition that can be adapted to new technologies. That is why we do not refer to the type of media but rather to the activity of a journalist. In this regard, my colleagues will certainly agree with me that this definition fully covers the journalistic activity and that the journalist is the individual who carries out this activity. A journalist is a person who contributes regularly and directly to the gathering, writing, production or dissemination of information for the public through any media. </ParaText><ParaText id="758739">I could have easily answered that we are not talking about the occasional blogger. However, out of respect for the member and the question he posed, it could cover the evolution of journalism towards electronic newspapers. In my opinion, that is important.</ParaText><ParaText id="758740">I would also have expected my colleague to have asked a question regarding “anyone who assists such a person”. This part—“anyone who assists such a person”—concerns the application of this section. You must realize that it is the source we wish to protect and not the journalist.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758741">In other countries where the law has granted this protection to the source, police officers have questioned housekeepers, printers and other persons. That is why it was necessary to insert “anyone who assists such a person” in the legislation. It goes without saying that it is in the context of the preceding definition.</ParaText><ParaText id="758742">I would like to add something else before answering another question: it must be understood that it is difficult to craft a perfect law from the outset. During the session, the government showed us how difficult that can be.

Indeed, paragraph 2<I>(b)</I> of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms specifically provides a constitutional guarantee whereby everyone has fundamental freedoms, namely freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication. </ParaText><ParaText id="758754">However, I wish to point out with all due respect that protecting freedom of the press is not the issue here. Rather, we must determine whether the provisions of Bill <Document DbId="3073307" Type="4">C-426</Document> improve existing legislation and allow us to ensure a fair balance between the interests of the state, when it investigates crimes and prosecutes criminals, and the public interest that consists in protecting journalists who are seeking the truth from state intervention.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758755">I commend the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78405" Type="2">Marc-Aurèle-Fortin</Affiliation> for trying to include in legislation protections offered in common law for journalistic activities. I know he has been studying this issue for a long time. Nonetheless, this area of law is very complex and it is extremely difficult to formulate legal provisions that cover all relevant considerations. </ParaText><ParaText id="758756">I feel it is important to remember that the general rule in penal law and civil law is that all information that concerns a trial is admissible. Confidential information is an exception to this general rule. </ParaText><ParaText id="758757">The law of privilege has over time become a means for protecting individual relationships that are essential for the administration of justice or for society in general. Solicitor-client privilege, police informer privilege and spousal privilege are well-known examples.</ParaText><ParaText id="758758">It is important to realize that privilege in effect denies both the state and the parties involved in the case, including defence lawyers in a criminal trial, access to information that could be quite useful. A change to the law of privilege, and even an attempt to include in legislation what already exists in common law, could have far reaching repercussions on the administration of justice and on the public's confidence in the justice system as a whole.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758759">There are provisions in Bill <Document DbId="3073307" Type="4">C-426</Document> that raise concerns.

For example, Bill <Document DbId="3073307" Type="4">C-426</Document> says that the provisions designed to protect journalists take precedence over any other federal legislation. This means that a journalist who has information pertaining to national security could use the provisions in this bill to make it very difficult for government to have access to this information, if and when necessary.

					<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. St. Amand" id="2180527"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78591" Type="2">Mr. Lloyd St. Amand (Brant, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="758764">Mr. Speaker, like my Bloc colleague across the way, the mover of the bill, I am very pleased to join in this debate and speak on Bill <Document DbId="2432417" Type="4">C-426</Document>, which is, as we have heard, an act to amend the Canada Evidence Act.</ParaText><ParaText id="758765">The substance of this bill is the protection of the confidentiality of journalistic sources. It would, in short, allow journalists to refuse to disclose information or a record which has not been published unless that information or that record is of vital importance and could not otherwise be produced in evidence in any other fashion.</ParaText><ParaText id="758766">The bill, as I read it, would also stipulate conditions which must be met or complied with before a judge issues a search warrant to obtain information or records in the exclusive possession of a journalist. </ParaText><ParaText id="758767">The bill would also allow journalists to refuse to disclose the source of the information which they gather, write, produce or otherwise disseminate to the public through any media and to further refuse to disclose any information or document that could identify a source or sources.</ParaText><ParaText id="758768">However, a judge would have at his or her discretion the authority to order a journalist to disclose the source of the information if that judge considered the information or the data to be in the greater interest of the public.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758769">I am inclined to vote in favour of the bill at least going to committee stage, with the expectation that the committee members would see fit to amend the bill when they scrutinize it.</ParaText><ParaText id="758770">There have been various court decisions on this topic. Generally, Canadian courts have followed the ruling in a decision from Great Britain, cited as Attorney-General v. Mulholland. The nub of that decision is that journalists should only be required to reveal information received from a source in confidence when it can be demonstrated that the information is relevant and necessary in order for the case to be resolved.</ParaText><ParaText id="758771">Closer to home, one of the best known cases on the issue of journalistic freedom is the case involving the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I> reporter Juliet O'Neill. Members of the House will recall that Ms. O'Neill, a journalist writing for the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I>, wrote an article on November 8, 2003 about Maher Arar, the Syrian-born Canadian citizen whom American authorities arrested and wrongly deported to Syria.</ParaText><ParaText id="758772">In January 2004, some several weeks after her article, the RCMP obtained two search warrants to search Ms. O'Neill's home, as well as her office at the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I>. The warrants were issued by a justice of the peace in support of a criminal investigation into alleged violations of the Security of Information Act.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758773">The searches of Ms. O'Neill's residence and office took place on January 21, 2004, and resulted in the seizure of certain documents and certain computer information. Needless to say, Ms. O'Neill did not agree to the searches taking place either at her home or at her office.</ParaText><ParaText id="758774">The matter found its way to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice and an extensive hearing over several days took place in the late summer and early fall of 2006. The Superior Court Justice struck down various subsections of the Security of Information Act, ruling that the subsections violated both section 7 and section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. We know that section 7 in particular deals with “the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived” of those rights “except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice”.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="00">(1400)</Timestamp><ParaText id="758775">In commenting on the subsections of the Security of Information Act, the justice held that the subsections were overly broad, arbitrary, vague, and gave the government an unfettered ability to protect whatever information it chose to classify as unauthorized for disclosure and to punish any violation by way of a criminal offence. In short, the justice ruled that the subsections were of no force and effect.</ParaText><ParaText id="758776">After the decision of the court, the federal government announced that it would not appeal the decision and that it would consider its options. In February 2007, the special Senate committee on the Anti-terrorism Act released a report recommending that the Security of Information Act be amended to narrow the scope of information for which disclosure is an offence. </ParaText><ParaText id="758777">As always, the issue is the proper balance to be struck between the public's right to know, broadly speaking, and the interest of the public with respect to security matters. Clearly, it is essential for the government to be able to prevent or deter the release of certain types of data in the interests of national security and that deterrence can and should include the imposition of criminal sanctions. But public discourse is a vital part of any democracy, as was expressed by the Supreme Court of Canada in 1996, and I quote:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758778"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The freedom of individuals to discuss information about the institutions of government, their policies and practices, is crucial to any notion of democratic rule. The liberty to criticize and express dissenting views has long been thought to be a safeguard against state tyranny and corruption.</QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText><ParaText id="758779">As the well-known French author, Albert Camus, said, “A free press can of course be good or bad, but, most certainly, without freedom it will never be anything but bad”.</ParaText><ParaText id="758780">In my view, Bill <Document DbId="3073307" Type="4">C-426</Document> moves us further along with respect to the proper balance to be struck between journalistic freedom on the one hand, and the disclosure of information which is of critical importance and cannot be produced by any other means on the other hand.</ParaText><ParaText id="758781">Like the member opposite who spoke prior to me, amendments that I would like to see introduced at committee stage include a tighter or better definition of “journalist”. The definition of “journalist” as presently written in the bill is too broad and would undoubtedly be problematic. It is peculiar, however, that currently no federal or provincial legislation appears to define the term “journalist” nor does Canadian case law provide a consistent definition. Ideally, the committee will see fit to recommend an improved definition of the term “journalist”.</ParaText><ParaText id="758782">There are also a number of instances where the English wording of parts of the bill is weaker than the French wording. This situation can also be remedied through amendments at the committee stage.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758783">Simply put, my inclination is to support the bill proceeding to committee in the hope and expectation that amendments will be made at that stage.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="05">(1405)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Dewar" id="2180533"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78922" Type="2">Mr. Paul Dewar (Ottawa Centre, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="758784">Mr. Speaker, I support and speak in favour of this bill, along with my party. </ParaText><ParaText id="758785">Many things that have been discussed and put forward in support of this bill, but some of those ideas and concepts bear repeating. I hope to touch on a couple of other facets of the bill that are worthy of underlining.</ParaText><ParaText id="758786">I will say at the beginning that we do support this bill and, if there are ways to improve it, it will be done at committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="758787">One of the things that is most disturbing in any democracy is any attempt to close off or shut down the freedom of the press. Members will know of the most recent events around the world where the rights of the press have been suppressed. I think of the recent situation that we are watching with great unease in Burma. When we look at the freedom of the press, which seems to be challenged around the world these days, and certainly this has been documented, journalists are having a harder time doing their jobs.</ParaText><ParaText id="758788">Many of us in this place from time to time might disagree with how journalists contemplate or exercise that freedom but no one in this place would be in any way critical of their right to have an opinion and to ensure it is unfettered, with some obvious qualifications and responsibilities.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758789">I say that in general because this is too important an issue to play partisan politics with. This is a foundation of our democracy, that is, the freedom of the press and the freedom of those who are practitioners in the fourth estate, to ensure they are able to do their jobs without the state interfering unnecessarily.</ParaText><ParaText id="758790">Therefore, the bill in front of us is critical. What is being attempted here meets the nod test from us but we need to ensure there is more clarity for judges, that there are cleaner and clearer guidelines for judges.</ParaText><ParaText id="758791">We have mentioned the case of Juliet O'Neill from the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I>. Many of us, not only in my home town here in Ottawa, were aghast at what happened in that case. I think people right across the country and indeed those who were following the story internationally, were surprised, saddened and very concerned that this could happen.</ParaText><ParaText id="758792">If we look at what journalists' responsibilities are, they have many, but they have a responsibility to protect sources at times. We see this not only in the field of journalism but in the field of litigation. We see it with lawyers and with doctors. We actually see it with those who are from faith communities, that there is some delegation of trust. I think most people understand that there is an understanding and a responsibility of confidentiality.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758793">What is the responsibility of confidentiality, in this case of journalists, and the role of the state for reasons of national security? How are those two things dealt with? How do we navigate those waters?</ParaText><ParaText id="758794">The bill sets out to lay down some criteria that is important. A colleague from the Bloc has already spoken about this. The first couple of paragraphs of the bill are more or less descriptive and then we get into the meat of it, particularly when we get into section four, and that is the power of the judge. Judges may, on their own initiative, raise the potential application of subsection three and ask the prosecution and the defence and any other party to present an opinion on the matter. I think that gets things going.</ParaText><ParaText id="758795">Then we get to subsection five, which reads:</ParaText><ParaText id="758796"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">A judge may not order a journalist to disclose to a person the source of any information that the journalist has gathered, written, produced or disseminated for the public through any media, unless the judge considers....</QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="10">(1410)</Timestamp><ParaText id="758797">There is where we get the required clarity, the clarity that was required certainly in the case of Juliet O'Neill and other cases. We see from today's <I>Quorum</I> that some <I>La Presse</I> journalists are being challenged in this very area. I cannot get into the details of the case, nor will I, because it is being debated now, but I will just point to the fact that this is an ongoing concern. Certainly it does not just affect journalists like Juliet O'Neill, but at present also some journalists at <I>La Presse.</I></ParaText><ParaText id="758798">It means that this sequence of events where the judge must follow the laid-out criteria is what has been missing. Again, if there are other facets that need to be dealt with at committee, then so be it.</ParaText><ParaText id="758799">Proposed subsection 39.1(7) regarding disclosure states: </ParaText><ParaText id="758800"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">A journalist is required to disclose information or a record that has not been published only if the information or record is of vital importance and cannot be produced in evidence by any other means.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="758801">That is another important facet that had not been addressed. When we move on to proposed subsection 39.1(8) about search warrants, that certainly was a cause of concern before. It deals with the Criminal Code and talks about the criteria and the further clarity required.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758802">In essence, the bill is trying to fine-tune the debate we have had since freedom of the press has existed, and that is the time honoured tradition of those who are in the fourth estate being able to practise their trade on the one hand and on the other hand to make sure that if there are issues of national security, they have worthy protection, as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="758803">Because of the times in which we are living, it is of absolute critical importance that a balance be struck, and that the clarity that is needed for judges be provided. I say that because of some other considerations we will have before the House, in particular, Bill <Document DbId="3076462" Type="3">C-3</Document>, which was tabled today. </ParaText><ParaText id="758804">We have had concerns about how we deal with border security, as recently as yesterday when a retired colonel from the American military was not allowed into our country because of being on an FBI watch list. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758805">Freedom of the press and freedom of expression are critical in the atmosphere in which we are living. They are the foundation of our democracy. If we are not able to find the balance now, we will regret it later. If journalists are not able to protect their sources, we know what will happen. We have seen it around the world and in history. People will no longer come forward. It would not only affect members of Parliament in not being able to find critical analysis because information would not be shared, but citizens in general would not have the information they need to hold institutions to account.</ParaText><ParaText id="758806">I will end my comments with the plea that we need to follow up on this bill quickly. We need to support it in a non-partisan fashion because it is so important that all those in the business of journalism be able to practise their profession without any fear. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758807">We hope that the government will come forward on one other aspect that needs tweaking, and that is on freedom of information. The government promised after the passing of Bill <Document DbId="2158135" Type="3">C-2</Document>, the accountability act, that it would act on that. It is one thing to protect sources, but it is another thing to have access and a window to the business that government does.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="15">(1415)</Timestamp><ParaText id="758808">While we need speedy passage of this bill, which is something we support, we also look forward to and hope that the government will fulfill its promise to bring forward changes to the freedom of information act. Until that time, we know that it will be difficult for journalists not only to ply their trade, but to have a clear window on what government is doing.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

For that is the issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="758810">Bill <Document DbId="3073307" Type="4">C-426</Document> does not grant a privilege to journalists, nor to the media. The bill, and particularly the section dealing with searches, protects journalistic activity. It clarifies and protects the most noble elements of journalistic activity, freedom of speech and the public's right to information, conditions which are essential for democracy. </ParaText><ParaText id="758811">In cases of wrongdoing or in any other action that causes harm or injustice, it is normal that a citizen who understands these values would be tempted to alert the public and thus help identify and denounce the errors committed.

							<ParaText id="758812">However, if the justice system can count on clear legislation such as BIll <Document DbId="3073307" Type="4">C-426</Document>, a citizen who witnesses a fraudulent act or one that harms someone will feel comfortable informing the public through a journalist, in an attempt to improve our society. Similarly, journalists will feel comfortable publishing this information if the conditions allowing them to protect their sources are clearly set out in the legislation. Society can only benefit.</ParaText><ParaText id="758813">In September 2005, the Fédération professionnelle des journalistes du Québec took a stand on the matter by publishing a report entitled “Protection des sources et du matériel journalistique”. The report was written by Marie-Claude Pednault and is available in French on that organization's Web site. I invite all my colleagues in the House to read it. I would like to quote part of that report.</ParaText><ParaText id="758814">
								<Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">In January 2004, in <I>R v. The National Post</I>, Justice Mary Lou Benotto of the Superior Court of Ontario pointed out that the evidence heard demonstrates that the use of anonymous sources is crucial to uncovering and reporting information of interest to the public. According to the judge, forcing a journalist to break a promise to not disclose the name of a source would cause considerable harm to the public's right to information. Justice Benotto referred to a very interesting comparison made the House of Lords in Britain: if the identity of police informers could be revealed in a court room, police informers would stop informing, and the police would be very limited in their duty to prevent and solve crimes. To force journalists to reveal their sources could have similar repercussions on the freedom of the press.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758815">Closer to home, in the Supreme Court of Canada ruling Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. Lessard, Justice La Forest wrote:</ParaText><ParaText id="758816">
								<Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">I have little doubt, too, that the gathering of information could in many circumstances be seriously inhibited if government had too ready access to information in the hands of the media.

Consequently, can this House afford not to pass Bill <Document DbId="3073307" Type="4">C-426</Document>, given how clear and relevant it is? I do not think so.</ParaText><ParaText id="758820">It would not be the first time a country has passed legislation enabling journalists to protect their sources. In her 2005 report, Ms. Pednault says that legislation to protect journalists has been passed in 31 American states and the District of Columbia. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758821">In Sweden, protection of journalists in both the print and electronic media is enshrined in the constitution. The Swedes are so convinced of the importance of protecting journalistic sources that a journalist who reveals the identity of a source can face criminal prosecution.</ParaText><ParaText id="758822">Protecting sources is not the only important consideration when it comes to freedom of expression and information. It is just as important that the public sees the media as independent from the government and its public safety agencies.</ParaText><ParaText id="758823">Media credibility is crucial to the public's perception of what they see in the media. Under Communist rule in the former USSR, if <I>Pravda</I>, the official government newspaper, reported that the potatoes were excellent that year, people would stop buying them. I am joking, but you can see that this is not so far from reality. On issues such as the neutrality of journalistic information, the smallest suspicion creates doubt in people's minds. We who work in politics understand this all too well.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="758824">Now, after having explained why I think Bill <Document DbId="3073307" Type="4">C-426</Document> is so important and so relevant, I want to emphasize one final, essential aspect of the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="758825">Although the bill clearly defines the conditions with respect to disclosure of sources, disclosure of unpublished documents, warrants for documents and the publication of information following a warrant, it maintains the judge's right to apply the subsection that recognizes a journalist's right not to reveal a source except under the conditions set out in the bill. In such cases, the judge must ask the prosecution, the defence and any other party to the cause to submit their opinions on the matter.</ParaText><ParaText id="758826">That way, the judge can protect a source known to a journalist as defined by the bill who does not have sufficient resources to make full answer and defence. I appreciate my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78405" Type="2">Marc-Aurèle-Fortin</Affiliation>'s experience and rigour, which minimized the loopholes that could have undermined the protection provided by the law.

There is also an extremely important public interest in pursuing truth in another arena, and that is in the context of legal proceedings, especially criminal trials where the innocence and liberties of a person are at stake.</ParaText><ParaText id="758834">There is thus the potential for the pursuit of truth by the journalistic context to clash with the pursuit of truth at trial.
