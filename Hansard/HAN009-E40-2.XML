My intention was to show the horrors of the war, since innocent civilians can be the victims, as well as the destruction it causes. However, before forwarding the bulletin to all members, I did not consult all the links included in the email, as I should have. Some of those links lead the reader to sites with videos containing hate propaganda, which I do not support in any way; in fact, I condemn it. </ParaText><ParaText id="1269225"> I wish to offer my sincere apologies to this House and to my fellow members for having forwarded such an email. Please be assured, Mr. Speaker, that I will be extremely vigilant and exercise greater care in the future, and that this kind of mistake will not happen again.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Petit" id="2583530"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128869" Type="18">Mr. Daniel Petit (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1269226">Mr. Speaker, we have heard the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128590" Type="2">Ahuntsic</Affiliation>'s apology. However, I would like to raise a few points in connection with this situation. </ParaText><ParaText id="1269227">A member of Parliament's privilege is based on two things: the rights and privileges granted by Parliament. In the course of our duties, we use items provided for the exclusive use of parliamentarians for the purpose of carrying out the mandate we have been given by our fellow citizens. </ParaText><ParaText id="1269228">Various documents and emails were sent to our BlackBerries, prompting me to take a look at what the member for Ahuntsic wanted me to see. I received several mentions of photos and texts, and I consulted them. Also, links to groups considered by Canada's Parliament to be terrorist organizations had been inserted into the member's material, either by her or by the employees she is responsible for.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269229">These links can be considered very serious. The Parliament of Canada's policy is clear: ours is a peaceful nation that does not, in any way, condone terrorist organizations. Anyone could end up on the member's site. Millions of people around the world can surf their way to it. People from other countries can visit the site, where they can see the member's name and her riding. They might not understand how our parliamentary system works, so they might think that the text and the links on the site represent Canada's position, even though parliamentarians in the House of Commons have always refused to support, in any way, shape or form, terrorist organizations. </ParaText><ParaText id="1269230">Imagine someone in Asia finding the member for Ahuntsic's site on the Internet. That person would see all kinds of sad things, as well as videos encouraging certain forms of terrorism that we have condemned.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269231">That is important to understand. Parliamentarians in the House of Commons must always support Parliament's policies. If a member thinks that it is okay to flout the rules of Parliament, how can we expect citizens to respect the laws that we pass? It would be impossible, and that is very serious. It makes it look as though Canada is adopting the position of this distinguished member of our Parliament who is known in her region for her opinions. In fact, this is not true, and this is not Parliament's position. In fact, we here in Parliament have decided to work for peace and not in support of terror.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269232">When a member uses the means at her disposal, it is paid for by the taxpayers from both east and west. We have constituency offices and offices here on the Hill; our computers were bought with taxpayers' money. How can a member promote the things that we have condemned here in Parliament? </ParaText><ParaText id="1269233">Citizens cannot do this, and the members of this House are also citizens. We must respect the decisions of Parliament. That means that in no way, directly or indirectly, should we be supporting terrorist movements. This is serious. I defer to your judgment, Mr. Speaker.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="05">(1005)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1269234">However, we must send the right message. If a parliamentarian does not respect the rules of Parliament, how can we expect a citizen to respect them?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mrs. Jennings" id="2583575"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128273" Type="2">Hon. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1269235">Mr. Speaker, as you know, I am the one who rose in this House yesterday to raise this matter of privilege. I spoke briefly on it at that time and I would just like to acknowledge the statement by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128590" Type="2">Ahuntsic</Affiliation>. </ParaText><ParaText id="1269236">The hon. member admits in this House that she has failed in one of the fundamental duties of a member of Parliament, which is to act and to work with diligence and care and to make use of the human and material resources allocated to us by the House so that we may fulfill our responsibilities as members. Each of us, therefore, has a duty to ensure that the resources of the House are used, as I said, with diligence and in such a way as not to violate the privilege of either our other colleagues in the House or the House itself. </ParaText><ParaText id="1269237">We have heard the admission, the statement by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128590" Type="2">Ahuntsic</Affiliation>. In it she admits that: first, she did indeed distribute all this information by email to the members' personal Blackberry addresses; second, that some of the information and images contained in the material she distributed incited hatred toward a religious group, namely the Jews, and glorified certain organizations that have been declared legally by legislation passed in this House as terrorist organizations; and third, that she has been remiss in her duties as a member of Parliament. This breach of her duties is at risk, first of all, of being prejudicial to all other members but also—and even more important—of discrediting the House itself.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269238">On January 29, 2003, another independent member, Jim Pankiw, who was at the time representing Saskatoon—Humboldt, raised a question of privilege. He alleged that his privileges had been violated by deputy ministers of various departments because they had given directives to their staff not to respond to an email he had sent to everyone—in excess of 200,000 public servants—and in fact to simply delete the message. His messages in fact were blocking the computer operations of those departments. Mr. Pankiw claimed this was in violation of his rights.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269239">Mr. Speaker, you yourself brought down a ruling at that time indicating that the sending of spam using resources—such as computers, Internet service and so forth— provided to members by the House to enable them to assume their responsibilities and do their job as members of Parliament constituted a violation of privileges. It was indeed spam that the hon. member was sending. You gave the directive at that time to all members to use these resources with diligence and care and said that if a member persisted in acting in such a way, the House would sanction him by disconnecting his computers and Internet service. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269240">We have heard the statement by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128590" Type="2">Ahuntsic</Affiliation> indicating that she failed in her fundamental duty as a member of Parliament, that is to use the resources allocated to her—as they are to us all moreover—carefully so as to ensure that their use did not cast discredit on the reputation of the House itself and did not violate the privileges of other members. This merits a sanction. I would suggest that sanction take the form of a warning, namely that if, in future, any member committed this same type of action, his or her services would be cut off, as you ruled in the case of Mr. Pankiw. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1269241">This action by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128590" Type="2">Ahuntsic</Affiliation> goes far further than what was done by Mr. Pankiw, and is far more serious. The spam he sent out blocked certain systems for a period of time, but did not incite any identifiable group to hatred nor glorify any organizations which the government has labelled as terrorist under legislation enacted by this House. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Guimond (Montmorency—Charlevoix—Haute-Côte-Nord)" id="2583626"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128173" Type="2">Mr. Michel Guimond (Montmorency—Charlevoix—Haute-Côte-Nord, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1269242">Mr. Speaker, I will be brief. We planned for an opposition day on a very relevant issue that was raised by our colleagues in the Liberal Party. I am convinced that all the members of this House are anxious to get to the debate planned for this opposition day.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269243">I would like to start by saying very respectfully that my two colleagues who spoke previously, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128194" Type="2">Charlesbourg—Haute-Saint-Charles</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="128273" Type="2">Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine</Affiliation>, were guilty of verbal overkill. Allow me to explain.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269244">My colleague from Ahuntsic quite obviously committed an error in good faith. Mr. Speaker, you know procedure inside and out, and you are the guardian of parliamentary privileges, but we are of the opinion that in determining whether or not there was a breach of parliamentary privilege, you should ask yourself whether the member acted deliberately or knowingly.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269245">Yes, an email was sent and forwarded. When my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128194" Type="2">Charlesbourg—Haute-Saint-Charles</Affiliation> refers to the member's own site, he is guilty of verbal overkill, because that is not the issue. The member for <Affiliation DbId="128590" Type="2">Ahuntsic</Affiliation> acknowledged in her speech that she had forwarded a news bulletin to her fellow members. She does not deny it. We all received a copy on our BlackBerrys. The question is whether she did so deliberately and maliciously.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269246">She further acknowledges that she neglected to check certain links in the email. In her statement, she said, “I did not consult all the links included in the email, as I should have”. What more does the member have to do? My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128273" Type="2">Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine</Affiliation> pressed the point. What more does she want the member to do? The member for Ahuntsic said, “I wish to offer my sincere apologies to this House and to my fellow members”. She is referring to all of us, regardless of party. She is apologizing to all 308 members who received the email.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269247">Lastly, she is looking to the future. She said that “I will be extremely vigilant and exercise greater care in the future, and this kind of mistake will not happen again”. I think that is clear.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269248">I well remember the Pankiw affair. He had flooded the system. He had sent 200,000 emails in a single day. This has nothing to do with the Pankiw case, which you yourself dealt with to everyone's satisfaction.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269249">Consequently, I think we should get on with the debate. The statement by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128590" Type="2">Ahuntsic</Affiliation> is sufficient to put an end to this matter. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We are friends, neighbours and family. We share common values. We believe in equality, democracy and the rule of law. We share common interests and we face common challenges, whether in security, the environment or economic policy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269302">The fact is, we trade $1.5 billion worth of goods and services every day across the Canada-U.S. border, and since 1989 <?bk?>Canada-U.S.<?ek?> trade has more than tripled to over $700 billion this year. That increase is about 10% every single year. </ParaText><ParaText id="1269303">We are each other's biggest trading partners. In fact, Canada is the most important destination for exports from 39 U.S. states. The Canada-U.S. trade relationship is responsible directly and indirectly for seven million U.S. jobs.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269304">The U.S. economy is heavily dependent on trade and investment linkages with Canada and this interdependence between Canada and the U.S. has only increased over time. In fact, 40% of our bilateral trade is intrafirm, trade within divisions of the same company or corporate family.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269305">Companies on both sides of the border have integrated their North American operations to take advantage of economies of scale and to become more competitive in North America, and to compete and succeed globally.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269306">In terms of our energy market, Canada is the largest supplier of energy products to the United States, supplying 94% of U.S. natural gas imports, nearly 100% of electricity imports, and 35% of uranium imports used for nuclear power generation. </ParaText><ParaText id="1269307">The U.S. imports more petroleum from Canada than from any other country, including Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. This is particularly important, given the continued U.S. concern around energy security. </ParaText><ParaText id="1269308">The North American gas, electricity and oil sectors are highly integrated, as is our infrastructure for transporting energy and other commercial products. Our shared infrastructure is increasingly being organized on north-south continental lines.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269309"> Canada and the United States do more than simply trade. We build things together. The average North American car crosses the Canada-U.S. border the equivalent of four times before it is completed.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269310">Each province in Canada now trades more with the United States than with each other. Two-thirds of our trade between our nations is within established supply chains. Our economies are so intertwined that if we were ever to try to separate them, it would be like trying unscramble an omelette.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269311">Canada is also the largest purchaser of American exports. These facts are important because they illustrate why protectionism, whether in Canada or the U.S., is bad for both of our economies. Increasingly, during a time of economic crisis, protectionism anywhere can turn a downturn into a depression. That is what happened in the 1930s with the Smoot-Hawley tariff act, which raised tariffs on 20,000 goods and ignited retaliation globally against U.S. protectionist measures.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269312">The response from the government to the current situation in the U.S. and the rising protectionism has been late, and has demonstrated a lack of foresight in failing to see it coming during an economic downturn. At a time when some U.S. legislators are proposing buy American plans, the response from the NDP has been to support the U.S. buy American programs and to say that in fact we should introduce buy Canadian plans.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269313">If I look at what social democrat leaders and parties around the world are espousing today, they are espousing trade. They understand that in today's world, trade is critical, that during an economic downturn, the worst thing we could do would be to put up protectionist barriers.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269314"> I am hoping that during this debate we can convince the New Democrats to join their social democrat colleagues from around the world who understand the importance in today's modern global economy of trade in terms of protecting Canadian jobs and interests, because when it comes time to vote on this motion, if they do not vote to support the motion, that simply applies pressure to U.S. legislators to avoid these kinds of protectionist measures that can hurt Canadian jobs, they will be voting against Canadian interests.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269315"> I hope that during this debate we can have a rational debate that engages New Democrat members, Conservative members and Bloc members in what ought to be a less partisan approach to <?bk?>Canada-U.S.<?ek?> relations, an important foreign policy and trade policy area for us.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1269316">The fact is that President Obama has demonstrated great leadership this week. He has moved forward and has set a tone that I hope will have a significant influence on what happens in both the Congress and the Senate, not just on this issue but on future issues, because protectionism continues to percolate. There is a strong vein of protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269317">We have not seen that kind of leadership on this issue here in Canada from the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> or the <Affiliation DbId="128690" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation>. When we see American congressmen move forward with protectionist measures, we should be responding immediately. We should be working through established relationships. One of the problems is that the Conservatives have focused so much over the last three years on building relationships with Republicans that they have completely forgotten to build relationships with Democrats. They have put their narrow partisan agenda ahead of the interests of Canada, and now, when there has been a sea change in American politics, Canada is disadvantaged.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269318">This is really important, because on issues of foreign policy and trade policy, we cannot pick one party or another. We have to have bipartisan relations that are strong during the good times and that help protect our joint interests during the tough times. </ParaText><ParaText id="1269319">We must recognize the importance of the Obama agenda and how positive it can be not just for the Americans but for the Canadians, and the importance of our working with President Obama in terms of his priorities. Securing access for Canadian business to the U.S. market is one of our priorities, but how can we expect American politicians to take action on our priorities if we are unwilling to take action on theirs?</ParaText><ParaText id="1269320">If one looks at the Obama government's stimulus package, at the measures on greening the American economy, investing in education and creating the jobs of tomorrow, it is starkly different from the budget recently presented in this House by the Conservatives. It is no surprise that a green economy is a priority for the Obama administration. In fact, Ambassador Wilson recently stated:</ParaText><ParaText id="1269321"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">We should expect policies [from the Obama administration] designed to move the country noticeably away from a carbon-based economy.

We are going to invest in cleaning our oil sands operations and CO<Sub>2</Sub> sequestration more vigorously than in the past, in cleaner conventionals, cleaner oil and cleaner gas. We are going to invest more in alternatives and we are going to be the clean energy partner that Americans need and that Obama wants.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269324">We know that addressing climate change is a priority for the Obama administration. We know that as the U.S. moves forward with a cap-and-trade system and as the U.S. Congress moves forward with a form of carbon tariff aimed at imports from other countries, Canada will be disadvantaged. This is another case where the Conservative government is failing to look ahead. It is failing to look at the challenges of the future and to prepare for those challenges.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269325">The Obama administration realizes that bad environmental policy is ultimately bad economic policy. We have a responsibility to move ahead as a partner in progress with the Obama administration and the Americans and to build the clean energy solutions of the future. </ParaText>

The thickening of the Canada-U.S. border is a number one issue for many of them. The smart borders initiative introduced by the Chrétien and Martin governments has not moved forward effectively under the Conservative government. On January 23, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano issued an action directive on the northern border strategy. It reads:</ParaText>

As we have designed programs to afford greater protection against unlawful entry, members of Congress and homeland security experts have called for increased attention to the Canadian border.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1269329">That is ominous when we now see a January 23rd letter from the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security speaking of the risks at the Canadian border. Much of that is based on what I believe to be a false impression of our border and an impression we should be correcting. </ParaText><ParaText id="1269330">Once again, relationships come into play. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> should be speaking with the president. We should be reaching out to legislators and members of the Obama administration and making the case that this kind of thickening of the border will not enhance <?bk?>U.S. <?ek?>security and in fact, will do everything to undermine <?bk?>Canada-U.S.<?ek?> economic prosperity. But once again, there is silence from the Conservative government until the issue becomes a crisis.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269331">In terms of ITAR, the fact is that Canadian companies are subject to ITAR restrictions by the Americans which actually prevent Canadian companies in many cases from competing for and succeeding in obtaining U.S. defence and aerospace contracts.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269332"> We saw that as one of the principal reasons MacDonald, Dettwiler said that to succeed in achieving contracts with the U.S. Space Agency it actually had to become a U.S. company. That was one of the rationales. The company pointed to the fact that Australia and the U.K. have successfully negotiated exemptions from ITAR from the Americans, but we have not. We are a trade partner with the Americans. We are a security partner. We are a defence partner. We are a friend of the Americans, and it is inexcusable that the Conservative government has not negotiated ITAR exemptions from the Americans.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269333">It is clear that there needs to be greater cooperation and a better and stronger relationship between not just the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the president and their administrations, but between legislators.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269334">Another issue that we have seen in recent months is the negotiation on the bailout of the Detroit three.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269335">The Conservative government sat back and allowed those negotiations to proceed in the U.S. without trying to get a seat at the table, without having any influence on what was happening down there. While we were sitting up here saying that once the deal was done we could provide them with a commensurate amount of money, perhaps 20%, to reflect the Canadian auto sector's percentage of the North American operation, while that was going on and we were sitting back, American legislators, congressmen and senators, were demanding commitments from the auto sector companies to invest in jobs and good product mandates.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269336">Back in 1979 when the Chrysler bailout was being discussed, Gordon Ritchie, a Canadian negotiator, was part of those negotiations. Canada was successful at that time. Negotiators were successful in getting the mandate for the Chrysler mini-vans, which was a very successful mandate. Now we are at the end of the current negotiations and Canada does not have any leverage whatsoever. </ParaText><ParaText id="1269337">We saw the spectacle a few weeks ago when the <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> went down to Washington to meet with the auto sector leaders but they were all in Detroit. In fact, while he was in Washington he was not able to get any meetings with influential legislators. It is bad enough that we are not at the table, but the minister cannot even find the table. At the end of these negotiations, Canadian auto workers will be lucky to find crumbs off the table.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269338">It is critically important that we work together on an ongoing basis and that we do not ignore the Canada-U.S. relationship as badly as the Conservative government has done.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269339">These are just some examples--the border, the ITAR issue, the auto sector negotiations--of where the Conservative government, long before the current issue around protectionist policies in the U.S. Congress emerged, had already failed Canadians on the Canada-U.S. relationship.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269340">Behind every trade statistic is a personal relationship or a human story. Relationships are important. When building relationships in the U.S., they need to be bipartisan. As the Conservatives over the last three years fawned almost exclusively on the Bush Republicans, they missed the sea change that was going on in U.S. politics.</ParaText>

There is a new U.S. president who provides hope to Americans while our Prime Minister deals in fear. President Obama is a uniter. Our Prime Minister is a divider. President Obama is a multilateralist. We have a Prime Minister in Canada who is a unilateralist who does not trust multilateralist organizations. President Obama appeals to people's better angels. Our Prime Minister pits one group against another. President Obama is a dreamer. In Canada we have a Prime Minister who is a schemer.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269342">In a speech which Ambassador Wilson made on January 19, he said, “These personal relationships matter a lot in Washington, at all levels, especially with new administration officials and staff”.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269343">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has not built the relationships in the U.S. that are important to protect Canadian interests and it should not surprise Canadians because he has not built relationships within Canada. We should not wait for an economic and political crisis to build these relationships. It is a little bit like trying to fix the roof during a rain storm. We should not wait for an economic or protectionist crisis to point out the importance of Canada-U.S. trade and economic relations to the U.S. economy to American legislators. We should be communicating on an ongoing basis as allies and as friends.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269344">Building those relationships one by one during the good times is essential to protecting Canada's national interests during the tough times. On issues we have to look ahead. The Conservatives failed to see the protectionist sentiment brewing in Congress. They failed to see the political sea change happening in the U.S. They failed to recognize the importance of building relationships on both sides of the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269345">Wayne Gretzky, that great Canadian economic and political theorist, once said, “I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been”. The Conservative government has ignored where the world is going and where the Americans are going under their new leader.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269346">The Conservative government's narrow ideological and partisan focus in the U.S., in ignoring the Democrats, has hurt Canada's national interests. We cannot only focus on both parties in the U.S., we have to focus on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. It is not enough to deepen our relationship with the presidential administration. We have to one by one as legislators do more to deepen our relations with individual legislators.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269347">Premiers are tremendously important. The relationship that premiers and governors have is tremendously important. Four of the last six presidents were former governors. President Obama four years ago was a state legislator. These relationships are important. Governor Howard Dean once spoke to me about his relationships with Canadian premiers. He said that we are all in the same boat and there are a lot of commonalities. If the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> wants to deepen relations with the Americans and to improve his chance of defending our interests, he had better start with building better relationships with Canadian premiers. Bill Clinton was a governor. The former U.S. ambassador to Canada, James Blanchard, started as a governor. These relationships are critically important.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269348">The fact is relationships do matter. My leader knows people like Larry Summers, one of the chief economic advisers to President Obama, and Cass Sunstein, the regulatory czar of the Obama administration, and Samantha Power, a senior foreign policy adviser to the Obama administration. We need to reach out on a bipartisan basis in Canada to people like Frank McKenna and people like Gordon Giffin in the U.S., people like Derek Burney. There is a lot of expertise. We cannot be partisan in whom we work with in the U.S. or Canada on what is our most critical trade and foreign policy relations.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Within the stimulus bill, there is a provision that would only allow steel and iron from the United States be used for infrastructure projects as identified within the stimulus bill. </ParaText><ParaText id="1269377">Today we are cautiously encouraged to the news that the United States Senate has voted in favour of softening the buy American provision within this massive stimulus package. Our government has worked extremely hard with our American counterparts and we have made some great headway. We will continue to see this through to a successful conclusion.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269378">Why we are concerned about this issue is simple. It has been identified already in the House. Our government recognizes that in this time of global uncertainty, protectionism is not the answer.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269379"> We know from history that protectionist legislation winds up not only hurting the economy in which that protectionist legislation is moved, but it invariably hurts economies that surround it. We are telling our friends in the United States that now is not the time to shut the door. Seven million U.S. jobs are supported by trade with Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269380"> The reality is our North American economy is an integrated one and the stimulus package that is being put together will impact and has to benefit not only the Americans but also trading partners. As long as governments do not succumb to the lure of protectionism, the spillover effects of this stimulus package can be overwhelmingly positive. Given the magnitude of the challenges that we all face, no individual country is likely to be able to save itself without help from trading partners.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269381"> We are living in a world where economies are tightly interwoven, in a world where global supply chains are intertwined, a world where not only capital and products but ideas that our future travel great distances at an ever increasing velocity.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269382">It is worthwhile to remind ourselves that our closest economic relationship in the world is the one that we share with the United States. Raw materials and finished goods, services, finance and people criss-cross our border daily in volumes that are unmatched anywhere else in the world.</ParaText>

The United States is one of our largest sources of foreign investment and innovation, and we are its largest and most secure supplier of energy products, as well as being its biggest customers for agricultural exports.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269384">As the U.S. economy flourishes, so does our economy. All this contributes not only to our prosperity, but we believe it gives us a special understanding of our neighbours to the south.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269385"> I think we would all agree that there is a strong link between a healthy Canadian industry and our own competitiveness. Obviously competitiveness is a concern to all Canadians, to this Conservative government and to all members of the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269386"> The government is well aware that a central challenge facing businesses today is to improve competitiveness by increasing the value of product lines and reducing production costs. This is especially the case for the manufacturing sector, which has been adjusting to higher commodity prices, increased international competition and global economic challenges.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269387">The first thing I would note is our global competitiveness has improved significantly in recent years. According to the Global Competitiveness Report 2008-2009, published by the World Economic Forum, Canada's world ranking in global competitiveness moved up from 15th in 2004 to 10th place in 2008.</ParaText>

Governments around the world have found themselves moving into turbulent financial and economic waters, and certainly Canada is not immune. However, there is a general consensus among economists and experts that the Canadian economy will perform better while many other industrialized OECD countries will struggle over the next two or three years. This is largely due to the core strength of our economy. </ParaText><ParaText id="1269390">The balance sheets of our financial institutions are also in relatively good shape. Canada's financial system is one of the best in the world. It is sound, well regulated and well functioning. Nevertheless, because of globalization and the interdependence of the world financial markets, the Canadian economy is impacted by the adverse consequences of the current crisis.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269391">Looking beyond the current market turmoil, our focus should be on improving our productivity, as it is the fundamental determinant of our quality of life and our competitiveness.</ParaText>

Our government is committed to creating a competitive environment and putting in place support for business that encourages innovation and entrepreneurship, and rewards investment.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269394">Canada's economic action plan, to which the members opposite have given their support, addresses both the short-term downturn and the financial constraints, while also stimulating productivity in the long term. It will stimulate the economy through investments to build infrastructure, by reducing taxes and freezing employment insurance rates, by stimulating housing construction, by improving access to credit, and by strengthening Canada's financial system, helping Canadians access training programs, and supporting businesses and communities. </ParaText><ParaText id="1269395">Our economic action plan will provide over $20 billion in new tax relief over the 2008-09 year and the following five fiscal years.

Last year we approved a $2 billion increase in borrowing authority of Export Development Canada, and an increase of $1.8 billion in the borrowing capacity of the Business Development Bank of Canada. This is enabling them to offer additional credit to their clients.

This is in addition to $33 billion in funding that was provided in budget 2007 to build modern infrastructure to keep these gateways open for business.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269400">With many companies operating on both sides of the border, one-third of our trade is between related firms, it is in the national interests of both Canada and the United States to work together to find constructive solutions to the economic crisis. This is particularly critical in those industries that are especially closely integrated. For example, the auto sector represents 12% of Canada's manufacturing base and employs 130,000 people in Ontario alone. Vehicle production represents one-fifth of the North American total. The majority of this activity is in support of the big three automakers.</ParaText>

							<ParaText id="1269437">We might be tempted to believe that the situation is resolved and that this is the end of the story. However, it would be very dangerous to let the American government get started with protectionist measures. This will do nothing to stop the United States from taking what I would call their protectionist measures even further. Measures viewed as admissible under the WTO or even NAFTA could enable them to keep implementing protectionist measures. In fact, some articles could legitimize the United States' actions and enable that country to defend itself and possibly even win in court. So we have to be very vigilant and not let them put one over on us. </ParaText><ParaText id="1269438">In principle, when governments make purchases, companies from countries that have signed these agreements—like Canada and Quebec—have the right to submit bids. But that is just in principle. The two agreements include a number of exceptions, exceptions that say, among other things, that when it comes to contracts, governments can do whatever they want.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269439">Take, for example, a contract to build a government building. Contracts valued below a certain amount are excluded. If I remember correctly, that amount is $5 million under the AGP and $5 million in constant dollars under NAFTA. That being said, all transport department contracts for roads, bridges and so on are excluded. If I am not mistaken, this is not about construction contracts per se, but about the purchase of the structural steel and rebar used in construction. That part is much less clear. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269440"> Construction contracts are a service, whereas structural steel and rebar are goods. It is likely that Canada will contest the American measure claiming that it concerns the purchase of a good, which is covered by the agreements involving Canadian businesses. The United States will say in its defence that the purchases are part of a construction contract, not covered by the agreements. At first glance, the Americans appear likely to win their case, as I was saying. Unless I am mistaken, most purchases will not be made directly by the federal government. The buyer will be either a state or a municipality or a construction company. In all of these cases, the buyer is not covered by the agreements. So the issue is not with the awarding of contracts, but with the awarding of a subsidy, which is not covered. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1269441"> Will the subsidy be considered an indirect purchase by the arbitration tribunals, so that it would be considered illegitimate subterfuge aimed solely at enabling the United States to circumvent its commitments? It is hard to say. We are not familiar with jurisprudence that would enable us to guess how the international arbitration tribunals might decide. I am assuming that the two cases may be argued, although I am not a lawyer, and even though it seems to me that Canada's case could be very weak under the circumstances and in light of the limited pressure exerted by the Conservative government. </ParaText><ParaText id="1269442"> As the matter is very complex, we will likely get bogged down in a long, drawn out dispute. As a decision in this matter is likely to be made long after any contracts have been awarded, the legal avenue is of no interest. The matter must be resolved politically, and a request that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> raise the matter when he meets Mr. Obama seems perfectly legitimate. </ParaText><ParaText id="1269443"> American protectionism and legislation, such as the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Act, together with the increased cost of transportation, reduced the flow of trade and protracted the 1929 crisis. Some provisions of the Buy American Act of 1933 continue to apply in the United States, in the case of government procurement, for example. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269444">American protectionism in the steel industry was counterproductive. A study by the Institute for International Economics found that the Bush government's protectionist measures for the steel industry in 2000 were counterproductive. I have a text here that says:</ParaText><ParaText id="1269445"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">In 2000, President George W. Bush implemented protectionist measures for steel imports in response to pleas from the unproductive big businesses in that sector. The effects seem to have been negative in the end because the measures saved 3,500 jobs but destroyed between 12,000 and 43,000 in steel-using businesses. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1269446">These situations could be catastrophic for the United States—although not in the short term—and difficult for Canada and Quebec. In the long term, protectionist measures could spread around the world. The first response from other countries is significant: when one country imposes protectionist measures, other countries follow suit.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269447">Obama's stimulus plan proposes extending measures for American steel. This action would threaten Quebec's steel industry, which exports 40% of its production. In Quebec alone, 2,000 jobs would be on the line. The less stringent plan proposed by the Senate, which would add respect for international agreements to the controversial section, does not make this clause any less dangerous. Even though the clause is clearly protectionist and goes against the spirit of international agreements, it does not necessarily violate those agreements.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269448">Purchases made by American federal authorities are subject to NAFTA, but in the United States, almost all of the large contracts in the transportation sector are administered by state or municipal authorities or by private business, all of which are excluded from the NAFTA chapter on government procurement. This chapter deals with federal funding, and so those projects can be excluded, despite the fact that it is a type of subsidy in disguise.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269449">There is a huge risk. We are not in the time of barter anymore. Simple as things were, even back then people tried to pass off worthless items as being valuable. And so, when Europeans arrived in the new world, the aboriginals of the time were exploited and that has not stopped. Eventually, the financial market and high finance appeared and paper was created.</ParaText>

It has always supported the North American Free Trade Agreement. The United States is Quebec’s largest trading partner, and in these recessionary times, Quebec cannot stand to lose its access to the market of its most important trading partner. The Bloc would rather see a diplomatic solution than recourse to the courts as a way of resolving the dispute between Canada and the United States over protectionism. Although there is often a protectionist reflex in times of economic downturn, it is essential to keep markets open in order to encourage trade and economic recovery. </ParaText><ParaText id="1269452"> The Government of Canada has a solemn duty to put pressure on the United States and ensure that Quebec businesses can export to its markets. Although President Obama has apparently backed down on the Buy American Act, the government must keep up the pressure to persuade the United States to allow Quebec and Canadian companies to access the U.S. market. </ParaText><ParaText id="1269453"> Apart from these trade issues, the Conservative government has proved negligent in its management of the economic crisis. We will obviously be in favour of the Liberal motion.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269454"> As I was saying, Quebec is a trading nation. Our companies, and especially our cutting-edge companies, could not survive on just the domestic market. International exports account for one-third of Quebec’s GDP. If interprovincial trade is added, exports represented 52% of Quebec’s GDP in 2005. Protectionism is not in our interests, and that is why Quebec, and most of all Quebec sovereignists, massively supported the Free Trade Agreement with the United States and then NAFTA. The trade environment has worsened considerably over the last few years. Between 2003 and 2007, Quebec went from a large trade surplus to a $13 billion deficit. In 2007, every Quebecker therefore consumed $2,000 more than he or she produced. And that is not to mention our international trade balance, to which must be added another $5 billion deficit in interprovincial trade.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269455"> We obviously became a lot poorer last year. The steep rise in the Canadian dollar, fuelled by Alberta’s oil exports, reduced the competitiveness of Quebec businesses on the U.S. market, while at the same time a number of emerging countries were taking over world markets. Given the changes in the trade environment, our priorities will have to change as well. Our manufacturing industry was badly hurt by the worsening trade environment because it is more dependent on exports and more exposed to international competition than services are. The Bloc Québécois has long made access to international markets its most important trade priority. The changes that have occurred in the trade environment, especially the rise of China, have revealed cracks in the system. The major international agreements negotiated under the aegis of the WTO are not intended solely to liberalize trade but also to establish a certain number of rules and conditions that must be complied with in order to access world markets. This aspect of the agreements has been neglected over the last few years. </ParaText><ParaText id="1269456"> In order for us all to benefit from trade, we must do more than just liberalize it. We must also civilize it in order to have healthy international competition and clean up the terms of trade. If countries want to access foreign markets, they should have to abide by certain rules. </ParaText>

							<ParaText id="1269467">As I said earlier, the protectionist measures the United States is considering are in keeping with its Buy American Act, a vestige of the protectionist measures implemented in the wake of the great depression of 1930. Under that act, road construction, infrastructure construction, transit and airport projects that receive government funding are required to use American products. As a result, federal funding for road construction will be granted only if American steel and iron are used.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269468">The U.S. government is getting around NAFTA by funding work carried out by the states, which does not come under NAFTA. President Obama's plan contains a provision that would extend the Buy American clause to all sorts of projects, with the result that all projects funded by the recovery plan would have to use American iron and steel. At a time of economic crisis, such a measure would threaten 2,000 jobs in Quebec. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269469">President Obama announced that he was prepared to water down the clause. Early information suggests that the clause will be amended to indicate that protectionist measures must not contravene international agreements. Toning down the American bill will not solve problems affecting the steel industry in Canada and Quebec, but it will be much less damaging to Quebec industry than the Senate's initial bill, which wanted the Buy American clause to apply to all purchased goods.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269470">We are at an important turning point in what I would call the fight against the global economic situation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269471">For some time now, our government has also had the means, not to circumvent the spirit of free trade, but to bring forward solutions to protect certain industries in Canada and Quebec.

That is not what is happening in Colombia. President Obama has, moreover, indicated that he would not sign a free trade agreement with Colombia. For the Conservative government, however, it is a matter of a mad rush to see who can sign the most bilateral free trade agreements. As I said in my speech, what we favour is multilateral agreements.

These members read in a textbook that free trade is good, so they do not make any sort of intervention, attempt any sort of managed trade, or implement any policies that would lead to job development or industrial strategies in this country.

We believe that international free trade must be adjusted to increase the capacity of individuals to negotiate collective agreements, tackle gender equality issues and reinforce human rights, not diminish them. In the case of the Canada-Colombia agreement, this government's approach—and that of the previous government—has diminished human rights rather than advancing them.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269504">We also believe in respect for institutions that promote fair trade, such as the Canadian Wheat Board, as well as supply management. Our farmers and communities across Canada depend on these institutions to keep the local economy going. In our opinion, these fair trade organizations must be protected; however, the other parties, the Liberal and Conservative parties, do not believe in them.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269505">We also believe in agreements that respect the environment by relying on sustainable development. That is the main difference between the Conservative-Liberal coalition and the New Democratic Party. Free trade agreements have been used to contravene environmental regulations. Many companies have found ways to get around all the environmental regulations that most Canadians want.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269506">We believe that our fair trade agreements must serve to strengthen a policy and an approach based on sustainable development and respect for the environment. We also believe in fair agreements that respect economic diversity and also, for example, the existence of a third sector. We often speak of a public and private sector. However, there is also a cooperative sector, where communities can put together their economic resources in order to develop. I could give you many examples where the cooperative sector has strengthened local or regional economies. </ParaText><ParaText id="1269507">Thus, fair trade must be used to strengthen this economic diversity. In a sense, we believe in economic diversity. The Conservatives and the Liberals, who are working together, have similar views on trade and believe in only one approach: the private sector and big business. The right regulations can stimulate the economy. Otherwise we end up with a monoculture.

Essentially, the Great Depression, in part, came from a lack of regulation. Does that sound familiar? Of course it does.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269512">I would like to cite one of our international colleagues, the Australian Labor Party, which is part of the same international entity that the NDP is part of, and the new Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, who said, “The time has come, off the back of the current crisis, to proclaim that the great neo-liberal experiment of the past 30 years has failed, that the emperor has no clothes”.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269513">Prime Minister Rudd is referring to the fact that a lack of regulation, again, has put us back in the same kind of economic circumstances that we saw in the 1930s. Smoot-Hawley was not the cause. Smoot-Hawley was a right wing Republican attempt to deal with the crisis that began with no regulations, no protections in place for the public across North America.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269514">Curiously, this particular motion does not refer to what the antidote was for the Great Depression, which was not only a series of regulations to protect the public but, what the NDP has always been calling for, the great economic stimulus that came out of the New Deal. That was missing from the Republican approach. There was no economic stimulus. There was no investment. What Franklin Delano Roosevelt did with the New Deal was provide that economic stimulus that the NDP has been pushing now for months, convinced our Liberal partners to come on the majority coalition, and then they sold us out and went with the Conservatives.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269515">In any event, we will see if the Conservatives can be trusted to bring in that economic stimulus in a fair and effective way. Many of us do not believe that they can be trusted. Certainly, they have broken their word before. However, the point I am making is that it was economic stimulus in the New Deal that actually started to push the United States out of the Great Depression.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269516">Therefore, the first clause of the motion is factually wrong. It is, I guess, in keeping with the proud Liberal tradition, but aside from that factual error perhaps pretty innocuous.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269517">Second, it states:</ParaText><ParaText id="1269518"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">--this House calls upon the Government to intervene forthwith and persistently, with the United States Administration, and the Congress, in order to protect Canadian jobs,--</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269519">That is something certainly that we could support. That is something that we have been pushing for. However, let me preface my remarks in this regard with what is actually happening in the United States and in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269520">Since NAFTA was implemented in 1989, and we have the figures right here, there has been a hollowing out of Canada. Essentially, for most Canadians they have lost in real income. We have seen a loss of real income that is the equivalent for the lowest 20% of the Canadian population of about a month and a half of income. In real terms, they have lost a month and a half of income since NAFTA was implemented. For the lower middle class they have lost about two weeks of income. </ParaText><ParaText id="1269521">Each and every Canadian family in that income class, and we are talking about more than six million Canadians in those families, has lost about two weeks of income in real terms. The middle class has lost about a week of income in real terms for each and every year since NAFTA was implemented.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1269522">This is not solely a result of NAFTA. It is also because of the foolish economic policies or lack of economic policies that were put in by the Liberals. Like the Conservatives, they do not seem to change much as they bounce across the floor, but fundamentally we can say that the bottom line is that they have failed over the past 20 years. When most Canadian families are earning less in real terms than they were 20 years ago, one would think that one member of the Conservative-Liberal Party would say, “Well gee, maybe we should change our economic approach”.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269523"> What the NDP is saying, with a growing number of Canadians, is that since Liberals and Conservatives are not changing their economic approaches, we are looking to change the government. That is why we are seeing more and more New Democrats in this House of Commons as we go through each election. We understand that this is not sustainable. Telling the middle class to accept less every year and telling the poorest Canadians to accept much less every year is simply not a sustainable economic policy.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269524">I will just conclude my remarks on the Canadian income categories by saying that the wealthiest 20%, which is what these economic policies have been intended to do, not a flood upwards, the wealthiest 20% now take most Canadian income. The Canadian income pie is less and less equal, more and more skewed to corporate lawyers and to corporate CEOs. That is why the NDP is saying that we need a much more balanced approach, a much more mature approach, in keeping with what we are seeing around the world. </ParaText><ParaText id="1269525">We are saying in this motion that we want to intervene with the United States administration. The important thing to note is that when we are talking to President Obama and talking to Americans, we have to understand that they are going through exactly the same thing. Two right wing, radical free traders, Kenneth Sheve and Matthew Slaughter, who has the oxymoronic title of being a former economic policy adviser to George Bush, said in a recent issue of <I>Foreign Affairs</I>:</ParaText><ParaText id="1269526"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">[Income] inequality in the United States is greater today than at any time since the 1920s.

							<ParaText id="1269530">These explanations around the issue of so-called protectionism miss a basic point. U.S. policy is becoming more protectionist because the American public is becoming more protectionist, and this shift in attitude is a result of stagnant and falling incomes.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269531">It is no secret why President Obama was elected on a platform of renegotiating NAFTA, rebuilding it on a fair trade model. It is no secret why we have seen this in the House of Representatives. I was on the phone yesterday talking to friends of mine in the U.S. Congress. They are talking about these issues. The senate rejected senator McCain's ridiculous amendment, certainly not an amendment that was in keeping with the way most American senators felt. It was rejected 65 to 31. It is because Americans are increasingly concerned about the same income fall that we have seen.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269532">If we are intervening with the United States administration, we have to start on that basis. We have to start on the basis that these free trade agreements and all the economic right wing policies that have gone with them have not been good for American workers and they have not been good for Canadian workers. That is the fundamental problem. I would hope that at least one of our colleagues from the Conservative or Liberal Party would actually start to look at the real facts, the bottom line, not the textbook theory.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269533">We all know the textbook theory. I can spout the textbook theory as well as anyone in this House, but the real, practical results are a fall in real income for Canadians, a fall in real income for Americans, and that is why we are having to deal with these issues, where more and more workers are saying, “We have to protect jobs here at home”.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269534">How do we communicate with the United States administration and Congress? We can do it on a win-win basis.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1269535">I will cite the most recent figures available. November 2008, for Canadian trade with U.S. from iron and steel mills, targeted, as we know, in the house of representatives bill and targeted, as well, in the senate bill, they will go into conference but one can assume that iron and steel will get through that conference and we will have to contend with this and deal with the administration, the American senate and congress, in a meaningful way.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269536">In November 2008, we exported $349 million worth of iron and steel to the U.S. and imported $401 million from the United States. In other words, the U.S. has a trade deficit with us in iron and steel. That essentially means that we buy more iron and steel from it than it buys from us. In November 2008, that is, essentially, what those figures mean. What that means is that we have an opportunity for a win-win. We have an opportunity to go to American senators and members of congress and say that we would like to exempt them from a “buy Canada” clause so we can use American iron and steel and we would like them to do the same with the “buy America” clause.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269537">There is just one tiny wrinkle in that. Over the last 20 years of Liberal inaction and Conservative inaction, and their lack of industrial strategies, neither government chose at any time to put in place a “buy Canada” clause. That is something the NDP has been pushing for, which is why there are more New Democrats in this House as we go through each election and why we overflow from one side to the other side of this House. Canadians want to know why the Liberals did not bring this in and why the Conservatives are not bringing in a 'buy Canada' clause. They will simply say that it must be illegal or that it is not in keeping with their textbook theory. However, the reality is that this would provide us with the leverage we need to sit down with the American administration and have a win-win negotiation by exempting our iron and steel in the same way that we would exempt theirs.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269538">I come to the third part of the motion which states, “urge the United States to respect its international agreements”.

On January 27 we tabled our economic action plan, a plan to stimulate economic growth, restore confidence and support Canadians and their families during this synchronized global recession. The action plan will stimulate the economy by building infrastructure, reducing taxes, freezing EI rates, stimulating housing construction, improving access to financing and strengthening Canada's financial system by helping Canadians through training programs.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269639">Just as our economic action plan is meant to provide stimulus in Canada, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 is predominantly meant to stimulate the U.S. economy.

In addition, the members of the board's international advocacy group were already considering what the chamber wants to say on this stimulus legislation to the Florida representatives in the U.S. Congress.

One U.S. economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics has concluded that buy American provisions in the bill will cost more jobs than it will create. Most of us are in agreement with that. Earlier this week President Obama spoke out about the need to avoid sending a protectionist message when trying to stimulate the economy and about the need to make sure that the provisions in the legislation will not trigger a trade war. Again, I think the Americans have come full circle on this. </ParaText>

The decision is yet to be made, so it is no time at all to give up on a full court press. It is no time to slacken the pressure that we are exerting on our American friends and colleagues. In many different arenas, in academia, in industry, in business and diplomatically, we have pursued this with great zeal on behalf of the citizens of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269664">I would like to thank the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128638" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation> for this timely motion. It is an important debate. It is a debate that needed to be had. It has allowed all of us in the House to clarify our position vis-à-vis whether we are going to move in a protectionist direction, join the downward spiral of nations that would destroy the economy of Canada and potentially of North America, or if we are going to stick to our formula that has worked for more than the past decade of rules-based trading that is fair and equitable to all of the players, that allows everyone in every economy to join with their allies, whether they be across the American border, the Mexican border, the Colombian border, the Costa Rican border or the Peruvian border. </ParaText>

I also want to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="128638" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation> for bringing forward this important motion and making it a subject of debate here in the House and across the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269690">The motion itself, if ordinary Canadians read it, might seem technical, but for ordinary Canadians or ordinary Labradorians who are involved in industries impacted by the legislation or the economic stimulus package in the United States, it is about their jobs, it is about how they are going to pay their bills. While it may seem technical to them, it hits home for many people.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269691">Our trading relationship with the United States is very important and it has to be based on mutual respect and on the rules. The riding of <Affiliation DbId="128757" Type="2">Labrador</Affiliation> has a very direct role in the Canadian and international iron and steel industry. Our iron ore industry has a longstanding close relationship with Canadian and American steel industries, having been developed by North American steel makers in the 1950s and 1960s.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269692">Iron ore production in Labrador in 2008 was estimated at $2.5 billion, no small chunk of change. We have two of the three most important iron ore producers in Canada, those being Wabush Mines, the Iron Ore Company of Canada and the other being Quebec Cartier, neighbouring us in northern Quebec out of Fermont.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269693">We also have a number of new iron ore projects in the advanced exploration at the pre-development stage. I will mention just a couple, those with the New Millennium group and the ironsands project. Up until a few years ago, iron ore represented over 90% of the mineral production in the entire province of Newfoundland and Labrador, and that was before Voisey's Bay nickel came on stream.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269694">Labrador now represents 98% of the mining industry in our province. Nickel production at Voisey's Bay last year is estimated at $2.2 billion, with over half a billion dollars more in related copper and cobalt production from the same mine. Nickel of course is a component in many types of steel as well as iron ore. Among the three operating mines in Labrador, Wabush, the Iron Ore Company of Canada and Voisey's Bay, they account for nearly 10% of the value of all Canadian mining in 2006.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269695">In the past several years they have generated tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars in royalties which are paid to the provincial government. In certain instances a share of those revenues are transferred to the Nunatsiavut government, the Labrador Inuit self-governing body, and the Innu nation representing the Innu people of Newfoundland and Labrador.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269696">It is not hard to see from these facts that the economy of my riding of <Affiliation DbId="128757" Type="2">Labrador</Affiliation> is very closely tied in with the Canadian international iron and steel industries. We have a direct interest in the domestic and international policies and politics that have an impact on this vital sector.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269697">Along with many other Canadians I was fascinated to watch the recent American election unfold and to see President Obama inaugurated just a few weeks ago. When the American stimulus package was drawn up, it included the problematic buy American clause. I and many in my riding were immediately concerned about the impact on the industries that were situated there which our economy was dependent upon.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269698">It seems that many on this side of the aisle and indeed throughout Canada, the U.S. and around the world share that concern. In the past few days and hours the president has signalled that he is open to measures to avert what could be an unfortunate international trade dispute, not just with Canada, but with other countries.</ParaText>

In western Labrador, we have already seen a number of projects deferred or cancelled, the announcement of 160 layoffs at Wabush Mines and scheduled shutdowns that will contribute to the hurt.

I will speak slow and low and hope my voice lasts the 10 minutes. </ParaText><ParaText id="1269717">The motion really calls upon the government to intervene forthwith and persistently with the United States administration and the congress in order to protect Canadian jobs. Simply put, what the motion really means to those opposite is that the Conservative government must wake up. The U.S. is becoming more protectionist and the government needs to be on top of this file. It needs to stand up for Canadians, not be asleep at the switch. </ParaText><ParaText id="1269718">This motion has become necessary simply because the United States, at the height of a global downturn, is looking inward and is becoming more protectionist. We saw back in the dirty thirties what happens when we have an economic downturn, or did not see, as my hon. colleague is laughing over there, or read about it in a history book. We know history and when we add an economic downturn and protectionist policies that basically seize up trading relationships between nations, then that makes matters even worse for all countries globally involved.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269719">Therefore, on the one hand, we have the U.S. becoming more protectionist, and on the other, the fact that the Conservative government seems to be asleep at the switch. Worse than that, the government record on this issue has been very poor. We know where it was on the softwood lumber dispute where the U.S. basically took the government to the cleaners. Canadians who work in the forestry industry and in the lumber plants, whether it is eastern Canada or western Canada, have suffered ever since.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269720">Canada is a trading nation. In fact, we are more dependent on trade than almost any other nation in the world and we are very dependent on the United States market. I see the <Affiliation DbId="111568" Type="96">Minister of Agriculture</Affiliation> is here and he will know that no industry is more dependent upon that trade than the agricultural industry, for which I am agriculture critic for the official opposition. </ParaText><ParaText id="1269721">Sixty per cent of our hogs are exported, not all of them to the United States but we are greatly dependent on that market. Fifty per cent of our beef is exported and an even higher percentage of wheat, but the wheat industry is not as dependent on the United States market as it is around the rest of the world.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269722">Trade is extremely important. Yes, we need to expand our relationships around the world. In fact, I believe the minister made an announcement the other day in opening up an additional market for beef, and that is good, but the fact is that the U.S. is our closest trading partner. It is our neighbour and our friend most times and we will always be extremely dependent upon that market, and that cuts both ways. Both countries gain extensively from that trading relationship.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269723">Farmers, though, perhaps more than most, can tell us the impact upon their livelihoods when all of a sudden the United States uses whatever levers or excuse it has and becomes protectionist. No industry, bar none, was as integrated as the Canada and United States livestock industries, up until five or six years ago when we exported feeders to the United States and brought up slaughter cattle from the U.S., but then we had a situation where we had one cow with a case of BSE and immediately the border was closed.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1269724">As a result of that border closing, in what I believe were protectionist measures taken by the cattle industry in the United States and supported by congress and the senate, cattle farmers in Canada today are still suffering even though the border is now open. Billions of dollars have been lost. As a result, the previous government and the present government had to pump considerable millions of dollars into the industry to support it in its time of need. Those are the consequences.We have seen first-hand in the cattle industry the consequences of measures taken that will bring in protectionist measures and isolate certain industries from trading relationships. </ParaText><ParaText id="1269725">We know very well that congress and the senate especially can be very protectionist and the government opposite should know that. However, the government seemed to be caught off guard, just like it was on the economy. We heard stories during the election that this country would not see a deficit next year. Now we know differently. Instead of being on the ball and paying attention to what was happening in the U.S., it seems to have been caught off guard as the U.S. Congress and Senate take more and more protectionist measures.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1269726">The purpose of this motion today is to push the Government of Canada to be more accountable, to take aggressive action with the United States, to send delegations to the United States from the ministerial level and to be on top of its counterparts in pushing the issue of good, open trade relationships between the two countries. </ParaText><ParaText id="1269727">When Ron Kirk was put forward as the United States' trade representative, he was quoted in a Reuters news service report saying:</ParaText><ParaText id="1269728"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The United States cannot afford to turn its back on trade as it tries to dig its way out of a deep recession, President-elect Barack Obama's choice to be U.S. trade representative said on Sunday. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1269729">He went on to say, talking to mayors:</ParaText><ParaText id="1269730"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">But I also know there are mayors in this room that represent communities that feel very differently about that, and part of our challenge as we go forward is to make sure we have a trade policy that basically makes sense to the American public. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>

His second point is that, yes, there are mayors, communities, congressmen and senators who feel differently about that, and that is where our government needs to be on the ball. It needs to be on the ball talking to people at the congressional level, senate level and administration level to enforce the point of how valuable that trading relationship is to both our countries.</ParaText><ParaText id="1269732">I am a member of the Canada-United States parliamentary association, as some members are on the other side. One of our members, a co-chair, Senator Grafstein, has been to the United States several times in the last few weeks. In my view, he, as one senator, has been more aggressively pushing the fact and informing Americans on how serious these trade protectionist measures they are taking could be. I ask the government to catch up to the senator in terms of being aggressive and protecting Canadian interests, building understanding in the United States that this trade relationship is important to both our countries and pushing them to cease and desist on the protectionist measures that will undermine both our economies and livelihoods into the future.</ParaText>

I had wondered why the Liberals were going ahead with their motion, because Mr. Obama had announced that the United States would comply with WTO rules and international standards. But I soon realized that the motion was still relevant because it says that “this House calls upon the Government to intervene forthwith and persistently” and urge the United States to respect the trade agreements between it and Canada, the North American Free Trade Agreement and the World Trade Organization. The Liberals realized that Canada might have to go to court, whereas now we can take diplomatic action. We saw this in the softwood lumber sector.

I am pleased to have a chance to speak to this issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270013">The motion we are debating, which the Bloc Québécois will support, reflects the urgency and gravity of the current situation. The protectionist measures in the American recovery package could have a serious impact on Quebec's economy and undermine trade agreements between the United States and its partners. The Bloc Québécois believes that the House must take a strong stand and give the government a mandate to press our case immediately and tirelessly with American authorities. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270014"> Although President Obama seems to have backed down on certain parts of the Buy American Act, the protectionist measures proposed by the United States may contain provisions to sidestep international trade agreements, such as NAFTA. For example, one clause in the Buy American Act imposes restrictions on the use of steel and steel by-products in American construction projects. Most highway infrastructure work is funded by the Federal Highway Administration, and we know that there is a big difference between the projects it funds and the direct purchases it makes. The projects it funds are subject to the Buy American Act provisions, while direct purchases are subject to NAFTA.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270015">In practice, this distinction means that chapter 10 of NAFTA will not apply to the 80% of U.S. highway construction projects that are considered funded , and that Quebec and Canadian companies will not be entitled to the same treatment as American companies. State-level projects are not subject to NAFTA and must comply with the Buy American Act. With respect to steel, the American recovery plan has tightened the rules to make it practically impossible for Quebec companies to bid on projects. This matter is serious because the requirement to use American-sourced metal now includes all public infrastructure construction, alteration, renovation, maintenance and repair projects.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270016">It is clear that these measures could do a lot of damage in Quebec. Our economy is very closely linked to that of the United States.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I will learn.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270021">As I was saying, it is obvious that these measures could be devastating for Quebec. Our economy is closely linked with that of the United States, which accounts for 57% of Quebec's exports when interprovincial trade is factored in.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270022">In terms of international exports alone, that figure rises to 85%. Quebec has a large surplus due to its trade with the United States. In fact, Quebec sells twice as much to Americans as it buys from them. In this context, it is clear that Quebec wants trade with the United States to be as flexible as possible. A trade war, or even partially opting out of NAFTA, would not be beneficial for Quebec. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270023">Free trade is part of the Bloc Québécois philosophy as long as the agreements are well regulated and monitored. Contrary to what the Conservatives and Liberals are suggesting, which is that Canada join in the mad dash to implement bilateral trade agreements, the Bloc Québécois is questioning the nature and the long-term impact of these agreements. It is imperative to us that, prior to signing an agreement, we take the time to evaluate the positives and negatives of the agreement for our economy.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270024">We believe that in order for trade to be mutually beneficial, it must first be fair. A trading system that results in the exploitation of poor countries and dumping in rich countries is not viable. We cannot accept a system of free trade that would be based on the lowest common denominator. For that reason we find it difficult to understand why this government insists on signing and moving forward on the free trade agreement with Colombia in particular.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270025">We believe that multilateral negotiations are much more advantageous for everyone. They are better monitored and generally more effective. The liberalization movement that has taken place in the world in recent years now needs to be given a more human dimension. The problem in our mind with these bilateral agreements is that they do not allow us to apply rules to civilize trade.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270026">Most of these agreements do not contain clauses on human rights, labour rights or the environment. We believe that the government should perhaps sign better agreements rather than signing a large series of agreements that do not reflect our concerns.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270027">In this regard, the Bloc Québécois is urging the federal government to revise its positions in trade negotiations in order to ensure that trade agreements include clauses ensuring compliance with international labour standards as well as respect for human rights and the environment.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270028">In the end, we must continue to move forward, to improve our agreements and to increase the chances of prosperity for all. Therefore, we cannot understand why the new American administration is seeking to adopt measures that forsake our mutual commitments. This reminds us of the attitude of the previous administration which, in 2001, resorted to section 203 of the 1974 Trade Act in order to impose customs duties and a licensing system on steel imports for a period of three years. Under considerable pressure from industry representatives in Canada and Mexico, the United States decided to exempt these two NAFTA trading partners from these measures.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270029">Nonetheless, this sparked considerable irritation throughout the entire world, and the United States was harshly criticized for this unilateral move. In the situation concerning us now, perhaps we can be made an exception to the rule once again. But the message that has already been sent should caution us against possible protectionist measures and encourage us to protect our own industries better.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="25">(1525)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1270030">The difficulties Quebec has seen in recent years prompted us to change our trade priorities. Last year, the rise in the Canadian dollar, driven by Alberta oil exports, reduced the competitiveness of Quebec businesses on the American market, while emerging countries were dominating the global market.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270031">In this context of a deteriorating trade environment, the Bloc Québécois made accessing foreign markets our top trade priority. I would also like to point out that the Bloc is proposing important measures regarding international trade, while always keeping in mind the need for balance and healthy competition when it comes to trade.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270032">To close, the Bloc Québécois supports the motion before us today.

One of the responsibilities of the Conservative government and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is to ensure that both the American president and the American politicians understand this reality. Our economies are intertwined and we have no interest, none of us, in having protectionist measures such as those contained in the stimulus plan that was presented to and passed by the House of Representatives. There is also the discussion that is taking place in the Senate. We know that Senator McCain's amendment was defeated, and so we find ourselves back at square one. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270047">I do not need to talk about the close ties between the Quebec, Canadian and American economies. My colleagues—the member for <Affiliation DbId="128135" Type="2">Sherbrooke</Affiliation> in particular—covered that. However, it is important to remember that, for Quebec in particular, this trade is extremely important. Today we find ourselves in a situation where, because of Quebec's dependence on oil—which is true for the rest of Canada as well, but since Canada exports oil to the United States, it is not as obvious as in Quebec's case, since we do not produce or export oil—Quebec's trade balance, whether in terms of foreign partners or Canadian provinces, is currently running a deficit of $7 to $8 billion.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270048">I mentioned earlier that this dependence on oil was important because it is one of the significant causes of this trade deficit. We know that our oil imports in Quebec represent nearly $6 to $7 billion, which explains a large part of the trade deficit.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270049">Obviously, where the advantage lies is with our American partners. In fact, we in Quebec have a trade surplus with the United States of around $5 billion. If protectionist policies became the norm in the U.S., we would have an even worse problem. In fact, we already have a problem in terms of trade which is, as I have said, related to our oil dependency, but also to the fact that, for some years, the Canadian dollar was inflated, by oil exports from Alberta to the United States in particular. This inflated dollar did a considerable amount of harm to the competitive ability of manufacturers, particularly those in Quebec, but the same is true for Ontario. We amuse ourselves by repeating this, though it is far from amusing: even the government ought to have twigged to that as early as 2007.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270050">I like saying—and again not because it is amusing, but rather because it illustrates the extent to which the government was asleep at the switch—that in the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>'s economic statement in October 2007, on page 28, there was a lovely table showing that all industrial sectors had been declining since 2005, with the exception of oil and hydrocarbons. So steps should have been taken as early as 2007, even 2006, to help the manufacturing sector. There was a refusal to take such actions, and unfortunately the budget of last week continues that tradition. Once again, there is significant aid to the automotive sector, in the form of loan guarantees, but nothing for the forestry sector and nothing, or next to nothing, for aerospace. When we think, for instance, of the $170 million over two years for all of Canada, including Quebec, for the forestry crisis, we can see that this is pretty puny as support goes. Annually, it works out to about $10 to $20 million for Quebec. That is clearly inadequate, particularly since Quebec is there the forestry crisis has hit the hardest. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270051">It is extremely important to us for the Conservative government, the Government of Canada, to set this campaign of persuasion against protectionism as its number one priority. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="40">(1540)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1270052">We in the Bloc Québécois hope that this protection issue, which is at risk of pitting Canada against the United States, can be solved by diplomatic means, rather than through the courts.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270053">I must say that I was somewhat surprised. When it is a matter of diplomacy, we feel that things have to go beyond a phone call from the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to the American President—and we do not know if that call has even been made—to tell him that one of the provisions in his legislation poses a serious problem for us, and we think that it is in neither his interests or our own for that provision to be maintained. One expects the government and the Prime Minister to be extremely active on the diplomatic level. Yet we learn from a Canadian Press report that the Prime Minister of Canada called Mexican President Felipe Caldéron yesterday evening, that is on February 4. Mexico is one of the three partners in NAFTA. One of the agreements seems not to be respected by the House of Representative provisions, and it is currently under discussion in the Senate. That agreement seems to be at cross purposes with NAFTA, according to nearly all Canadian and Quebec experts. One might have thought that the Prime Minister would have been on the phone to the Mexican President as soon as the American intentions were made public, with a proposal that they join forces against this rise in U.S. protectionism. But no, it took the Prime Minister somewhere between 10 days and 2 weeks to make the call to the president of Mexico, one of the three partners in NAFTA.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270054">I seriously wonder what the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Conservative government have done to try to coordinate their actions with the Europeans. We need to remember that under the provision of the bill, which is currently before the Senate and was passed by the House of Representatives, this protectionist measure will apply not just to Canadian steel, but to all manufactured products, wherever they come from. So the Europeans, like us, have a vested interest in seeing the protectionist approach in President Obama's recovery plan disappear.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270055">We have no evidence that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> took the initiative to get on the phone and secure the European Union's support. Reference has been made to the World Trade Organization rules. That may be a less direct route than NAFTA, but there are provisions to prevent the use of protectionist measures. For example, I am thinking of the clause providing for reciprocity between WTO trading partners. If Canada agrees to allow American steel into our country, then the Americans have to agree to let in our steel.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270056">These provisions must be used, not aggressively, but simply to tell the American President and American politicians that rules were created in times of economic growth to address problems during times of difficulty or crisis. Trading partners must not take the first opportunity to abandon the rules they created to manage crises, because we are in a crisis. I wholeheartedly share the opinion of the movers of the Liberal motion. Everyone knows that a rise in protectionism will only exacerbate and prolong the economic slowdown. We need to learn from the 1930s. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270057">In closing, I want to remind this House that in the United States at present, and particularly with the new Democratic administration, there is an awareness of international trade and globalization that, unfortunately, the Conservative government does not have. I am thinking of all those measures that are needed to create a balance between healthy competition and a certain number of rights.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1270058">That may be the crux of the problem in the United States. Like many Quebeckers and Canadians and workers around the world, they felt that freer trade in recent decades benefited only people with capital and was not in workers' interests. And that has to be corrected. Unfortunately, that feeling is not reflected on the other side of the House.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

In case there is someone who does not know exactly what the motion is, I would like to read it:</ParaText><ParaText id="1270074"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That, in view of the growing protectionism in the United States, which is reminiscent of the counterproductive behaviour that led to the great depression of the 1930s, this House calls upon the Government to intervene forthwith and persistently, with the United States Administration, and the Congress, in order to protect Canadian jobs, and urge the United States to respect its international agreements including the Canada-United States Trade Agreement (CUSTA), the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the World Trade Organisation (WTO).</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1270075">It is hard to imagine that the U.S. would violate those agreements. We are certainly hoping the Americans are not going to do that, but it is important that the appropriate pressure be put on them to make sure they understand the implications.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270076">Through this motion the opposition seeks to hold the government accountable for what we see as its failure to secure our relationship with our most important trading partner, the United States, on a better footing than it is today.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270077">Just as the Conservative government dropped the ball when it came to addressing the state of our economy, we feel it has not played an active enough role in shaping decisions with our trading partners.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270078">The Conservative government has let the Canada-U.S. trade relationship deteriorate, allowing major U.S. legislation to threaten key Canadian industries and jobs. The government's mishandling of the financial crisis and its delay in bringing forward a stimulus package has meant that Canada missed out on the opportunity to coordinate our response to the economic crisis with that of our largest trading partner. This failure has us scrambling to reach U.S. legislators now and to try to overturn existing legislation when we should have been promoting Canada's interest and leading the development of Canada-U.S. trade policy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270079">Behind every international trade statistic are relationships. Clearly, the Government of Canada and all parliamentarians have been working on building those relationships through a variety of different sources, including our Canada-U.S. Inter-Parliamentary Group.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270080">It should come as no surprise that the U.S. Congress leans toward putting up barriers to trade in a time of economic crisis. The Conservative government continues to be caught off guard by U.S. legislators reacting to the U.S. agenda rather than advancing our own.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270081">The total absence of a considered strategic approach to Canada-U.S. relations has helped to bring us to the brink of this trade issue, and will continue to hinder the Conservative government's ability to hold sway on other matters of critical importance, such as border security, climate change, the auto sector and the list goes on.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270082">I welcomed last night's agreement by U.S. senators to change the protectionist provision inserted into the U.S. government's economic stimulus bill with the addition of a crucial clause that the bill be applied in a manner consistent with U.S. obligations under international agreements.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270083">On the surface it certainly makes us feel better that the Americans have recognized the issue. I am pleased that the Americans have recognized that they should not enact laws that contravene their commitments to liberalized trading regimes under WTO and the North American free trade agreement, but we are not out of the water yet. Very quickly after the announcement of that motion, some experts relayed concerns that cities and states could be exempt from these restrictions, and it could still hurt both of our ailing economies.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270084">Canadians can rest assured that we will monitor the situation very carefully and make sure that the Conservatives keep up the pressure on the United States. That is why it is so important for us to maintain a positive relationship with our largest trading partner. A strained relationship with the United States surely led to this major worry that such restrictions would spark a trade war and exasperate the economic downturn.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270085">We have a special relationship with the United States, a unique partnership with a long and colourful history where we always try to be respectful of distinct jurisdictions, principles and values.</ParaText>

We have had many meetings with congressmen, senators and representatives on the issues that bring us together as well as the issues that have given us huge problems, such as the border. On many of those issues we have been able to work them out through our relationship.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270087">It is the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s job to make our trade relationship with the United States a priority. I feel he has failed to do this to date.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270088">The Liberal government had a strong record of cooperation with the United States. I would like to remind members and inform new members that former prime minister Paul Martin was so concerned about the relationship between Canada and the United States that he had a parliamentary secretary dedicated strictly to Canada-U.S. relations. In fact, it was the very member for <Affiliation DbId="128638" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation> whose motion we are debating today. It was a huge help to the government at that time, and it might be a great opportunity for the current government to look at that very issue of having a parliamentary secretary working on those relationships.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270089">The Conservatives have failed Canadians before through their misguided actions with regard to trade. Think of the softwood lumber fiasco, for example. Members will remember that the proposal put forward by the Conservative government abandoned Canada's position. It was pursued by successive Canadian governments and upheld by trade panels at both NAFTA and the WTO that our softwood industry is not subsidized.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270090">Putting that aside, it is imperative that we work together to protect the jobs in both countries. We have so many industries that are intertwined, such as our auto industry, our steel industry, and too many more to list. Preventing trade would clearly be contrary to the North American free trade agreement. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270091">I am pleased to hear that the Bloc understands the issues and will be supporting the motion. I hope that the NDP will realize the outdated ideology it is functioning under and support this motion as well. It would be very important for the U.S. government to see that this motion has unanimous support and that we are all very concerned and want to work with the U.S. to solve these issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270092">For example, the exclusion of non-U.S. steel would violate NAFTA which lowered trade barriers among the U.S., Canada and Mexico. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270093">The Conservative government must end its politics of division and look to the Liberals and other parties in the House for a good example of how we can work together with our southern neighbours on important issues. We just heard the government whip make some great comments about parliamentarians working together and respecting each other, and I hope that will continue, especially through difficult times.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270094">There is a unique relationship between Canada and the United States.

If we look at the auto industry, it is not a single industry for the United States or for us; it is an industry that is very much integrated. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270100">It is up to us to be that strong voice.

Granted, these are unique times and the U.S. is acting out of fear and so on, but part of the Conservative government's role more so than anyone else's is to make sure its ears are to the ground.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270106">In respect to the so-called coalition issue, there was no discussion about anyone who was going to violate the NAFTA agreement or any other agreement.

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Fry" id="2586906"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128515" Type="2">Hon. Hedy Fry (Vancouver Centre, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1270107"> Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak to the motion presented by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128638" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation>. At the heart of the motion is the fact that, under the Conservative government, a long-standing relationship with the United States has been deteriorating, not just slowly but rapidly deteriorating.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270108">We are a trading nation. Canada depends for 45% of its gross domestic product on trade, 80% of that trade is carried out with the United States, our neighbour to the south. That country has been our ally. We have disagreed, but we have always had a strong relationship. By a strong relationship, I do not mean that we stand there and pound our fists. I mean it is a relationship based on mutual respect.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270109">To create a relationship, we need to have ongoing and open lines of communication. We have to keep the relationship going. We have to continue talking. We have to continue building on the things that we share and stand firm on the things that we do not share.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270110">That was the nature of the relationship, at least under the Liberal government, for 13 years before the Conservative government came into power. The problem is that relationship no longer exists.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270111">The current relationship between Canada and the United States is typified by two descriptors: one is fawning or subservient and the other is reactive. The government either reacts to something that it obviously is not aware is coming down the pipe, or it bows its head and meekly does what it is told to do, at times when it needs to, and I will elaborate on these a little later.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270112">However, I want to talk a little about the fact that the reactivity is what is of great concern to us. If we have open lines of communication and if we maintain a strong relationship, we are friends. We talk to each other. We do not necessarily agree, but at least we know what is coming down the pipe. Even if we were not forewarned in certain conversations that we kept between us as two sovereign nations, one should just look at history and tradition.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270113">During the Great Depression, and in the dirty thirties as it was called, we saw how the United States reacted at that time to a depression. It began to be protectionist. This is the nature of any country, when it is faced with stress, to behave in certain patterns. We should have known those patterns. The reaction to stress by the United States is to immediately crawl in and become protectionist. Therefore, we should have seen it coming down the pipe for two reasons: first, because of tradition and history under stress; and second, because we also had lines of communication open.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270114">Therefore, the government has a failing mark on both of those, on reading the history or on being able to have open lines of communication. Now what we have is reactivity.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270115">Thank goodness for a new president whose administration is one that has decided that it would rather make friends and do the right thing, rather than continue to be strong and pound the table along with other people. We have seen this happen.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270116">President Obama said that he did not want to harm trade relationships with the world. Worldwide trade relationships will be harmed if the Americans resort to protectionism. We saw that happen after the Great Depression when the world trading relationships began to fall apart after the protectionism by the United States.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270117">Here we have something that we could have headed off at the pass without needing to have the President of the United States to turn around and say, “Oops, I'm sorry”. We could have headed that off. In good relationships we do not paint our friends in a corner and have them having to bow out and say, “I'm sorry, I didn't think about that earlier on”. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270118">However, what does it say, when we, as the nearest neighbour, supposedly a country with strong relationships, allies sharing the longest unprotected border in the world, did not know that we were on the agenda. It means we are not even on the radar with the United States. We used to be on the radar. A good example was when President Clinton came to visit. He came to the House. He spoke to the House. He spoke to the senate. We welcomed him.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270119">President Bush came here. He also came and spoke to everyone and was welcomed. We differ on certain occasions, but we maintain that friendship and the ability to lobby and to talk to each other. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1270120">It is not by chance that members of Parliament are able to use their flying points to go to Washington, D.C. because we must continue to keep those lines open. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270121">The government has failed on that. The lines are closed. No one knows what is happening. The result, as we have seen with the recession, was too little too late. The government pretends things are not happening. It is always in denial. When things fall apart at the seams, government members suddenly leap into the air yelling and screaming and wonder what to do next. That is the pattern of the Conservative government. We should not have been surprised that this occurred.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270122">I want to also talk about the other part of the relationship which we seem to have developed with the United States. It is not one of a strong partner with mutual respect for each other. It is a subservient kind of relationship, and I go back to the softwood lumber deal because it is something that we must bring to the table as an example of how we are either reactive or subservient.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270123">The relationship between the two countries has always been based on mutual respect and a strong sense that we understood each other. Canada would do what it thought was best and the United States would do what it thought was best, but we totally respected each other. That is gone. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270124">The Liberals made a strong deal with the United States when we negotiated an agreement on softwood lumber. The Conservative government came into power and agreed to a deal that left $1 billion, on the table, money that the Liberal government had negotiated, to go back to the U.S. The Conservatives also made an agreement that increased the tariffs under certain conditions. It was a bad deal.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270125">A legal analysis commissioned by the Free Trade Lumber Council and two Ontario associations had this to say, “We are sharply critical of the April 27th package which is a political bargain forsaking entirely the rule of law enshrined in the North American free trade agreement. It was something that was a political deal brokered between the administration of [the Prime Minister] and George Bush”.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270126">Political deals were made that were not in the best interests of Canada at all. We lost a great deal at the table. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270127">Here is what we also heard from people in the mill industry in British Columbia:</ParaText><ParaText id="1270128"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">They had phone calls at the mill level from Conservative MPs and they were told very clearly, “If you don't support this, don't count on the federal government for helping you with your difficulties later on”.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1270129">We had a political deal based on subservience, brokered just to allow for good relationships to continue. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270130">I used to be a negotiator for doctors in the province of British Columbia. One cannot negotiate from a position of weakness, but must negotiate from a position of strength. There has to be mutual respect at the table if a deal is going to be brokered that is a win-win situation on both sides.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270131">Now we see a new administration in the United States, an administration that seems to be a polar opposite to the current Conservative government. It is sad because there seems to be little in common. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270132">The President of the United States believes in science. He listens to what others tell him. He is not ideological. He is bringing back things like stem cell research and talking about funding groups that are non-advocates and do not necessarily agree with him, but funding them nonetheless. He is going back to dealing with things based on knowledge and information and outcomes and what works. The Conservative government is based on ideology and ideology alone.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270133">I worry for our future relationship with the United States. I worry that this deteriorating relationship is going to slide downhill very rapidly when the intelligent and modern day thinking President of the United States listens to what we have here, which is a retrogressive, ideological government. He can find nothing in common with us.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270134">I hope for the sake of Canadians and all our industries that this never happens.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

							<ParaText id="1270241">We need continued action from the government. We need it to be proactive and not, as it is in this case, reactive. We on this side of this House recognize that it is hesitant to do so, as it has been hesitant with every major economic decision since the start of the crisis. However, it is time to be vigilant and to be unafraid to assert our position in advance of protectionist measures. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270242">In the words of the great thinker Søren Kierkegaard:</ParaText><ParaText id="1270243"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">It is perfectly true, as philosophers say, that life must be understood backwards.

Canadian livelihoods are at stake, as are the values of our natural resources and our partnerships with the United States. However, it is not simply enough to act now on information we have had for 70-odd years. We must act now to prevent this sort of reaction from occurring in the future. With the dawn of a new administration in the United States, Canada must act to establish the sort of relationship with the United States through which our position will be well known and clear in advance of any protectionist measures.</ParaText>

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Holland" id="2587605"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128199" Type="2">Mr. Mark Holland (Ajax—Pickering, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1270260">Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to speak to this important motion introduced by the <Affiliation DbId="128638" Type="2">member for Kings—Hants</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270261">We only need to look at history to prove without a doubt that there is a tremendous cost to protectionism. When we look at the last time the world and certainly North America faced a tremendous economic challenge of this magnitude, it was just after the stock market crash in 1929. The U.S. responded with a series of protectionist measures which had a huge detrimental impact, and which many would argue created the Great Depression.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270262">Today there is a similar lure of protectionism, an oversimplified argument that if we just insulate ourselves and trade among ourselves and close the doors and batten down the hatches an international storm will pass us by. Protectionism is once again luring certain elements within the U.S. Congress. Unfortunately Congress has a long tradition of protectionism, particularly when times get tough. One would expect that the Conservative government would have been right on top of this, that the government would have, at the earliest opportunity, as soon as the president was sworn in, or much before that, anticipated that that would have been the response, but unfortunately that was far from the case.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270263"> What we traded was the Conservatives' idolization of Republicans that had them fearing criticizing Republicans because of the tremendous honour and esteem in which they held them. That has been replaced now with a complete lack of contacts with the Democrats. The result of that is that Canada, in both situations, has been left unprotected and our interests largely undefended.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270264"> I want to speak about the buy American clause. The developments that came out of the U.S. Senate and supported by President Obama are very encouraging. That there is now going to be respect for foreign trade agreements is good, but we cannot drop our vigilance. The reality is that the protectionist forces are very large and the Conservative government has not been effective to this point in time. The government has failed to advance our interests and to ensure that this whole debacle did not happen in the first place. It is very easy for very loosely worded language to develop into something far more concerning.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270265">As our party's critic for public safety and national security, I want to speak of a secondary threat to trade between Canada and the U.S. that is non-tariff based and that could potentially have an even bigger detrimental impact. I am concerned that the government has largely been silent on the security issues and how those issues have created massive barriers to trade. In particular, Secretary Napolitano, on January 30, 2009, ordered a comprehensive review of U.S. vulnerabilities along the northern border with recommendations as to what could be done to strengthen it. In her statement, she said:</ParaText><ParaText id="1270266"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">What are the current vulnerabilities, the overall strategy for reducing those vulnerabilities, the requirements, the programs, the budget, and the timeframe for improving security along this border and what level of risk will remain once programs are completed?</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1270267">Her announcement was accompanied by a very remarkable statement, one which greatly concerns me. She said that the effect that a terrorist threat had on the Canada-U.S. border was greater than on the U.S.-Mexico border. This is a dramatic shift. I do not think we have ever heard that kind of language used before. Once again there is talk in the United States of the terrorism in Canada and the great threat on the border. This has a profound implication for our ability to move goods and services. It has prompted some U.S. newspaper editorials to call the northern border “America's weakest link: an easy entry point from which to launch an attack on U.S. soil”. That was in <I>The Washington Times</I> on January 29.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270268">Talk like this is detrimental to Canada-U.S. relations on trade and continental security, and it is further made worse by the laissez faire attitude taken by the Conservative government. It is hard to know exactly why the U.S. has turned its spotlight on the northern border, especially considering its more habitual focus on the south. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270269">As Martin Collacott, a senior fellow at the Fraser Institute and former Canadian ambassador, wrote in an article that appeared in the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I> yesterday, Secretary Napolitano's “decision reflects to some extent the interests of protectionist elements in the United States prepared to use security measures as a means of slowing down the movement of imports from Canada into the United States”.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1270270">One would expect with a statement as concerning as that, that the government would act swiftly, that it would speak out and ensure that Canadian interests were protected and that the American government understood that this sort of talk was simply misguided and frankly a little ridiculous.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270271">The reality though is that the government did nothing. The response has been complete silence. It is almost as if the government is ambivalent to the issue, yet the report which is to be tabled is going to be done so on February 17, just a few weeks from now, immediately before the meeting the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> will have with President Obama. The presentation that will be made by Secretary Napolitano, the statement of where the Americans are going with security on the border between Canada and the U.S. will have profound implications for Canada-U.S. relations and for trade, and we are completely missing in action. It is unclear what the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> will even do to react once the statement actually is made.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270272"> I would certainly submit that while we are considering protectionism in the form of this buy American clause, we should also similarly expect the government to be speaking out on issues of security and the free movement of goods and services across our border.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270273">I would also like to speak about the western hemisphere travel initiative. This is another area of great disappointment for me. The reality of the implementation of the western hemisphere travel initiative is to see the tourism dollars in Canada reduced by some $2 billion since it has been brought into force and effect.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270274">The requirement for citizens of the United States to have a passport to enter Canada has been severely detrimental. In point of fact, only about one-quarter of U.S. citizens hold a valid U.S. passport. It makes it very difficult for them. If normally they would go into Canada for a day or a couple of days, if they have to get a passport beforehand, and some 75% of Americans do not have one, they are making a decision not to go to Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270275">Where has the Canadian government been on this issue? Again it has been almost completely silent. While a number of northern U.S. governors, senators and congressmen have been recognizing that their states have been adversely impacted, while they were expecting to have more cooperation from the Canadian government, they have been deeply disappointed by the lack of voice and the lack of courage of action by the Canadian government. That is an area too on which we desperately need to act, especially when we consider that some 300,000 people cross the border every day.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270276">Trade in the context of our country is so greatly impacted by what happens with the United States. In fact, east-west trade is far less than north-south trade. Protectionism and lack of action by the government to deal with the security issues that I have just talked about puts in jeopardy bilateral trade of some $577 billion a year. That is about $1.6 billion each and every day in goods and services that cross the border.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270277">If we are going to ensure the vitality of our trading relationship, indeed if we are going to ensure the strength of our economy, we need to have far more action by the government than it has taken to date. Simply being reactionary is unacceptable. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270278">I commend the member for <Affiliation DbId="128638" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation> for bringing forward this motion, allowing me and members of this House the opportunity to talk about this important issue and to put pressure on the government to take action.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1270279">Madam Speaker, I would like to mention three general areas and one specific point in which Canada can take a much greater role but in which the government has been found wanting . The first is energy security. The second is the environmental crisis. The third is security in general. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270280">Does the member not feel that Canada and the United States could do a much better job of engaging in integrating into a trans-border energy grid that would benefit both of our countries?</ParaText><ParaText id="1270281">On the issue of security, this is still a huge challenge for the U.S. government as well as ours. President Obama has said that he is going to do things differently. He is going to start engaging with other countries and groups, particularly those in the Muslim world, and will try to talk to people who the previous U.S. administration had excluded. It is fundamentally important that our country start talking to people with whom we have not spoken before. Speaking with them does not condone what they have done, but excluding them certainly does not enable us to get to the table to resolve issues. </ParaText>

One of the greatest sources of pride Canadians have is that Canada is a force for balance and peace in the world. Canada traditionally has played a role and has been seen as an honest broker, an independent third party in things that are going on in the world. It uses its goodwill and the notion that it is not a satellite of any other power, to exert its force in a way that really punches above its weight. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270285">This has trade implications as well because at the end of the day, trade is all about the strength and force of our relationships. If we are not working on those relationships, if we are not demonstrating in meaningful ways that our first objective is to take a fair and balanced approach in how we deal with international affairs, we can greatly hurt our ability to trade effectively.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270286">The member also commented on energy security. I completely agree. I will not reiterate what he said other than to say that I agree.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270287">Lastly, with respect to the environmental crisis, we just heard today that the scant measures taken by the Conservative government, for example the transit credit, have resulted in absolutely no reductions. Yet again, it was placebo policy. The difference in this case is that it actually cost us a lot of money to get to nowhere. That might have been fine when the United States was so far behind in ignoring environmental issues, but now that there is an administration in the United States that puts the environment at the centre of its economic growth and development, we risk falling behind the Americans tremendously in allowing them to create the jobs of the future. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270288">If we thought that the Internet was a source for growth and new development in innovation, it is nothing compared to the post-carbon technologies that are going to come. We should not be allowing the Americans to develop that technology and those jobs.

When I sat down with GM which has its headquarters just to the east of my riding, its first issue was just-in-time delivery and the ability to get goods and services across the border. The hon. member is absolutely right that things have completely stalled. In fact, we have seen almost no progress in three years, almost a reversal. It is so much harder to get goods and services across the border.

The motion essentially urges our government to intervene with the American government in fighting attempts to build protectionist walls between our economies. I want to say that I have great news for the member for Kings—Hants.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270294">Our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and Conservative government are way out in front on this issue. We have actively been engaging the new American president and his officials in opposing protectionist measures. So, essentially, we are already doing what the motion asks our government to do. Which of course begs the question, why is this motion before the House? I can only speculate as to the political motives behind that.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270295">It is not surprising that our Conservative government would take the threat of protectionism so seriously. Over 75% of all of our trade is with the United States. Any attempts to put up artificial barriers in violation of the NAFTA would pose huge financial challenges for Canadians. That is why our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has acted so quickly in engaging the Americans on this issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270296">Just so Canadians understand how extensive our efforts have been in addressing the challenges facing our manufacturing industries, I would like to mention a few. As we know, the steel industry is petrified about the posturing of the American government concerning setting up new trade barriers; for example, its buy American proposal.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270297"> We understand that the Canadian steel industry is under intense pressure because these are very challenging times for employers and employees. Global economic conditions have deteriorated to the extent that the international monetary fund is forecasting a mere .5% world growth in 2009. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270298">However, there is also a broad worldwide consensus among economists that Canada will outperform all the other G7 countries. Why is that? There is an answer to that question. It is largely due to the measures taken previously by our Conservative government and the sound competitive financial system we have in place in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270299">Some of the measures that we have undertaken are as follows. We started off by reducing taxes. We started that program back in 2006, shortly after we were elected, and in each successive budget, we have reduced taxes to Canadians. In fact, the total value of the tax reductions is somewhere in the order of $200 billion over five years. That is perhaps the defining distinction between us and the opposition parties. When we ask Liberals in this House, they will say they would prefer to have their hands in taxpayers' pockets, and they actually have spoken openly against the tax reductions that we have incorporated into our economic action plan.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270300">We have also paid down the debt by $37 billion. Now there are some in the opposition benches who have suggested paying down $37 billion was squandering the taxpayers money. We believe it is a wise investment. It is what average Canadians do when they receive little extra money, they pay down their house mortgage. Somehow, that does not make sense to our opposition friends.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270301">Before I proceed, I want to state that I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="128123" Type="2">London West</Affiliation>,</ParaText><ParaText id="1270302">Another thing we have done is establish our “Advantage Canada” plan to make our economy more competitive in the global marketplace. We have given the Bank of Canada additional power to inject liquidity into our lending institutions. We have increased local, regional and national investments by accelerating our massive infrastructure program, the largest such investment ever in the history of our country.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270303">Finally, we have provided more financing for mortgages, and for car and business loans. This is to free up more credit so that our economy can get going again. That is not to say that we are out of the woods. The International Monetary Fund is forecasting negative growth for Canada in 2009. Canada, as well know, is not immune to this global economic situation.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1270304">Our government recognizes that the steel industry is a cornerstone industry in our modern economy. In this regard, Canada is no different. The presence of the steel industry has enabled other sectors of our economy to prosper and flourish, and among those industries are the auto industry, the construction industry, the pipe and tube industry, and the fabricated metal industry. All of these purchase steel that is further manufactured into finished goods.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270305">A number of my colleagues have already highlighted how important that steel industry is to Canada. Believe it or not, in 2007, the Canadian steel industry alone employed 30,000 people. It had revenues of a whopping $16.8 billion. The industry has major facilities in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270306">In 2007 the Canadian steel industry also exported about 49% of its total shipments and about 90% of those exports went to the United States. Hence, our concern when our American cousins start threatening to raise those trade barriers again.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270307">Is the steel industry important to our economic well-being? Absolutely. That is why we are not taking protectionist threats from the U.S. lying down. We have been engaged. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270308">What is clear is that the steel industry in North America is highly integrated. That is what happens when different countries work together to cooperate and expand their mutual trade opportunities. This integration has been increasing, thanks to the benefits of the North American Free Trade Agreement. This integration has gone even further with the consolidation that the steel industry has undergone over the past three or four years. Our Conservative government has been addressing the steel industry issues for many years, and we continue to do so.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270309">My colleague, the <Affiliation DbId="128690" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation>, is actively engaged with our American counterparts to address potential trade irritants. These include: unfair trade; government support for the steel industry in various countries, in other words subsidies; China and its steel policies; climate change policy; and the movement of manufacturing out of North America. I would add that our government and the industry have worked collaboratively on these issues in the past, and we expect to do so in the future.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270310">All Canadians know that Canada did not start this worldwide recession. It might take some time for the opposition for that to sink in, but in fact Canadians know that. Our government, under the leadership of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, continues to take steps to cushion our economy against the blows that many countries around the world feel from this economic crisis.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270311">We have responded by providing new powers to protect our banking system. Moreover, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> engaged in broad consultations with Canadians and industry leaders when drafting the economic action plan that was tabled in the House on January 27.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270312">Our action plan proposes measures amounting to $29 billion of stimulus in 2009 alone. That is the equivalent of almost 2% of the size of our economy. This is good news. We have covered many bases. We are reducing taxes. We are spending a lot of money on infrastructure to give our economy a shot in the arm. We are also protecting those who have lost their jobs due to the economic crisis around the world. We have enhanced EI benefits and we have enhanced training opportunities for those who have lost their jobs and want to find new places of employment.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270313">Our action plan also includes supporting shipyards with $175 million and the procurement of 98 new Coast Guard vessels. We are getting the job done. </ParaText>

I am confident, as we move forward, that we will be able to address those challenges. We have established a working relationship with the new administration in the United States.

							<ParaText id="1270338">I would like to tell the House a bit about my city if I may. London, for those who do not know, is the 10th largest city in Canada. We have a well balanced economy. We have an internationally respected health care system, with training hospitals throughout and major breakthroughs go on in London Health Sciences Centre regularly.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270339">London is a major transportation hub.

I tell the House this because as a transportation hub, the need for good road service is critical. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270341">London has strong rail service with service by CN and CP.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270342">Finally, we have London International Airport, which is one of Canada's busiest airports.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270343">Through many of my experiences in life, I am reminded of a book written by Robert Fulghum entitled <I>All I Ever Really Needed to Know I learned in Kindergarten</I>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270344">Unfortunately, many people told me, when I was running for office, that I was just working hard to get into Canada's largest kindergarten class. While I can see sometimes why there is a sentiment out there like that, I think that generalization is inappropriate for the majority of members.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270345">In my short time here I have quickly seen the efforts, the sacrifices and the energy members spend on behalf of their constituents, but I believe we can all do better.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270346">Just as in kindergarten, we get further ahead in life by building up those around us rather than tearing them down. That is why my good friend of many years, the member opposite from <Affiliation DbId="128271" Type="2">London North Centre</Affiliation>, and I established early that together we could achieve more than if we worked against each other. Our constituents have made it clear that they appreciate our positive, co-operative style more than the destructive partisanship that often prevails. We could all achieve more if we worked this way. I sincerely hope that will happen more often in the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270347">I am not hesitant to say that the member for <Affiliation DbId="128157" Type="2">York South—Weston</Affiliation> has contributed to this debate in a thoughtful way, with dialogue that is positive and well-intended. I am sure this has been noticed and I believe his constituents have seen that as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270348">In kindergarten we learn our manners. We learn that when people are speaking, we wait our turn and listen to what they have to say. Members will not find me heckling in question period or debate because no matter how much I disagree, or agree, with what a colleague is saying, if it is their turn to speak, then they deserve that respect.

Her family made many sacrifices for her to do that and I thank them as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270350">Perhaps one of the big things we learn after kindergarten is that we all get older and what we did back then forms us into who we are today. When I leave this place, as we all will some day, I hope to be able to look back and say I learned a lot, that in some fashion I made a contribution and, most important, that I helped make the lives of others a little better.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270351">I ask the indulgence of the House for one more analogy and then I will speak directly to the topic at hand.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270352">Today we are talking about trade, but this too we learned about in kindergarten. We learned that sharing toys, sharing resources made us all better off. We could hoard our toys, but we did not. My granddaughters sometimes do though. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270353">We did not hoard our resources then because it did not make sense and it does not make sense when we are adults either.

							<ParaText id="1270354">That is why I welcome this opportunity to discuss how much trade means to the Canadian economy and, most relevant to this discussion, how much the North American Free Trade Agreement has contributed to Canada's prosperity. I bring this up in our dialogue around the European Free Trade Agreement because it is important to understand how this agreement has enhanced Canada's economy and how future trade deals will continue to secure a positive economic future for Canadians.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="30">(1730)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1270355">I bring this up in our dialogue around the European Free Trade Agreement because it is important to understand how this agreement has enhanced Canada's economy and how future trade deals will continue to secure a positive economic future for Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270356">Canada's history is founded on trade. Canada is and must be a trading nation. We have an extremely well-educated innovative and progressive population. However, our domestic market is relatively small and therefore Canada is not considered a major player on the world stage. Well, that is our reality.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270357">Our market is only about one-tenth the size of the United States. Therefore, Canada needs the opportunities which international trade provides if we to realize our enormous potential. In these difficult economic times, international trade will continue to be a major contributor to our success in overcoming the challenges we are facing.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270358">How much do we depend on trade? In 2007 Canada's international trade was equivalent in value to more than two-thirds of our economy. An extraordinarily high number of Canadian jobs are linked to trade. In 2007 the value of our trade with the United States was equivalent to more than 46% of Canada's gross domestic product. This could not be more important than in cities like London, Ontario, where we see thousands of tonnes of goods travel between Canada and the United States every day by truck, rail and air.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270359">Healthy trade is vital to the survival of cities like mine. This trade represents a lot of economic activity and a lot of Canadian jobs, jobs that depend upon open borders and the preservation of international rules to keep them open.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270360">That is why the Conservative government supports an ambitious trade agenda in the World Trade Organization. It is why we value our trading relationship. It is why we are continuing to expand Canadian opportunities by negotiating new trade agreements, such as those with EFTA and Peru and Colombia. It is also why this government is working so hard to maintain the free flow of trade within North American markets at this time of economic crisis.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270361">No matter how much we diversify, North American trade will always loom large within our international trade priorities. Trilateral merchandise trade among the NAFTA partners has more than tripled since the agreement entered into effect and reached almost $1 billion in 2007.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270362">In terms of Canada-U.S. trade, about one-third is now said to be intra-firm, which means that it takes place across borders, but within the same company. No great deal more of Canada-U.S. trade involves building things together, different companies on different sides of the border contributing expertise, goods and labour to the manufacturing process.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270363">London is filled with multinational companies. These companies use our local expertise for parts of their operations and we rely on the expertise of their foreign branches for job stability. They cannot do it alone, nor can we.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270364">Look at General Dynamics Land Systems and Trojan Technologies, to name just two, that export significant products throughout the world. Without international trade, London could not survive. I would suggest that most cities across the country could not survive and prosper without free trade.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270365"> Let us not forget that NAFTA has opened doors between Canada and Mexico as well. Since signing onto NAFTA, our merchandise trade with Mexico has almost quintupled.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270366">Let us take a look at investment levels, which have seen a dramatic rise. In 2007 foreign direct investment in Canada reached just over $500 billion and almost 58% of this investment came from our NAFTA partners. In other words, about $6 out of every $10 in foreign direct investment in Canada, investment in communities across the country, came from NAFTA. Investors view Canada not only as an important market in its own right, but as a gateway to North America.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270367"> NAFTA also contributes to Canada's success on the world stage and is a valuable platform that Canada uses to reach the rest of the world.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270368">It is why we are pleased, as well, that the London International Airport has been approved for the cargo trans-shipment program. It opens up huge opportunities for all Canadian companies, but especially those in London.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270369">There are many benefits that Canada enjoys by being a partner in NAFTA, and it is not just large corporations. In fact, 94% of Canadian exporters are companies with fewer than 200 employees, 73% have fewer than 50 employees. These small businesses rely heavily on doing business within the North American marketplace. They rely on this government to provide the right conditions for them to succeed and to prosper, and this government will continue to deliver.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270370">For a country the size of Canada, which needs access to world markets to guarantee prosperity, it would be worse than naive to think that closing our borders to trade would boost the Canadian economy. In fact, the opposite is true. Any jobs created by turning inward would be vastly overshadowed by the jobs lost if our ability to export were curtailed. We would be naive to close our own markets, and we would be grossly negligent if we stood by while our trading partners closed theirs. We intend to do neither.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270371"> I have shown how Canadians have benefited from the NAFTA experience. I hope people realize, in talking about the importance of trade to Canada and the economic gains and job creation and spinoff effects for all of Canadian society, that NAFTA has mattered in a positive way. These are important reasons why our government will continue to defend against protectionism and ensure that we make the most of our current trade agreements and continue to seek ways to enhance Canada's trading position on the global stage.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270372">Finally, it is a sincere privilege for me as the member for London West to sit in the House.

Marie</Affiliation>. I would just like to inform his constituents that he is not well. He has been burning the candle at both ends and he is not able to do his speech. He had it ready and threw me some notes. I kind of feel like I felt once during the last term when I got here with about half a minute to go and I did not really know what I was going to say. Papers were flowing all over the place. However, I have a little more experience now so hopefully I will be okay.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270386">Free trade and NAFTA are debates that have been going on this country since we had the debate on whether or not to have the free trade agreement with the United States. We have heard today in the House many reasons for the idea of having open borders and free trade with our neighbour. On the other hand, many people feel that the agreement that was initially signed and subsequent agreements, such as NAFTA, have been detrimental to the prosperity of our country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270387">I suspect the answer lies somewhere in between and I would lean more to the detrimental side than to the other. Having said that, however, it is true that the agreement has opened up jobs, but on the other hand, we have lost close to 300,000 manufacturing jobs in this country alone.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270388">We have gained jobs but often the jobs that have been created are part time or are not well-paying jobs. We analyzed it and some analysts have looked at the agreement. As a result of free trade, the average working family, those people who need to make a halfway decent living to survive, are worse off than they were before.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270389">If we look at the area of agriculture, which I will go into a little more later, there have been some advantages but there have been many instances where it has really hurt our farmers. I will then actually talk a bit about the agreement and what it may be leading into, and that is a security and prosperity partnership.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270390">As I came into the House today, I brought my bundle of work, as I usually do, and I happened to notice a letter from Mr. Armstrong of Kaslo, which is very timely. I was about to answer the letter but maybe I will be able to comment a bit on what he says here and share it with my colleagues in the House. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270391">On the second page of his letter, he is concerned about the budget and has suggestions as to where we should go. He says, ”It is time to act as an independent country rather than an appendage of the U.S. I have two thoughts here. One is to renegotiate NAFTA. Eliminate Chapter 11. Corporations shouldn't have the right to sue governments and supersede national laws. Trade tribunals lack adequate transparency and accountability, and consistently reflect a strong pro-corporate bias”. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270392">I am not sure if many people in Canada know that since we negotiated NAFTA, corporations on both sides of the border can sue local governments. There has been a case of a Canadian corporation suing the California government because of its strong environmental laws. There are a number of documented cases where American corporations have sued and other corporations from other countries are suing our governments because of restrictions that they wish to impose on the environment with the idea that they want to protect their citizens.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270393">It seems ludicrous to me that we have allowed our negotiators to sign an agreement that allows foreign corporations to sue our governments so that our tax dollars go to pay out or to finance the legal proceedings to protect our citizens. It does seem bizarre. Therefore, when Mr. Armstrong says that we should renegotiate NAFTA, he might have a point there. Which other country in the world has signed away an agreement to allow corporations to sue representatives of the people?</ParaText><ParaText id="1270394">I would like to go further.The other contentious point of the whole NAFTA is the clause that says that we are locked into selling our oil and gas to the United States at a locked-in price, that we cannot cut back on our exports unless we cut back on our domestic consumption, which basically means that we have locked in our energy flow to the benefit of our neighbours to the south. We have been and continue to be a provider of raw materials to our neighbours to the south without having any control.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1270395">However, what is bizarre, if we look at what is happening east of Ottawa, is that we import 90% of our oil from offshore. On the one hand, we are selling our oil cheaply, allowing it to flow to the United States and we are building pipelines, and yet here we are importing 90% of our oil from other countries and areas of the world that may potentially be dangerous and from which, in the future, we may not be able to get our oil.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270396">Mr. Armstrong also talks about NAFTA and says that we should to get NAFTA out of food of agriculture. As I said before, I do not think it is one way or the other. We need to look at this but I believe that we in Canada should be looking at any trade agreements we sign through the lens of a Canadian, in other words, is it in the best interests of Canada to do this or that agreement? We have seen the recent bill that was passed in the House, unfortunately, that now allows European countries to partake in more of the shipbuilding industry and take away jobs in Canada. I would say that signed agreement would be to our detriment. We lose Canadian jobs and our industry continues to downslide as a result of that agreement. I do not think that is right.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270397">When I look at agriculture, a couple of things that stand out in my mind, which I talk about this a lot. One of them is the whole idea of dumping, and I will use the example of American apples, in our country. Because of NAFTA, we have allowed the free flow of fruit and vegetables across the border and what has happened from time to time is that the heavily subsidized apple industry in the United States has dumped apples at a price below the cost of production into Canadian markets.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270398">A tribunal exists to regulate this but by the time we get things in motion and by the time the lawyers are hired, often it is too late and by that time the apple producer has lost money. What has happened as a result of this? Many producers in British Columbia, Ontario and Nova Scotia have gone out of business. In the area that I represent, a lot of apple and fruit growers are converting to grapes because they are not able to make a living. One of the reasons for that is this agreement we have.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270399">In our province, I would like to remind other members, that before free trade we had something like a thousand onion producers. Now we have maybe a handful. We can see that we are getting cheap produce in our supermarkets but there are many farmers who have lost their livelihood because of these trade agreements. I do not think, as we move on to explore export markets and different markets for our produce, we should be doing it on the backs of those producers here in Canada.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270400">I want to talk a bit about the cattle industry and refer to a report that was published in November of last year by the National Farmers Union, entitled “The Farm Crisis and the Cattle Sector: Toward a New Analysis and New Solutions”. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270401">I am pleased to report that we have talked and we have discussed, and we will have this report before our agriculture committee where we will be able to have an in-depth look at it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270402">One of the areas in the report concerns what is happening. What has happened to the effect that before the Canadian-U.S. agreement was signed in 1989, our cattle producers were making close to around $200 a hundredweight. I checked this out last night at a banquet as I was talking to some folks. Now, when we level the different year and the dollar, they are making less than $100. Exports have tripled, primarily to the United States, to around $33 billion a year. They have tripled during this time span. Our cattle producers are making less than they were 20 years. Costs are going up, which we will be talking about in committee, exports have gone up and we have created new markets but they are making less money and many are being forced out of business.</ParaText>

He cannot make it any more as a business because of the high cost of input and the low cost he is receiving for his goods. Why did these prices fall? It coincides with our signing of NAFTA. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270404">According to the report, in May 1989, Cargill opened its High River, Alberta beef packing plant. Its entry into the country's beef packing sector marked a dramatic acceleration in the transfer of control in the industry from a relatively large number of Canadian-based packers operating a large number of plants to two U.S.-based corporations that have concentrated production into a few huge plants.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270405">Also in January 1989, “We implemented the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement thereby shifting Canada-U.S. market integration into high gear”.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270406">As a result of this, and this has happened in other sectors, the more takeover there has been of Canadian business, the more difficult it has become for the primary producer in our country. Another follow-up of this whole agreement that is affecting the cattle industry is what we call captive supply. The big players like Cargill can hold and feed a number of cattle and then let them out in the market when the price is right, thereby undercutting the producer who is shipping his cattle to auction. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270407">Those are some examples and, as I said, we will be debating this at agriculture committee. I know many people have read the report and it will be interesting to get some good feedback on this.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270408">The other item, when we look at free trade, is the pressure at the negotiations going on at the World Trade Organization. Last night I had the honour of being invited to the banquet, as many colleagues have, of the Dairy Farmers of Canada. Farmers have been here for the last two days talking to us and asking to please not give in to world pressure to modify or destroy our supply management.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270409">I would like to make the plea to please not give in to world pressure, not only to destroy our supply management, but to water down, or withdraw, or disintegrate our state trading enterprise, namely the Canadian Wheat Board. It is our business to do what we want to do, not from pressure from the WTO on supply management and the Wheat Board. I am hoping that the minister and the government will stand strong in defending our interests against this pressure. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270410">As we move on, we see other effects of free trade agreements. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128505" Type="2">Burnaby—New Westminster</Affiliation> has clearly outlined many times in the House the negative effect of the softwood lumber agreement. I have seen the devastating effect in my communities, in the forestry communities that have suffered, because we chose not to follow through with the legal process that we had. We signed the agreement and lost money. We see the effects of that with what is happening now in our forestry communities.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270411">I will now come to the topic of buy Canadian, buy American, is this protectionism or is it not. It is my understanding that the discussions going on in the United States in regard to buy American do fall within the framework of the free trade agreement. If that is the case and the Americans can have that, why can we not, while still maintaining our ties and our trade, offer preference in certain industries to local Canadian procurement? At the same time, instead of pushing and raising the voice against the violation of this agreement, why can we not work with our partners to ensure that if the policy goes through in their country that there is an exemption for Canadian steel? If the policy goes through in our country, then why can we not we exempt the industry that is supplying our citizens here in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270412">I need a question to pose to my colleagues. We are in tough economic times and we want to support industry. However, I have seen in my home province of British Columbia that we have purchased ferries to go between Vancouver Island and the Mainland from outside of the country and we have a shipbuilding industry here on both coasts.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1270413">The argument is that we got them for less. Of course we got them for less. The reason we got them for less is the people who are building them are probably making the equivalent of $2 an hour in some country that is on the way to being developed. Of course we can get them for less, and at the same time, our Canadian workers and their families suffer because of this kind of policy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270414">We talked about food security at the agriculture committee. We had a unanimous report, with the exception of one item. Everyone agreed to the various recommendations on food security. One of them was that Canada have a national procurement policy so that federal government institutions have as their priority to buy Canadian. We all agreed on that. It was agreed to by all the parties. We do agree on many items in our committee. The response we got back from the department was that we have to be careful of our trade obligations. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270415">Yet we have seen with our partner to the south, in spite of the trade obligations, problems at our border. There was the BSE crisis. Tariffs have been slapped on other agricultural produce. Different tariffs that exist to this very day have been slapped on goods being shipped down to the south because the Americans decided to do that within the trade agreement.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270416">Especially in these tough times it is important that we support our industry as much as possible. How can it be that our Department of National Defence signed a contract for military trucks with a U.S. company that actually operates in Canada but which will build the trucks in Texas? Meanwhile that company's plant in Chatham, Ontario, which is completely capable of doing that work, is laying off hundreds of people. It is hard to imagine why our own tax dollars are not being used to support our industry and our workers. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270417">In a recent Vector poll nine out of ten Canadians said that the government should favour Canadian made goods in public transit. Stronger domestic procurement has also been supported by groups like the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters and the Ontario Chamber of Commerce. In recent months over a dozen municipalities have passed resolutions committing to maximize Canadian content when purchasing goods and services.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270418">I would like to close by commenting on the latest dispute about the American steel policy. Rather than calling it a trade war and a violation of the agreements, we have to look carefully to see what is behind it. I read an article which said that what might be behind the policy are the strong American corporations that have offshore plants in other countries which would very much love not to have to adhere to a buy American policy so they could continue to make steel in other countries and bring it into the United States. The article presumes that maybe they are behind foreign governments, such as ours, lobbying the Americans to do away with this policy. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270419">It is a point of view which I think is worthwhile exploring. I would suggest to the government and to the minister that we look at that. Are we being duped? Are we as Canadians once again being duped by the multinationals that want to ensure that they have free access to the American and Canadian markets without any kind of control either by the Americans or the Canadians?</ParaText>

							<ParaText id="1270451">This is not the first time that the protectionist impulse has found expression in the United States, a protectionist impulse that is not unrelated to the economic crisis besetting the United States if not the global economic meltdown as a whole. In the months following the great stock market crash of 1929, and amidst the fear and uncertainty of that period, protectionist forces in the United States pushed for legislation that would shelter local industries and jobs. The result was, as we recall, the Smoot-Hawley act, which hiked tariffs to all-time highs on some 70 agricultural products and 900 manufactured items. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270452">Economists are divided on whether the law, which touched off retaliatory measures from both Europe and Canada, turned a deep recession into a protracted depression. However, on one thing they do agree: these protectionist measures took a bad situation and made it worse. For example, between 1929 and 1934 world trade declined 66%. Much of that weakening can be blamed squarely on the Smoot-Hawley act. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270453">Let us fast-forward to the 1980s, when the Government of Canada sought at the time to improve access to the United States markets to improve productivity and employment, encourage foreign direct investment, strengthen the competitiveness of Canadian firms in global markets and ensure the steady improvement of living standards for Canadians as a whole. Accordingly, in May of 1986, the Canadian and U.S. governments began to negotiate a free trade agreement. By October 19, 1987, this 20-chapter agreement was finalized. It came into effect on January 1, 1989.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270454">This agreement included a schedule for the elimination of all tariffs on trade between Canada and the U.S. by January 1, 1998. Admittedly, the implementation of this agreement generated employment losses in some sectors and gains in others. However, on the whole, the economies of both countries became more integrated. Exports flowed to the United States, and in turn there was more U.S. investment in Canada and the like. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270455">This brings me to NAFTA, the second of the three great trade agreements. In January of 1994, Canada, the U.S. and Mexico launched the North American Free Trade Agreement. Many of the same issues raised in the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement surfaced again with regard to NAFTA and found expression in the discussions and debate in this House. Canadian businesses wanted Mexico to open up for them, while organized labour and workers feared that Canadian businesses would relocate to Mexico to take advantage of lower labour costs and lower environmental standards.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270456">At the same time, Canadian nationalists wanted assurances that Canadian sovereignty would be respected and that Canada could protect its culture, water, resources, and standards on health, safety, labour and social programs. Some provinces were also worried about the potential impact of NAFTA on specific regional industries, whether it was British Columbia's softwood lumber or Ontario's car manufacturing. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270457">On the whole, I think one can say that the agreement did bring economic growth and rising standards of living for the citizens of all three countries, and that it established a strong foundation for future growth, however imperfect and inadequate some of the dimensions of that agreement may appear to be.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270458">This brings me to the third of the final agreements, the WTO agreement.

							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1270459">It operates under a spectrum of rules, which Canada and the U.S. contributed to, and we have a rule of law trade relation system.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270460">What the three agreements, these three path-breaking developments, really have in common and which should underpin now our multilayered representation to the United States and Canada with respect to this protectionist impulse, are the following.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270461">First, these are not just agreements on free trade, those which I have cited and referred to, but in fact they have ushered in a global culture of free trade.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270462">Second, they reflect the highly integrated nature of both the American and Canadian economies and the harm that protectionism would have on our industry, commerce and the economy of both countries. However, what must be appreciated is how unique the bilateral trade relationship is. I will quote certain data:</ParaText><ParaText id="1270463"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The cross-border flow of goods and services added up to almost $700 billion in 2008. The United States absorbs roughly four-fifths of Canada's exports, and supplies nearly two-thirds of its imports. The Canadian market, in return, takes up more than one-fifth of U. S. exports and provides one-sixth of its imports. Canada is a larger market for U. S. goods and services than all 27 countries of the European Union combined.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270464">The third principle is the importance of the rule of law underpinning the culture of free trade to which President Obama has referenced on more than one occasion.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270465">Finally, the fourth principle is the internationalization of free trade, that free trade is not just a bilateral norm or even a regional norm, but it has become an international norm underpinned by a whole framework of international law.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270466">The American president may be said to be a rule of law president. We saw this when among his first executive orders was an order to ban torture, to order the closing of Guantanamo and to ensure that the struggle against terror would be anchored in the rule of law.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270467">We saw this when, during the electoral campaign and then again in his inaugural address, the President spoke of the rule of law underpinning American foreign policy, international relations, United Nations multilateralism and the promotion of human security. We see this also in his eschewing of protectionism, which could trigger, as he put it, a trade war instead of global free trade.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270468">Therefore, I want to recommend that the rule of law not only underpin our bilateral relationships in the matter of free trade, but the entire Canada-U.S. relationship in the matter of international law, foreign policy and diplomacy as a whole in two respects, and I will close with these examples.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270469">First, President Obama has spoken of the importance of and, indeed, his commitment to the prevention of genocide. As we meet, we are confronted with two instances on genocide in the 21st century, the state sanctioned incitement to genocide in Ahmadinejad, Iran, and the genocide by attrition in Darfur.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270470">These remind us of the two great lessons of the last 60 years since the genocide convention was adopted on December 9, 194: first, that the Holocaust and the genocide that followed in the Balkans, Rwanda and Darfur occurred not because of any machinery of death but because of the state sanctioned incitement to genocide; and second, was that these mass atrocities occurred because of indifference and inaction on the part of the international community.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270471">Therefore, we should convey our willingness to work with President Obama, first, to invoke the rule of law principle and to invoke the remedies under the genocide convention to hold Ahmadinejad, Iran to account. In other words, the genocide convention and its obligations are not just a policy option. They are international legal obligations. As joint state parties to the genocide convention, we should work in order to combat the crime that has already been committed under the genocide convention, namely the direct and public incitement to genocide.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270472">The second is with regard to Darfur. We should work together with the American president to combat the genocide by attrition in Darfur and invoke the responsibility to protect principle under the rubric of the rule of law.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The City of Trois-Rivières has obviously worked hard to organize activities, and we are still awaiting confirmation from the federal government that we will receive a subsidy for these celebrations. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270486">In the midst of all this action, and after a number of meetings, City resolutions, plenty of questions, calls, meetings rescheduled by two ministers, I have come to realize that there is confusion between Trois-Rivières, the cultural capital, and the organization of the 375th anniversary of Trois-Rivières. These are two different things.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270487">The Trois-Rivières cultural development corporation submitted its request for the city to be recognized as a cultural capital of Canada over a year ago, and the city was awarded the title. This year, Trois-Rivières has another committee, a corporation that is organizing the 375th anniversary celebrations. The corporation has a president, a board of directors and an executive director, and it is organizing the festivities highlighting the 375th anniversary of the founding of Trois-Rivières, the second oldest francophone city—it goes without saying—in America. This is a major event that means a lot to Trois-Rivières. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270488">After the cultural capital of Canada title was bestowed on the city, departments seemed to think that the $2 million had been handed over. But Trois-Rivières has not yet received any funding for its 375th anniversary from the federal government. That is why I am not satisfied with the minister's answer, which does nothing to clear up the confusion. </ParaText><ParaText id="1270489">The debate was reignited during the last election when the Conservative candidate was quoted in a full-page spread in the daily <I>Le Nouvelliste</I>. She promised that as soon as she was elected a member of a Conservative government, she would deposit $2 million in the 375th anniversary celebration account.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1270490">Imagine how hopeful that made the people of Trois-Rivières feel. People believed that the government had finally seen their point of view and would help them out. Then, after I put the pressure on, I was told by some assistants that Trois-Rivières had not voted for the right party. I am the member for Trois-Rivières, but I am a member of the Bloc Québécois, not the Conservative candidate.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270491">Can the minister tell me whether this confusion will ever be cleared up and whether the government will give the 130,000 people of Trois-Rivières the money they need to organize their 375th anniversary celebration?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Mr. Lévesque said, “this prestigious title will allow us to finance a series of cultural activities in the context of the 375th anniversary of Trois-Rivières”.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270495">That is our commitment. We intend to follow through on that commitment. We intend to see this event through and assist Trois-Rivières in celebrating what will be a great celebration for all Canadians. At the 375th anniversary of Trois-Rivières, we will be standing shoulder to shoulder wishing bonne fête to the city of Trois-Rivières. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It is important to remember that many cities in Canada have been named as cultural capitals and were not celebrating a historic anniversary. Unfortunately for Trois-Rivières, as it turns out, it so happens that the city is celebrating its 375th anniversary in the same year it is a cultural capital.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270497">But one thing does not preclude the other. Mayor Lévesque was quoted as thanking the government for the $2 million the city had received as a cultural capital and added that this title would allow the city to finance a whole series of cultural activities in the context of the 375th anniversary. I believe the quote has the same meaning in French and English.</ParaText><ParaText id="1270498">“In the context” simply means that the 375th anniversary is happening in 2009.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
