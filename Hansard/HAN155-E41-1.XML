Second reading</ProceduralText><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Lukiwski" id="7694383"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170850" Type="18">Mr. Tom Lukiwski (Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2983536">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to resume debate on Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document>. I last spoke to this bill in December of last year. Unfortunately the time was not sufficient for me to complete my presentation, so I would like to continue, but before I do, I would like to point out a few elements of Bill C-21 that I spoke to in December. </ParaText><ParaText id="2983537">It is very important for all members to understand the reasons Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> has been introduced and some of the elements of the bill that will make the political loans regime a much more fair, open and transparent process for all parties and for all candidates.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983538">Without question the rationale for Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> and its genesis came as a result of the 2006 Liberal leadership campaign. As most members know and most Canadians know, there were several candidates who contested the leadership for the Liberal Party in 2006 who still have outstanding debts, in some cases, several thousands of dollars of debt. In fact there is one sitting MP, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170551" Type="2">Vancouver Centre</Affiliation>, who was a nominated candidate for the leadership of the Liberal Party who has still yet to repay her debts. </ParaText><ParaText id="2983539">We believe that to be absolutely unacceptable. Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> would remedy that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2983540"> I also want to point out that Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> will prevent individuals from lending money to leadership contestants. That is important because in the past there have been abuses of the loans regime. Let me give an illustration. Under the regime that we are currently working with, a wealthy individual, friend or relative could lend money to a leadership campaign candidate and have absolutely no realistic expectations of that loan ever being repaid. In fact, there could be times when an agreement would be struck between the lender and the candidate, and the lender would assure the candidate that he or she would never have to repay the loan because the lender would simply write it off.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983541">If that happened, it would be a clear abuse of the political loans regime and a clear abuse of the rules. Yet there is nothing under the current Elections Act provisions to prevent that from happening. If that happened, the so-called loan would in fact not be a loan at all. It would be a donation. It would be a contribution and there are laws and rules in place to prevent contributions from exceeding a certain limit. In order to prevent that type of abuse from occurring, Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> will prohibit individuals from lending money to leadership candidates.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2983542">In future, after Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> is adopted, only registered financial institutions, whether they be chartered banks, credit unions, caisse populaires, trust companies, et cetera, will be allowed to lend money. In addition, those institutions, as is the normal practice, will have to openly transmit their practice of lending, the interest rate, the terms of repayment and all other information that should be in the public purview and in the public domain.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983543">Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> will bring into force provisions that will increase accountability and transparency. Overall it will give the public the assurance that there are no abuses in the leadership or any candidate's campaign. I say that because Canadians have told us loud and clear that they do not agree from time to time with the regime of political donations exceeding the Federal Accountability Act levels. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2983544">However, abuses have occurred. I think all of us here can point to at least one or two examples where abuses have occurred, and unfortunately, the Chief Electoral Officer and Elections Canada are prevented from doing anything meaningful to stop them. Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> would do exactly that.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983545">There are a few other provisions in Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> that are not only timely but would assist all candidates in a leadership contest from incurring these debts, or at least would assist them in the repayment of their debts.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983546">We have read media reports recently where one of the candidates in the 2006 Liberal leadership campaign, Ms. Martha Hall Findlay, has stated that because of the current rules she has found it difficult if not outright impossible to repay her debt, which she still has six years after she ran for the leadership of the Liberal Party.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983547"> Ms. Hall Findlay says the reason it is difficult to repay the debt is that under the current provisions donations from individuals to a leadership candidate may only be given on a per-contest basis. In other words, since Ms. Hall Findlay ran for the leadership in 2006, her supporters who wanted to give the maximum contribution allowable, roughly $2,100, could only do so once because the rules say a person can only give one donation to one candidate for one contest.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2983548">Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> would change that so that individuals could give contributions to a leadership contestant on an annual basis. In fact it would allow existing debts to be paid off by allowing the same contributor to donate yearly to the maximum amount. This would assist candidates like Ms. Hall Findlay and others who have existing debts to pay off their debts.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983549">In fact, Ms. Hall Findlay has stated publicly that if the provisions of Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> were in force today, she would have her existing debt paid off in three days. I am not sure if that is an exaggeration or not, but we will see when Bill C-21 comes into effect how quickly Ms. Hall Findlay and other outstanding debtors pay off their debts.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983550">Finally, in the limited time that I have, I want to refute a political argument, or at least a political piece of rhetoric, that has been coming from the Liberal Party lately. It suggests that our government has delayed bringing Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> forward because we want to let those leadership candidates from 2006 continue to twist in the wind. Nothing could be further from the truth.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2983551"> We have continually, over the last several months, asked the opposition parties to give their tacit approval to Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> so we could debate it, send it to committee, after which speedy passage would then ensue. Until two days ago, we had not had that agreement. However, on Wednesday of this week, after several months of trying to get agreement from the opposition parties, we finally got their commitment to allow Bill C-21 to go forward with their support.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983552">That is why today we are hoping the debate will end and Bill C-21 will be voted upon at second reading to send it to committee. We want Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> to come into effect. I know all Canadians support it. Hopefully, the opposition parties will as well.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Davies (Vancouver East)" id="7694427"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170224" Type="2">Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2983553">Mr. Speaker, the member opposite gave a very good summary of the bill before us. </ParaText><ParaText id="2983554">As he knows, the NDP is supporting the bill at second reading, but I do have a couple of questions and they are real questions, actually.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983555"> This whole issue of financing political loans and raising money gets very complex. I wonder whether he thinks there are any loopholes that, if this were to pass, could possibly give an out in some way that would allow someone to go through the back door. I think that is the way we have to look at the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983556">Also, in terms of the current situation, where there are candidates who did not win and are now in arrears under the Canada Elections Act and will possibly get fined, what would their status be pending this new bill? Would the new bill be retroactive in terms of these candidates who have outstanding loans that have now gone beyond the limit? What would their status be?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Lukiwski" id="7694431"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170850" Type="18">Mr. Tom Lukiwski</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2983557">Mr. Speaker, in answer to the first question about loopholes, I would not want to suggest there are no loopholes. That is why bills have to be examined carefully at committee. </ParaText><ParaText id="2983558">However, there is something that the committee, during its examination of Bill C-21, should consider. As written, Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> states that if candidates at the local riding association level fail to repay any debts they incurred during their candidacy, the registered association or party would then be responsible for their debts. That is a good thing, so there cannot be any debts written off at the local level.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983559"> Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document>, however, does not provide for any debts incurred by leadership candidates of a registered federal party to be backstopped by the federal party. In other words, if someone runs for the leadership of the Liberal Party, and we know that the Liberals will be entering a leadership campaign shortly, whoever wins that campaign is obviously going to incur some debt. All candidates do. If the candidate becomes leader of the Liberal Party and still has unpaid debt after several years, Bill C-21 does not allow, or does not oblige, the federal Liberal Party to pay that debt. It does at the local level but not for leadership candidates at the federal level.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2983560">We may want to examine that at committee to make the same provisions at the federal leadership level as we do at the candidate level.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983561">With respect to whether it is retroactive, right now leadership candidates from 2006 in the Liberal campaign have this debt encumbrance. Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> would allow the new rules to come into effect for existing debt, but everything else would be on a go-forward basis. Bill C-21's provisions would only apply after it comes into effect, with the one exception being existing debt.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We are pleased that this bill has finally been introduced in the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983563">I would like to ask him a question about something he said at the end of his speech. He said that it is not true that the government delayed this bill. Yet the bill has been languishing for nearly a year since it was introduced. Why have the Conservatives not made more of an effort to consult the other parties over the past few weeks to get their support?</ParaText><ParaText id="2983564">Why did this take so long?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Lukiwski" id="7694438"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170850" Type="18">Mr. Tom Lukiwski</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2983565">Mr. Speaker, the reality is that we have been trying for well over a year, since Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> was first introduced, to get agreement from both opposition parties. We had agreement from the official opposition for many months. It wanted Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> to go forward. </ParaText><ParaText id="2983566">The difficulty was trying to get agreement from the Liberal Party. I do not know the rationale behind why the Liberal Party did not want Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> to come forward for further debate but that is the reality. Finally, as I mentioned two days ago, the Liberals indicated to us that they would be willing to support Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> to at least send it to committee. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2983567">We would have had Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> at committee many months ago if we had agreement from the opposition parties that they would support it. Even though we have a majority, the reason their support is necessary is that House time is very valuable and we do not want to introduce bills that will be delayed unnecessarily by filibusters, amendments and hoists, all of which are available technically and from a procedural standpoint to the opposition parties to delay passage of a bill. </ParaText><ParaText id="2983568">Rather than trying to delay House proceedings by introducing Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> when it would not get support from the opposition parties, we kept trying to negotiate behind the scenes with them, to ask them to let us know when they were finally ready to offer their support. We got that acceptance on Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> two days ago. It is introduced today. I fully expect debate to conclude today, which means we will probably be voting at second reading next week.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983569">We want Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> to be passed. We have wanted it since we introduced it. Now that we finally have support from the opposition parties it will go forward.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Uppal" id="7694474"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170707" Type="4">Hon. Tim Uppal (Minister of State (Democratic Reform), CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2983570">Mr. Speaker, my colleague made a very good speech and provided an explanation of the bill as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983571">It is great to have this co-operation with the opposition on moving this bill forward. We would like to see this co-operation on other bills, including the <Document DbId="5093616" Type="3">Senate reform bill</Document>. We would like that bill to move forward as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983572">We cannot blame Canadians for having a perceived sense of undue influence on politicians if they see unions, wealthy individuals or corporations lending money and that money never really being paid back. It is essentially an abuse of a loophole.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983573"> How does the member see this bill building and ensuring trust in our democratic institutions?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Lukiwski" id="7694477"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170850" Type="18">Mr. Tom Lukiwski</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2983574">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, the <Affiliation DbId="170707" Type="4">minister responsible for democratic reform</Affiliation>, not only for the question but for his leadership on this file and for introducing Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> to begin with.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983575">He has asked a very good question. I think I referenced in my speech that Canadians have many concerns regarding the entire political process. Some Canadians feel there are too many loopholes which allow politicians from all sides of the House an opportunity to abuse existing rules when it comes to political financing and political loans.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983576">This bill goes a long way to giving the general public the needed assurance with respect to financial transactions when dealing with leadership campaigns that contribution limits, et cetera, will be adhered to, because Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> does close a number of loopholes. I mentioned the most obvious. Bill C-21 will prevent individuals from lending money to candidates. That has been the biggest source of abuse that we have seen.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983577">In past leadership campaigns, in opposition parties in particular, we have seen a steady pattern of wealthy individuals lending several thousands, and in some cases, hundreds of thousands of dollars to a leadership candidate with no obligation for the candidate to repay the loan.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2983578">I say “loan” very suspiciously because if there was an agreement at any time between a candidate and a lender, where the lender said, “I will give you $100,000 for your leadership campaign and don't worry, brother, you'll never have to repay it, because I'll simply write it off”, it would not be a loan; it would be a contribution. That would seriously violate the current election financing and Elections Canada laws with respect to contributions to candidates.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983579">We want to see that potential abuse stopped. Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> does exactly that. It closes the loopholes that have existed for far too long.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Latendresse" id="7694482"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170255" Type="2">Ms. Alexandrine Latendresse (Louis-Saint-Laurent, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2983580">Mr. Speaker, since I am opening the debate today for my party, I would like to provide some background for the people who are watching us. There must be quite a lot of them this Friday morning.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983581"> In 2006, during the Liberal Party of Canada leadership race, some of the candidates took out campaign loans that they have never been able to repay in full. In so doing, they violated the Canada Elections Act. </ParaText><ParaText id="2983582"> The public will understand that those unpaid debts represent, in a sense, illegal loans. The money was used. So it represents an unfair advantage, even if the candidates were defeated or withdrew from the race. </ParaText><ParaText id="2983583"> In an election campaign, every penny counts. Everything is recorded, measured and filed. That is the surest way to be certain the electoral process is absolutely transparent and is not usurped by elements that have too great a vested interest or are too wealthy. </ParaText><ParaText id="2983584"> We can see this in a number of other countries in the world: money and power often coincide and sometimes are simply indistinguishable. Plutocracy, mafia states, tax havens and the rest are more the rule than the exception. When Canadians find themselves looking at governments like those, they shrug their shoulders and dream of Westminster parliamentarianism, as unshakable and incorruptible as the Rock of Gibraltar.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983585"> We have confidence in our democracy. Just as well, because the world is already dark enough. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2983586"> Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> is one more step we are taking to make sure our system continues to be incorruptible and reliable.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983587"> Certainly, in the case of the four unsuccessful candidates for the Liberal leadership, none of it has anything to do with the forces of darkness. It is simply a case of biting off more than they could chew. The candidates borrowed more than they could repay. </ParaText><ParaText id="2983588"> When it came time to clamp down on those abuses, no one really knew what to do. I note that these events date from 2006. A lot of water has passed under the bridge since then. There have been two leaders, who have seen their party’s fortunes decline with each election. The Liberal Party has found itself, little by little, packed into the back of the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983589"> There is still no resolution in sight.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983590"> Recently, the Ontario Superior Court delivered a judgment convicting the four individuals at fault. The judgment says there was a violation of the Canada Elections Act, and the guilty parties have to pay a fine of $1,000 or serve a custodial sentence of three months.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983591"> I want to say immediately that I have some reservations about the seriousness of the crime, because we do have to be honest with the public, who may not have followed the case closely. The embarrassment these four candidates have experienced has been widely exploited by the Conservative Party in its never-ending war of blind hatred for the Liberal Party.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2983592"> The debts of these four candidates would have been repaid long since if the rules had not been tightened just at the right time by the government, which for once demonstrated Machiavellian skill. What a surprise. Ordinarily, its big, finely orchestrated schemes are about as airtight as a Zeppelin on fire.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983593"> Political game-playing has therefore played a big role in dragging this situation out beyond all reason. Officially, Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> is an attempt to prevent abuses like this from happening again, but let us be frank: everyone was very happy to be able to heap scorn on the guilty parties for as long as possible. </ParaText><ParaText id="2983594"> Personally, I find that cruel and stupid. But in politics, it is all a game of tug-of-war. Everyone loves a good fight. Leave your flank exposed and you will be knifed. These malicious rules are so widely accepted that even the victim applauds. </ParaText><ParaText id="2983595"> It is malicious, but apparently we must accept it and make the best of it.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983596"> Fine. And so I have the honour of announcing a first. I rise today to support the government’s bill. Surprise.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983597"> I hold no illusions as to the motives that have prompted the Conservatives to tighten the party financing rules, nor do I believe that this is a particularly brilliant effort at legislating, but what can you do? It is a sort of a step in the right direction.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2983598"> If my enthusiasm seems a little lukewarm, it is because I see all too well the childish political games hiding behind this bill. This is the fifth attempt the Conservative government has made since it came to power to reform party financing. It has dragged the process out long enough to entrench the offence and prevent it from being resolved.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983599">The Chief Electoral Officer has said that any offence under the Canada Elections Act relating to financing is very difficult to punish properly. Today, we are seeing that ourselves for the umpteenth time. It all dates back to 2006, before the Conservatives came to power. The Chief Electoral Officer has even told me, and it is very clear, that the law as it is now written is “not only overly complex, it’s incoherent and ineffective”.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983600"> And we have the evidence of that as well. Eight years later, nothing has been done. The Chief Electoral Officer has repeatedly asked Parliament to resolve the many problems associated with the law regarding loans. </ParaText><ParaText id="2983601"> As my colleague the parliamentary secretary said just now, one of the biggest changes proposed in Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> would amend the limit on donations by individuals during leadership races. At present, because of the way the system is designed, people may contribute only once per leadership race. Under the proposed changes, those limits would apply on an annual basis. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2983602"> These are probably the changes that will help the people who still have debts at present the most.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2983603"> Again, as my colleague said earlier, Ms. Findlay, who took part in the Liberal leadership convention, has even said that under the new changes proposed by Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document>, she would be able to pay off her campaign debt in three days. That would in fact be surprising, given that it has been several years since those loans were taken out.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983604"> We believe it is important to make changes to this act, because everyone is calling for them. We know it is badly designed, it is badly formulated, and it generates a host of problems when it comes to political financing.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983605"> The Conservative Party can feign indignation at the Chief Electoral Officer if it likes and call for the act to be enforced, but everyone knows that at the end of the day, they are very happy to be able to torture the four guilty parties and use that back door to strip their old adversaries of all possible merit while they are down.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2983606"> We believe it is very important for these changes to be made as quickly as possible and for the little political games to end. There is a lot of talk about that leadership convention in particular, because the debts incurred are still enormous. But still, they are not the only ones. We are talking about 80 candidates, 21 of them Conservatives, who still have debts they have not paid off because the law was too badly designed. The law regarding political loans really has to be changed. </ParaText><ParaText id="2983607"> There are several points in Bill C-21 that need to be examined. We in the NDP have decided to support the bill so it can be sent to committee, so we can look at each of those points properly, and so we can go ahead and make changes that are not just desirable, but absolutely necessary, because as it now stands, this act is not satisfactory. That is why I recommend that our party support this bill at second reading.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Among other things, the bill proposes to prohibit political entities from receiving corporate or union loans. Financial institutions, individuals, political parties and associations will still be authorized to grant or guarantee loans, as long as the terms of the loan, such as the interest rate, are divulged and everything is put down in writing.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2983630">As my colleague mentioned, Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> is a step in the right direction. The bill, to its credit, prevents situations like the one the Liberal Party currently finds itself in from happening again. Let us remember that, six years after the leadership race, many candidates still have not reimbursed the total amount of the loans they received to run their campaigns.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983631">The issue even went before the Supreme Court of Ontario, which recently found the failed candidates with loans in arrears guilty of violating the Canada Elections Act. The court sentenced them to pay a fine of $1,000 or to serve three months in prison. It is important to note that, under Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document>, these loans that were not repaid would be considered political contributions after a period of three years.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983632">In the report that he submitted to Parliament in 2007, the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada said:</ParaText><ParaText id="2983633"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The loans granted by lenders—who are not in the business of lending, who lend money at non-commercial rates, with terms that are not available to others, or in cases where there is little prospect of reimbursement—may be perceived as a means to influence the political entity to which the funds are provided.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2983634"> The Chief Electoral Officer highlighted a weakness in our election financing system: lenders might try to influence political entities. That weakness had to be remedied. We have a duty and a responsibility to do everything we can to limit the influence of outsiders over political entities in this country. Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> proposes a solution worthy of consideration, and that is why, as was noted earlier, we are going to support it at second reading.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983635"> Once it is sent to committee, we will be able to improve it. While Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> means we are taking a step in the right direction, it is still in need of improvement. Yes, we support it, and I hope the Conservative Party will also be open to our solutions. For example, limiting the number of potential lenders is a good idea in theory, but in practice, problems might arise. </ParaText><ParaText id="2983636"> Take the case of financial institutions. As the bill now stands, there is nothing that provides for establishing rules that can guarantee a degree of impartiality on the part of the banks in granting loans.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2983637"> Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> contains nothing that could guarantee that this process is fair to all candidates, regardless of party. The minister himself said in the past that he did not see the benefit of making the banks subject to a regulatory framework under Bill C-21. That is quite surprising to hear from the minister, because if his objective is to make the process transparent and democratic, it would be to our benefit to see this kind of thing in the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983638"> Without clear rules to guarantee that the lending process is fair, we can easily imagine that the banks might be, let us say, more inclined to lend to certain candidates than to others.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2983639"> That is not to say that this would happen systematically, but the risk of a bank denying a candidate a loan for political reasons exists, and that should never be the case. It is important to address that issue. Without clear rules, we are opening the door to the possibility of a bank denying a loan to a political entity on the grounds that it advocates an agenda the bank considers to be against its interests.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983640"> For example, would a bank agree to lend to a political entity that was proposing higher taxes on its profits? Perhaps; it might. The risk of it refusing based on the ideas advocated by the entity in question is our justification for making amendments to the bill. That is exactly the situation that has to be avoided.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983641"> Mr. Speaker, you will tell us that the banks are already free to grant or deny a loan to whomever they see fit. Fine. But by limiting the number of entities that are entitled to make loans, Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> places more power in the hands of the financial institutions. That power must not have an impact on candidates’ ability to finance their campaigns. That would completely defeat the objectives and the intent of the bill. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2983642">I hope that the minister and his Conservative colleagues will agree to work with the official opposition to prevent Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> from creating two classes of candidates: those who have no trouble raising campaign funds because they advocate ideas that will help banks make money, and all the other candidates.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983643">After introducing the bill, the Conservatives issued a news release stating their intent to implement high standards of integrity in the political process. That is all well and good, but the government must work with all parties to ensure that integrity in the political process is achieved.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983644">If that is truly their intention, why did they recently condemn public funding of political parties, which had the advantage of avoiding and eliminating any possibility of allegiance or political scandal?</ParaText><ParaText id="2983645">It seems to me that the best way to curb private money's influence in the political sphere is to remove private money from the equation. Unfortunately, that is not the approach the government chose.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983646">The NDP believes that any action taken to ensure that political funding and loans are as transparent as possible is a very good thing.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2983647">That is why, as another colleague said, we will support Bill C-21 at second reading. I sincerely hope that the Conservatives will be open to the changes we propose in committee, even though that has not been our experience in the past, I must say. We all have an interest in guaranteeing the independence of the people's representatives in this country. It is our duty to be above reproach, and we must prevent politicians from using their influence to obtain favours.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I will start by saying that we will support this bill at second reading. I know it is rare for us to support a bill, but it is also rare for us to be able to examine an individual bill that is not part of a big omnibus bill. I ask the Conservatives to take that into consideration.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2983666">This bill prohibits corporations and businesses from granting loans to political entities. “Political entities” refers to political parties, associations, leadership candidates or candidates for nomination. Furthermore, this bill sets a time limit for paying back loans taken out by political entities: three years for leadership candidates, four months for a leadership candidate and three years for an association or party.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983667">It is important to set limits on repaying loans. Otherwise, debts could accumulate indefinitely. Moreover, there is typically interest on these loans, which can be very detrimental to someone who, after running for leader or for election, will unfortunately have a lot of debt for a very long time.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983668">Political parties will be responsible for paying back loans that are not paid back by the candidates themselves. Obviously, it is important for the financial institutions granting these loans to know that someone will be responsible for paying them back.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2983669">Another measure that I find very interesting is the measure that will enable leadership candidates to receive gifts up to a maximum amount per year instead of an amount per campaign. If someone is still in debt two years after the leadership campaign and has already asked all of his contacts, friends, family members and supporters to make a maximum donation, he is in trouble because those people cannot give the maximum amount again, which limits candidates' ability to raise funds to pay back loans within the deadline. This is a very interesting measure. I congratulate the government for having thought about this problem and for putting this measure in Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document>.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2983670">It is very important for us, as parliamentarians, to try to find solutions to the problem of debt incurred by candidates during elections or leadership races. These people end up with huge amounts of debt that they are unable to repay. We know that some of the candidates in our own leadership race still have a little bit of debt. There are also candidates in the leadership races of other parties who unfortunately still have a great deal of debt.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983671">This measure is important for someone who will stand for election because they will know the consequences of ringing up that amount of debt. If they know that they have three years to repay the money, they may think twice about how much money they are going to spend and if they are capable of paying it back. This will also make people who stand for election more accountable.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2983672">In 2007, the Chief Electoral Officer released a report on political financing, which contained a number of recommendations. The changes proposed by the Chief Electoral Officer were intended to limit the influence of individuals and corporations on political entities, an influence that can be exercised through financing. Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> takes these recommendations into account. Once again, I congratulate the government for responding to the Chief Electoral Officer's recommendations. We know that quite often the government does not follow through with recommendations made by various stakeholders.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983673">The changes proposed by Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> seek to eliminate the influence by the more well-to-do in the political world. If a lobby, corporation or individual with a lot of money can provide a loan to a candidate, the latter may be influenced by the ideas of the group, corporation or individual.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="55">(1055)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2983674">For example, if a group campaigns for a certain cause, the person may feel obligated to advance that cause in particular. I think that it is extremely important to bring back this aspect of democracy and to limit this type of individual or corporate loan. It would be extremely unfair if this could happen. It is thus extremely important that we take action, that we support these measures and that we limit financiers' influence on politics.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983675">As we know, there are groups that may have really good ideas or policies, but they may not be able to provide a loan because of financial difficulties. It is thus important to be able to level the playing field so that people cannot say that certain groups with more money will be listened to but it is tough luck for everyone else.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2983676">I am also calling on the government to assess the point that my colleague mentioned in her speech. Some financial institutions may be more inclined than others to give parties loans. This is a cause for concern. I understand that financial institutions are supposed to act in an impartial and non-partisan manner, but one never knows. I think that it is this government's duty to assess the issue in committee in order to determine if there is a way to prevent this phenomenon.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983677">I would like to once again applaud the measures put forward. However, I would just like to point out the fact that it is somewhat contradictory to promote these measures that will improve transparency by trying to limit candidates' debt and yet, at the same time, be prepared to limit the amount of money that political parties receive for each vote.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983678">I see that my time is up.

					<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Davies (Vancouver East)" id="7694867"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170224" Type="2">Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2983990">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document>, which would amend the provisions of the Canada Elections Act that affects loans and guarantees to political entities, whether registered parties, registered associations, candidates, leadership contestants or nomination contestants.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983991"> I am splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="170575" Type="2">Québec</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983992">It is an important bill and, as I said earlier, it is a complex issue. We should recognize that when people run for leadership for a political party, it is a huge undertaking financially and in terms of a political commitment to their family, community, party and the country. It is easy to focus on some of the problems that occur, and there are problems, and that is why the bill has come forward. We should also remember the enormous sacrifice that people make, no matter what party, when they decide to run for the leadership. </ParaText><ParaText id="2983993">The NDP just went through a leadership race. It was an incredible democratic process. We had hundreds of thousands of Canadians engaged in that process, culminating in the election of our new leader from <Affiliation DbId="170208" Type="2">Outremont</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983994">When we went to the candidate meetings or had interaction with the candidates, our party could see how incredibly hard-working they were and the time and energy everybody put into their campaign teams.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983995">We need to recognize that because politics gets such a bad name. People feel cynical and it is partly because of financial issues. Bills like this one tend to reinforce the negative side. Therefore, let us also be positive and celebrate the fact that individuals make this commitment to give that kind of public service. I wanted to begin my remarks with that because it needs to be said. </ParaText><ParaText id="2983996">We support the bill at second reading. There will be a general rule that loans and guarantees to political entities are prohibited. There are exceptions to that. Financial institutions can give loans to political entities at a market interest rate and in writing, so that is a very clear, transparent thing. Individuals can as well, as long as they respect the limit under the act, which, as of January, was I believe $1,200, and as long as the loans are repaid, a very key point, within the calendar year or guarantees for which an individual is no longer liable in the calendar year will not be taken into consideration for an individual's contribution, loan and guarantee limit.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983997">Finally, one of the three exceptions is that political parties or associations can make loans or stand surety for loans to a candidate or an association as long as it is in writing. There are some very clear rules.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983998">Just by way of background, I was in Parliament in 2003 when the original bill, and I do not remember the name of it but it was under the Jean Chrétien government, came forward and reformed political financing. It sought to limit the donations to political entities from private individuals and legal persons, but at that time it did not limit political loans.</ParaText><ParaText id="2983999">That was very important legislation and it did create a benchmark to ensure that Canadian political process and running in an election and so on was fair. It was a very historic.</ParaText><ParaText id="2984000">I would compare us with the United States where there is virtually no rules. An individual has to raise millions and millions of dollars. Most of us could never run in the U.S. We simply would be unable to raise the kind of money as progressive people taking strong stands. We would never get all the lobbyists and so on. I always think about the situation in the U.S. where it is so much controlled by big lobbyists and big financial contributions. Therefore, the bill introduced in 2003 was very important.</ParaText><ParaText id="2984001">In 2006 the Federal Accountability Act was the first legislation introduced by the Conservative government, and the NDP was very instrumental. I remember the member for <Affiliation DbId="170429" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> worked very hard with the minister at the time. That also was an important act, which lowered the maximum annual limit from $5,000 to $1,000, but it did not address the issue of political loans.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2984002">It is curious that in both 2003 and 2006, neither of those pieces of legislation from two different governments and two different political parties dealt with the question of political loans. I would like to put on the record that the NDP has always been in favour of limiting what we would characterize as the influence of third parties, both on political parties and during leadership contests. </ParaText><ParaText id="2984003">It seems to me that the principle here is to ensure that there is transparency, that there are clear rules, that there are not ways to get around the rules and make oneself a loan or have someone make a loan that we know would never be repayable. Our party has always had an understanding, support, and advocacy for this kind of principle in favour of limiting the influence of third parties. This is why we are supporting the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="2984004">I would go further and say that Ed Broadbent, the former member for Ottawa Centre, former leader of the NDP, and a very well-known member of Parliament, made an enormous contribution in his time serving the House. He put forward a platform that called for transparency, clear rules, cleaning up politics for stronger accountability, and financing rules for leadership contests. That is what we are also talking about today. Sometimes we forget these things, so it is good to put on the record the work of a former colleague who really did make a difference and who espoused these principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability. I want to give kudos to Mr. Ed Broadbent for doing that.</ParaText><ParaText id="2984005">When we debated the accountability act in 2006, we were very clear that it should have included provisions on political loans. We deplored the fact that it was silent on this matter. Again, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170429" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> did an enormous amount of work. We ended up agreeing as far as the bill went that we would support it, but we always believed that it should go further.</ParaText><ParaText id="2984006">Here we are today in 2012. The bill before us has had quite a history and has already been hanging around for almost a year. It was previously Bill <Document DbId="4463679" Type="3">C-19</Document> and <Document DbId="3120196" Type="3">C-29</Document>. It has had various versions, and here it is being debated today. I think it was the government House leader who said earlier that the government would push and convince all the opposition parties to deal with the bill. Quite clearly, for us in the NDP, we have always supported these kinds of measures and we will support the bill in principle.</ParaText><ParaText id="2984007">I want to end on this note. This is a very complex issue. One has to really go through this stuff with a fine-tooth comb and see whether or not there are loopholes. I hope that when it gets to the committee, its members will almost look at it from a negative point of view, from the point of view of how someone can get around it. We need to ask ourselves that question to ensure that the bill is sufficient and adequate and covers the principles that it espouses. I am glad that we are supporting the bill and look forward to it being at committee.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Papillon" id="7694875"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170575" Type="2">Ms. Annick Papillon (Québec, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2984008">Mr. Speaker, I first want to tell my colleague that I really enjoyed her insightful speech.

It has good standing with an international reputation. However, as the member points out, this stuff gets complicated, even for MPs. We want to follow the rules and do what is right, but there are so many nuances and things to pay attention to in terms of election financial reporting and so on. Therefore, anything we can do, through this bill or other measures, would make the process clearer and more transparent for both ourselves and the general public in terms of accountability.</ParaText><ParaText id="2984013">We have seen all kinds of awful situations.

However, it does require a very close examination to ensure that one cannot get around the principles being put forward on loans by doing indirectly what one is not allowed to do directly.</ParaText><ParaText id="2984019"> I have full confidence that the NDP members on committee who get this bill will do their due diligence in examining the bill in great detail. Maybe there will be amendments and when it comes back at report stage we will have an improved bill.

I look forward to it.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Papillon" id="7694886"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170575" Type="2">Ms. Annick Papillon (Québec, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2984020">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise here in the House and to take part in today's debate on Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document>. I would like to begin my comments on this bill by paying tribute to a former leader of the New Democratic Party of Canada, who represented the Ottawa Centre riding, for he was the first person to point out that the political donation regime in this country has a very obvious loophole. Mr. Broadbent had the sense to recognize that even though the maximum amounts of money that can be donated to a political campaign or to a political party had been reduced, by allowing these huge loans, which never really have to be paid back, it was obvious that somebody with a lack of ethical standards would take advantage of that loophole and act as though there were no financial limits. I therefore wish to recognize Mr. Broadbent for raising this issue for us in his ethics package. </ParaText><ParaText id="2984021">The reforms to our political financing regime introduced by the Liberal government in 2003 limited donations to political parties from individuals and corporations, but, they did not limit political loans. The Federal Accountability Act, which passed in 2006, amended the political financing regime by lowering private contribution limits from $5,000 to $1,000, but it did not address the question of loans. That explains why we are debating this here today, and that is what Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> is meant to correct. Everyone agrees that this is a problem. We need to listen to all of the solutions being proposed and, together, come up with the best way to solve the problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="2984022">Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> proposes prohibiting unions and corporations from granting loans to political parties and election candidates. Most of these changes were requested by the Chief Electoral Officer some years ago. Indeed, in 2007, the Chief Electoral Officer published a report on political financing that included a series of recommendations. The Chief Electoral Officer's proposed changes were aimed at limiting the influence of individuals or corporations on political parties, since this can occur through financing. Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> is based largely on those recommendations, which is why we support it at second reading.</ParaText><ParaText id="2984023">This bill, if passed, would establish a strict reporting regime for all political loans, which would include the mandatory disclosure of the identity of the lender and the terms of the loan, such as the interest rates. In addition, loans by individuals would be limited to $1,100 and only banks and political parties would be authorized to lend higher amounts. Under this bill, loans from individuals not repaid within 18 months would be considered contributions, and loans not repaid to financial institutions would be transferred to riding associations, which would become responsible for their repayment.</ParaText><ParaText id="2984024">At present, the rules for political loans do not satisfy the standards of accountability, integrity and transparency that Canadians expect of their political process. I cannot emphasize enough how important this is. In that regard, Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> seems to be a step in the right direction and that is why the NDP will support it. Believe me, we are here to support any good initiative. For once, the government is headed in the right direction.</ParaText><ParaText id="2984025">These new measures will foster greater fairness and ensure that the political process is and will always be in the hands of the people. A campaign should always be about ideas and not about who can spend the most money. That is not what a leadership race should be about. Members must first and foremost be accountable to their voters. It is important to eliminate the possibility of undue influence of elected representatives by corporations.</ParaText><ParaText id="2984026">Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> would also amend rules for leadership races. In that regard, the most striking example, and the one that has garnered the most public attention, is the Liberal Party of Canada leadership race.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2984027">Even if companies and unions did not have the right to contribute a single dollar, they could still lend tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars. Individuals could also lend much more than they were allowed to donate. We do not want to see a repeat of what happened with that party, where six years later, leadership candidates seem to have simply abandoned the idea of repaying their campaign debts. It is completely unacceptable.</ParaText><ParaText id="2984028">If that is the case and a candidate was backed by individuals, then in reality those individuals bankrolled a big part of the candidate's campaign. If the debt is never paid off, then we end up in exactly the situation that we are trying to avoid, which is single individuals, single corporations and single unions providing tens, and possibly hundreds of thousands of dollars to one candidate. </ParaText><ParaText id="2984029">Liberal members point out that Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> could prevent more women from entering politics. I think that the reverse is true. The bill will level the playing field so that people who are sponsored by companies, as was the case in the Liberal Party of Canada leadership race, will not have a competitive advantage over a woman who does not have this sort of backing. The purpose of Bill C-21 is to eliminate the influence of the wealthy in politics, while the under-representation of women in politics is a complex issue due to many factors that go well beyond political loans.</ParaText><ParaText id="2984030">Some members are wondering how they will be able to raise money if backers are only authorized to donate a maximum of $1,100 per candidate. They are also concerned about the fact that Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document> will prevent donors from making a donation to a leadership contestant if the candidate has outstanding debts. </ParaText><ParaText id="2984031">The Chief Electoral Officer, Marc Mayrand, recently made a very important statement. He said that it is virtually impossible to enforce the law on political loans because it is “not only overly complex, it's incoherent and ineffective.” </ParaText><ParaText id="2984032">We have this expertise, we have recommendations from Elections Canada. This is an example that relates to Bill <Document DbId="5208283" Type="3">C-21</Document>. However, in all kinds of other scandals where we have to shed light on what happened, it is important—I cannot repeat that enough—for this government to listen to recommendations from Elections Canada and the experts working in the field, to take the necessary action.</ParaText><ParaText id="2984033">A number of these concerns from people in the field are legitimate, and that is why we must carefully examine each clause of this bill. I hope that there will be some latitude in committee to discuss what kind of system to adopt and what protection measures could be implemented. Every time we consider limiting the ways Canadians can collect funds to participate in an election, we must ensure not only that the system is fair, but also that everyone has access to funding, regardless of political affiliation.</ParaText><ParaText id="2984034">We support the idea of eliminating the loophole. However, we feel that some improvements are necessary in order to strengthen our system.</ParaText><ParaText id="2984035">We are very concerned to see banks and other financial institutions become the sole sources of financing without being required to subsidize all parties, regardless of the circumstances. This is a big problem, but we can resolve it. If we want, we can find ways to include conditions that would be acceptable to everyone involved, in order to make things fairer.</ParaText><ParaText id="2984036">I am sure that we could find a solution that would meet the government's objectives—to standardize the financial rules—and ensure that our electoral laws are applied equally across the country, so that in future federal elections, everyone—and I mean everyone—has equal opportunity and those who are supported by certain companies do not have an unfair competitive advantage. </ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Boutin-Sweet" id="7694899"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170151" Type="2">Ms. Marjolaine Boutin-Sweet (Hochelaga, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2984037">Mr. Speaker, in the last election in May 2011, the NDP succeeded in getting a record 40% women elected.

It amends the Canada Elections Act in the following ways: All loans to political entities, including mandatory disclosure of terms and the identity of all lenders and loan guarantees, must be uniform and transparent. We are fine with that. Unions and corporations are prohibited from making loans to political parties, associations, or candidates. That is fine. Limiting the amount of loans and loan guarantees that individuals can make within the framework of the permitted individual annual contribution is also fine. Limiting the ability of financial institutions and political entities to make loans beyond the annual contribution limit for individuals and only at commercial rates of interest is the part we do not agree with. Finally, there are tighter rules for the treatment of unpaid loans to ensure candidates cannot walk away from unpaid loans.</ParaText><ParaText id="2984056">The Liberal caucus certainly is in favour of full transparency and disclosure of political loans. We are also in favour of forcing those loans to bear commercial interest rates. </ParaText><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="2984057"> What is a problem for us is when the bill says that only financial institutions or banks will have the authority to make these loans.</ParaText><ParaText id="2984058"> Before entering politics, 12 years ago, I worked for the Royal Bank. So I am well aware of how banks work. In my view, it is not the banks that asked for this exclusive authority, but rather the government that wants to give it to them. This puts too much power into the hands of the banks. Basically, the banks would have the authority to make political choices by lending money to the candidate they like the most and by not giving a loan to a candidate they do not like. I am not saying that that is what they would do, but all the same, it gives excessive power to the financial institutions.</ParaText><ParaText id="2984059"> Furthermore, with these rules, the candidates with more money, the candidates who are wealthier, would have an advantage, because they would have a better credit rating than candidates who are not as wealthy. This kind of system would favour the rich rather than treating everyone fairly. The system might also be unfavourable to women, especially to those who are going back into the labour market after a number of years at home. They might be less able to borrow money from a bank because they would not have as much money.</ParaText><ParaText id="2984060"> For all of these reasons, the Liberals will be voting against this bill.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="2984061"> I want to emphasize that it is only the exclusive aspect of the banks being the only lenders that we object to.

I do not agree at all. Financial institutions are not the only thing that matters when we talk about women becoming involved in politics.

It is much more than just a question of money; it is a question of openness, of position and of the steps being taken to promote the involvement of women. </ParaText><ParaText id="2984069"> What does the Liberal Party have to propose to encourage women to become more involved in politics, as the NDP has done? Is it prepared to be more open so the interests of women are represented? I can give as an example the vote on motion M-312 earlier this week.
