The House resumed from May 16 consideration of Bill <Document DbId="3095171" Type="3">C-21, An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act</Document>, as reported  (with  amendment)  from the committee, and of the motions in Group No. 1.
</ParaText><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Neville" id="2491714"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78535" Type="2">Hon. Anita Neville (Winnipeg South Centre, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1123431">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to stand today to speak in support of the amended Bill <Document DbId="3095171" Type="3">C-21</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123432">Members will recall that the bill was first introduced into the House in the 39th session of Parliament as Bill <Document DbId="2590516" Type="3">C-44</Document>. It has been re-introduced into the House as Bill <Document DbId="3095171" Type="3">C-21</Document> and has gone through a very lengthy committee process. It has now come back to the House in its amended form for final conclusion.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123433">To recap, members will remember that the act would repeal section 67 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which excludes Indians who live or work on reserve from filing human rights complaints with the Canadian Human Rights Commission in respect of any alleged human rights violations that relate to any action arising from or pursuant to the Indian Act.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123434">I want to make it very clear from the outset that this party, this official opposition, has supported the intent of the bill. The repeal of section 67 of the Human Rights Act has been a long time in coming and it is something that we support very much.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123435">What we did not support was the manner in which the bill was brought forward, both in its initial introduction and in its subsequent introduction as Bill <Document DbId="3095171" Type="3">C-21</Document>. It was brought forward without any consultation with first nations communities. We heard that there were significant concerns about the legislation, but there seemed to be absolutely no will, commitment, effort or respect on the part of the government to address some of those concerns. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123436">I am repeating myself, but I want to make it very clear. I said, at least 18 times, in the House or in committee, as did my colleagues, that we supported the repeal of section 67 of the Human Rights Act. We did not support the process in which the government chose, as one of the chiefs from Alberta said, to ram it down their throats. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123437">We are proud to support the amended legislation. We are proud of the process that went on in committee. We heard from a host of witnesses who came before the committee. I emphasize that this is not a substitute for consultation; it was about hearing witnesses and their concerns. Out of the 21 or 22 witnesses we heard, only 1 witness supported the legislation in its original form. We heard learned presentations from academics. We heard from leaders in the aboriginal community. We heard from individuals in the aboriginal community. We heard concerns from the men and women who the bill would affect.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123438">We were concerned that there was no interpretive clause. We were concerned that there was no non-derogation clause. We were concerned that there was no attention given to the fiscal capacity. We were most concerned that the transition period was very short. We were also concerned that no study or analysis had been done on the impact the legislation would have on first nations communities. We know an analysis was done on what the impact would be on INAC, but no study was done to determine what the impact would be on first nations communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123439">The amended legislation was a model of cooperation by the opposition parties, listening to the representations we heard from individuals, working together to amend the bill to make it a stronger, fairer bill for aboriginal people in our country.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="50">(1550)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1123440">Many times we heard in the House that we had gutted the bill. Far from it. Misrepresentations were mailed out to every household in my riding, misrepresenting my position and the position of my party as it related to the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123441">We proposed a number of important amendments to the bill. We proposed and passed through committee, a non-derogation clause, an interpretative clause, an extension of the time for implementation for three years. This is important. The government originally proposed six months. It was willing to extend it to 18 months, but not beyond that. I am pleased to see the government has allowed it to go in at three years now.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123442">The implementation period of three years will allow first nations to determine their capacity and to look at the implications. It will allow them to prepare their communities for the actual final implementation of the bill. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123443">As the House may recall, the government tried at one point, through a point of order, to remove the non-derogation clause and the interpretative clause. We are pleased that it has come back with amendments. Although they are not what we would have preferred, we will accept the amended non-derogation and interpretative clauses in the bill. They deal with the intent and the protection of the collective rights of first nations communities. We do, however, prefer the amendments put forward in committee, but as an expression of good faith and a desire to get the bill passed, we will support the amendments put forward by the government.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123444">With the amendments, we would be able to grant human rights to first nations people in a way that balances their collective rights with individual rights as well as maintaining all existing aboriginal and treaty rights, as recognized under section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123445">With respect to the transition period, first nations will now have an adequate amount of time to prepare for the legislation. In doing so, the government will have a chance to properly consult with all affected first nations peoples. I sincerely hope the government will take advantage of the opportunity to do this. I hope it will not just tell them but engage them in a meaningful consultation process whereby it will listen to them and work with them to implement the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123446">Once the bill comes into effect, first nations will work with the government to undertake the extensive preparation, the capacity, fiscal and human resources required. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123447">The important part of this is the amended legislation, and it was amended not without acrimony or without challenge, is an example of parliamentarians working together to fix flawed legislation and amend it to reflect the best interests of first nations people. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123448">As I said at the beginning, the Liberals have always maintained our support for the repeal of this section. It was not done in a way which we supported. Since the bill is now in front of us, we are proud to say that we improved flawed legislation to reflect the views of first nations communities throughout the country. They will be able to work with this legislation, and we are proud to support it.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Crowder" id="2491801"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78928" Type="2">Ms. Jean Crowder (Nanaimo—Cowichan, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1123449">Mr. Speaker, this is an important day in the House as we bring back the amended Bill <Document DbId="3095171" Type="3">C-21</Document>. Specifically, we are dealing with a couple of amendments.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123450"> Unfortunately, this bill has been decades in coming. I will share just a bit of history around this bill. Originally in 1977 an exception was provided that first nations living on reserve could not file complaints under the Canadian Human Rights Act against anything in the Indian Act. Part of the history around that so-called temporary exemption from 1977 being put in place was of course that there were discriminatory provisions in existence in the Indian Act.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123451">One of those discriminatory provisions was around the fact that first nations women who married non-aboriginal men were actually excluded from living on reserve or maintaining their status. The report that came out in 2005 from the Canadian Human Rights Commission, “A Matter of Rights”, talked about the impacts on the community. I have a quote from that report about what happens to families:</ParaText><ParaText id="1123452"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The effect of this discriminatory provision was the effective banishment of over one hundred thousand women, their spouses, and their children from their communities and traditional homelands. This caused great psychological, emotional and economic suffering. This was especially true in cases where marriages broke down and First Nation women were not allowed to return home.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1123453">What we had in place was a system that disenfranchised thousands and thousands of women and their families. Because the department of the day knew this discriminatory provision was in place and was not at that time prepared to deal with that discriminatory provision, it asked for this exemption and it was put in place.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123454">Subsequent to that, this particular part of the Indian Act was repealed and women were granted their status. I am going to come back to that in a minute, because that was Bill C-31 from 1985, which was one of the reasons that so many people who came before committee were so vocal about wanting some of the amendments that were put in place.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123455">I am not going to read all the recommendations from “A Matter of Rights”, but there were five key recommendations. Part of what the Canadian Human Rights Commission recommended in 2005, before legislation was developed, was that consultation take place with first nations and that “an interpretive provision”, which would take into consideration the rights and interests of first nations, be put in place, and that there would be a transitional period of at least 18 to 30 months, and so on. There were a number of other recommendations.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123456">However, part of the challenge that this House and the committee faced was that when the piece of legislation came before the committee, it was of course a very simple piece of legislation and did not include any of those elements. The bill was developed without consultation with first nations communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123457">Therefore, to the Conservative government's surprise, there were a number of concerns raised by witness after witness who came before the committee. People were saying that in the past governments have passed bills in the House that have had some unintended consequences, and they did not want to see that happen.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123458">The committee listened quite respectfully to the witnesses and subsequently proposed a number of amendments, which included an extended transitional period for 36 months. They included an interpretive clause and a non-derogation clause. The amendments we are dealing with today have done some refinement on the non-derogation clause and on some additional wording around gender principles.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123459">I want to come back for a moment to the Canadian Human Rights Commission and why the committee faced some challenges around needing to hear so much more information, because the report of the Canadian Human Rights Act Review Panel, “Promoting Equality: A New Vision”, made a number of specific recommendations with regard to the repeal of section 67.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123460">The panel said specifically,“Any effort to deal with the section 67 issue must ensure adequate input from Aboriginal people themselves”. We saw what happened when that did not happen: it took months for us to get to the place where there was some agreement in getting the bill back in the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123461">The panel talked about resources. To go back to Bill C-31, one thing was very clear in Bill C-31, and in a minute I will quote the Native Women's Association of Canada. What was very clear under Bill C-31 was that there were inadequate resources once women regained their status in their communities. There was not enough housing. There were not enough other support services for women who could have returned to their community. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="00">(1600)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1123462">Therefore, one of the things that the Human Rights Commission recommended was that these resources be put in place. It said that resources must be put in place so that people actually have access to any redress mechanisms that might be deemed suitable once a complaint was filed.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123463"> It talked about the fact that there should be cultural recognition and said:</ParaText><ParaText id="1123464"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">At the same time, the Act should permit a balancing of the values of the Aboriginal people and the need to preserve Aboriginal culture...These points raise huge questions about the social and economic structure of Aboriginal life and its legal underpinnings. Such matters deserve far more study than we have been able to give them. So again, there is a need for adequate consultations.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1123465"> It talked about the balancing provision and stated:</ParaText><ParaText id="1123466"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The Panel believes it is highly important to balance the interests of Aboriginal individuals seeking equality without discrimination with important Aboriginal community interests. A balancing provision means that a Tribunal would actually hear evidence and representations on the issue of whether the interests of the individual and the community are properly balanced.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1123467">It talked about self-government and said:</ParaText><ParaText id="1123468"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The Panel believes something more should be done in order to ensure greater say in the human rights roles that apply to Aboriginal governments. This would be consistent with the principle of self-government.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1123469">Thus, the Canadian Human Rights Commission itself acknowledged the fact that there needed to be a number of other mechanisms put in place in order to make sure that this piece of legislation did not have the same kind of impact that Bill <Document DbId="1266940" Type="3">C-31</Document> has had. Bill C-31 has had some difficulties in terms of the fact that when women were reinstated there were not the resources that I referred to, but there is also a second generation cut-off.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123470"> The second generation cut-off means that people whose parents were not both first nations could end up losing their status by the time the second generation is born. That is an unintended consequence. A report did some analysis on key reserves across the country and did some estimates on when the last status person would be born on those reserves. Some would say that quite cynically the government is not dealing with that provision because then first nations people would come under the guidance of the provinces rather than the federal government.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123471">Bev Jacobs, president of the Native Women's Association of Canada, said in a press release: </ParaText><ParaText id="1123472"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Twenty-five years after having the Charter, NWAC is well aware that having rights on paper does not guarantee the ability of all individuals to exercise those rights. NWAC believes that consultation with Aboriginal peoples and specifically, Aboriginal women, is necessary to ensuring the rights are meaningful and exercisable. We are also well aware that membership provisions under Bill C-31, off-reserve rights, health, housing and education policies as well as the continuing lack of a matrimonial real property law regime that applies on reserve are issues that the federal crown will most likely see complaints filed about.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1123473">She goes on further in that press release to say: </ParaText><ParaText id="1123474"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">--It is important for both the CHRC and First Nations communities to have the resources to build a relationship that acknowledges and respects human rights.” This is the only way equal rights for all can be promised.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1123475">We know that this very important piece of legislation, the repeal of section 67 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which does provide the right for first nations people on reserve to file complaints under discriminatory provisions under the Indian Act, in itself will not guarantee human rights unless there are resources in place.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123476">The Native Women's Association of Canada talked about resources around education and housing. We know, of course, that the children from Attawapiskat are here on the Hill today, talking about how their human rights are being violated by the fact that they do not have access to a school. They do not have access to the education that every other Canadian child off reserve expects as a fundamental human right. When Ms. Jacobs from the Native Women's Association of Canada talks about this, she knows full well that many communities simply do not have those resources that would make sure that their human rights were not violated.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123477">In a brief that the Native Women's Association put forward to the committee on the repeal of section 67 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, it talked about the fact that governments, both the current Conservative government and previous Liberal government, should not have waited so long, and again quotes the Canadian Human Rights Commission, which said: </ParaText><ParaText id="1123478"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">However, the Commission would prefer that the Government take a proactive approach to preventing potential discrimination and not wait for complaints to be filed and potentially lengthy proceedings to take place. The Commission, therefore, urges the Government, in consultation with First Nations, the Commission and other relevant bodies, to review provisions of the Indian Act and relevant policies and programs to ensure that they do not conflict with the Canadian Human Rights Act and other relevant provisions of domestic and international human rights law. Such a review should focus in particular on the impact of Bill C-31....</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1123479">In conclusion, I am very pleased that the House has decided that it would support Bill <Document DbId="3095171" Type="3">C-21</Document>, the repeal of section 67, and I urge the government to ensure that the resources are put in place to deal with potential human rights complaints and also to ensure that the resources are available to the Canadian Human Rights Commission so it can go out and work with first nations governments to ensure this understanding is in place.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Scheer" id="2491931"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="114225" Type="93">The Acting Speaker (Mr. Andrew Scheer)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1123480">Pursuant to order made earlier today, Motions Nos. 1 and 2 are deemed adopted, Bill C-21, an Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act, as amended, is deemed concurred in at report stage with further amendments, and deemed read a third time and passed.</ParaText><ProceduralText TocType="TCC" id="10">(Motions Nos. 1 and 2 agreed to, bill as amended concurred in, read the third time and passed)</ProceduralText></Content></Intervention>

Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1123482">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to the bill dealing with the European free trade agreement with Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123483">The bill is one that started its progression internationally in 1998 when the then government of Mr. Chrétien moved forward on deliberations with our partners and began dealing with this particular issue. The agreement was signed on January 26, 2008, in Switzerland and it was tabled in our Parliament on February 14, 2008.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123484">The purpose of the bill is to eliminate duties on non-agricultural goods and selected agricultural products, giving Canadian exporters better access to Canada's fifth largest merchandise export destination. Many Canadians would find it interesting that the particular destination is a group of northern European countries, including Liechtenstein and Norway.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123485">This particular free trade agreement is one that has broad support. The Liberal Party supports this particular bill. There are some concerns in a few sectors, including shipbuilding, but I think we have worked together quite well to put forth some solutions that would enable our shipbuilders in Canada to find some recourse because the phase-out of tariffs will be over quite a prolonged period of time.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123486">We want to ensure that in Canada we capitalize on our areas of expertise, and one of those is, quite frankly, in the shipbuilding area. On the east coast and west coast of Canada and in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="78343" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</Affiliation>, we have outstanding individuals, fine craftsmen and craftswomen, who work in the shipbuilding industry and provide exceptional products.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123487">Some of those have been built for our Canadian Forces. When Liberals were in government, we commissioned a number of projects, including the Orca class of boats that have been built in my riding of Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca by the shipbuilders there. Quite frankly, the product they have is superb.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123488">My hope is that the government will work with our private sector to ensure that our capabilities will be exported and that those capabilities will find markets in other countries. It would certainly be a fine testament to the exceptional workers that we have in our country, in both eastern and western Canada, who have that ability. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123489">There is one area in shipbuilding in particular that the government may wish to pick up on. We have a tariff on importing ships. A company in Canada that wishes to import a large vessel would pay an import duty. That duty goes into general revenue. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123490">The government would be wise to consider, rather than putting those import duties into general revenue, to put them into a fund that would have to be matched by the private sector, which would double the size of the fund, so that those moneys could be directed toward infrastructure for the shipbuilding industry. The funds spent by the companies could then be recirculated within the shipbuilding industry. The private sector would then know that its import tariffs were going back into the shipbuilding industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123491">Third, it would also increase the bang for the buck because the government would be putting those moneys in to match. The matching funds would share the responsibility between the private sector and the government, so there would be dual responsibility and a dual opportunity for both the private sector and the government to enable the private sector to compete with other shipbuilders, particularly those in northern Europe, who quite frankly have done a pretty good job of developing a fine product and are competing internationally. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123492">However, those countries subsidize their domestic shipbuilding capabilities, and while they do it in certain ways, it is important that our shipbuilders not be under the gun or behind the eight-ball when they are competing with other shipbuilding companies in other parts of the world.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123493">The scope of the bill is very interesting. As I said before, the EFTA countries are the world's fourteenth largest merchandising traders and Canada's fifth largest merchandise export destination. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1123494">The two way Canada-EFTA non-agricultural merchandise trade is, in total, $12.6 billion. Our exports to the EFTA were $5.1 billion last year and our imports were $7.4 billion. Our exports included areas such as the aerospace products industry and I want to take a moment to talk about the MacDonald-Detweiler issue when the government, I think wisely, made the decision to prevent that sale from occurring.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123495">There is a challenge, though. While the MDA sale was quite rightly blocked because Canada and Canadian taxpayers had put more than $500 million into enabling MDA to be a world leader in the aerospace industry and paid for satellites that are some of the best in terms of earth monitoring capabilities, there is another side to this. There are over 1,200 scientists at MDA and unless they have products to sell and be competitive internationally, we will lose those scientists.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123496">It took some 20 years to bring those scientists to Canada and to build and create the capabilities. It is of the utmost urgency that the <Affiliation DbId="111555" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> work with and listen to MDA to find ways to ensure that those scientific capabilities stay within Canada. If we do not, the very real danger is that we will lose that world class capability we have within MDA with the pool of 1,200 scientists to other parts of the world. In particular, we will lose them south of the border to the United States.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123497">This is not something we can wait on for a long period of time. This is something that has to be done quite quickly. I would again urge the <Affiliation DbId="111555" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> or industry officials to meet with MDA officials to determine what we can do to ensure we do not have this loss of very highly skilled, extraordinary individuals.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123498">The other issue I want to talk about is international trade, as this is a trade issue, dealing with the WTO and the Doha round of talks. This is very appropriate given the fact that we have a world food crisis on our hands. It has caused governments to collapse and food riots, and it particularly affects those citizens of our planet who are the poorest and most impoverished in the world. One billion people live on less than $1 a day and 1.5 billion people live on less than $2 a day. Two and a half billion people on our planet live on less than $2 a day. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123499">What happens if our foodstuffs increase 140% in a matter of less than a few months? That is what happened with rice. This year, rice prices have increased 141%. Wheat, sorghum, corn, the staples of life, have increased significantly over the last two years. Some have even increased 25% in a day.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123500">Most of us in our country have been somewhat insulated from the effects of that for various reasons, but for the poorest people in the world, that is not the case. People living on less than $2 a day have a choice between food and sending their children to school, food and having a roof over their heads, or food and health care. Those are the stark choices people would have if they lived in those countries in the world, more than 58, where there is endemic poverty.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123501">The food crisis has not hit us yet in terms of prices but it will. When it hits, it is those Canadians who are least able to afford it who are going to be hurt, people who are single parents with very little money, people making minimum wage or a bit above it, and seniors on fixed incomes who live hand to mouth. The implications of this are quite significant. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123502">What if people have to make choices within food groups? That is how it happens. As prices increase dramatically, people actually have to jettison vital food groups that are important not only for the health of adults but are critical for the development of children.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123503">We know that the deprivation of micronutrients and malnutrition on a developing child is catastrophic. If children are deprived of micronutrients and are malnourished, the developing brain in particular is affected. Malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies create long term cognitive, intellectual and physical disabilities that are permanent. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1123504">Children would grow up to be adults who are less than what they could be. The downstream effects of this are what? The downstream effects are that children who are deprived of micronutrients and are malnourished have long term physical, cognitive and intellectual disabilities that affect them when they are adults. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123505">When they are trying to be employed; go to school; acquire training; live and work; act, behave and interact; all of those are negatively impeded by virtue of the fact of what happened when those individuals were children. Early deprivation has long term, profound implications not only for the individual but for society as a whole. The tragedy of it is that it is entirely preventable.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123506">When we know that, it behooves us to start to tackle this issue in a pragmatic way. Let us talk about some of the antecedents as to why the food crisis is taking place. Demand, to be sure, is going up in countries such as India and China, pushing prices up.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123507">Second, there is the issue of higher energy costs. Energy is required to produce fertilizers. Seeds are becoming more expensive. Availability is down. Biofuel, the conversion of foodstuffs such as corn into ethanol, which is put in our gas tanks, is also a driver to move prices up.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123508">The last and the most pernicious area is the area of trade barriers. There is something we could do that would dramatically ameliorate the effects of food prices and that is the tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade that are dramatically impeding our ability to be able to produce the food that we require.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123509">Imagine that the Doha round and WTO has ground to a halt. It started in 2001, I believe, and it has been sitting there moribund or endlessly going around in one big circle. The countries that are most responsible for this are those that are the richest. The countries that pay the price are those that are the poorest.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123510">Imagine that. We have a world food crisis where some of the poorest people in the world are unable to put food on the table and we, as developed countries that are the richest countries in the world, are actually doing things to prevent people who need food, who live on less than $2 a day to feed their children and themselves.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123511">Why has the government not demanded an emergency series of debates at the WTO to move the Doha round forward and to implement the Doha round of agreements? This is something that our new Conservative government has fallen flat on, among many other things on the international stage. Why has the government not done this, instead of sitting back? Why has the government not taken a leadership role to address this international challenge?</ParaText><ParaText id="1123512">Canada can do this. We can take a role in mobilizing the more than 27 agencies such as the World Bank, FAO, IFAD, WFP, and WTO. All of those organizations, 27 in total, are tasked with a responsibility to deal with food issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123513">Canada can make a profound impact at the WTO. Canada needs to get our diplomats behind this. There has to be a sense of urgency that has to come from the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office. The Prime Minister has to tell our highly competent diplomats to move this forward and get the job done. They have to get the Doha round of agreements completed and mobilize this with our international colleagues.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123514">On the development stage, we have heard very little. In fact, we have heard nothing on this. Moneys were given. A good thing the government did was to not tie the aid and I compliment it for that. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123515">The amount of money given by the government was $50 million more than last year, but prices have increased by 40% plus for the demands that the World Food Programme is trying to meet. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123516">We have an increased demand but we also have increased costs. As a result, the amount of money that we are actually putting forward on this is not even able to keep up with the increases in prices. This is something that is unconscionable.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1123517">What else can happen? As I said before, some 500 million small landholders live on less than a hectare. About a tonne of foodstuffs, grain and basic products can be derived from a hectare. We know what we could do. Jeffrey Sachs from Columbia University has made some very eloquent interventions. We could double or even triple the output from these small landholders, who are some of the poorest people in the world. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123518">Imagine if Canada were to tap into some of the extraordinary research available in the International Development Research Centre and other areas in Canada to deal with the issues of better seed quality, better access to fertilizer and markets and better agricultural practices, water security and irrigation techniques. That combination could be used quite significantly to triple the output of foodstuffs from small landholders. What a remarkable thing we could do if Canada were to take up that leadership role. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123519">I would be remiss if I did not draw attention to two areas of excellence within CIDA. One is the micronutrient initiative in which Canada plays a leadership role. I urge the government to work with the <Affiliation DbId="111559" Type="4">Minister of International Cooperation</Affiliation> and other partners to support this initiative because micronutrient deficiencies have a profound impact on developing children.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123520">CIDA has discovered high protein, high caloric, high energy bars. The government could work in this area as well because these bars would be effective during a food crisis. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123521">I also want to talk about food security and, in particular, the fisheries issue. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123522">A good chunk of the world relies on fish for food because it is an important source of protein. Ninety per cent of world fish species have been removed from the oceans, particularly large fish species like tuna and shark. This is a catastrophe. Our oceans are dying. Dr. Sylvia Earle from Woods Hole in Massachusetts has done an excellent job of articulating this. She calls it the dying oceans. Why is the government not dealing with this catastrophe? </ParaText><ParaText id="1123523">I will give the House an example. As draggers fish, they destroy the beds upon which fish reproduce. Draggers are horrible, destructive elements in fishing and they are creating an environmental catastrophe. If Canada were to work with our partners to ban dragging, that would go some way toward addressing the problem of our dying oceans. The reason I mention this is because this is part of international trade agreements and trade negotiations. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123524">We have heard nothing from the government on all these issues. We have given the government a number of constructive solutions on which it could act. It could act on the food crisis. It could act through international development and trade. The government could ensure that Canadians are not going to be affected by the storms that are wafting over the world right now. So far we have been somewhat protected, but that is not going to exist much longer.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123525">These are big international issues that demand international action. Our country can act with authority and knowledge. I implore the government to demonstrate some leadership and do this for our citizens and for the world.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Chong" id="2492204"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78583" Type="2">Hon. Michael Chong (Wellington—Halton Hills, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1123526">Mr. Speaker, I am glad the member has spoken to the European Free Trade Association agreement with Canada. As he is well aware, it is an agreement between the Government of Canada and EFTA, which is a bloc of four countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, to implement a bilateral trade agreement between us and those four countries. It is a bloc of countries that is made up of about 12 million citizens. It is a good trade deal because it is a free trade deal with countries that have similar or even higher labour and environmental standards as compared to Canada's. It is a step in the right direction.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123527"> I note that this is in Europe. The big trading bloc in Europe is the European Union, an area of about 27 countries and close to 500 million citizens.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123528">What does the member think the Government of Canada needs to do in order to conduct a trade agreement with the European Union? The real future opportunity for Canadian trade, for Canadian business and for Canadian society is under a free trade agreement with the wider European Union, as I mentioned before, a trading bloc. It is one of the largest trading blocs in the world, made up of close to half a billion citizens and 27 member states. What does the member think we need to do as a country, as a government, to move that sort of trade deal along now that we have the first building block of a free trade agreement with the EFTA?</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca)" id="2492237"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78343" Type="2">Hon. Keith Martin</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1123529">Mr. Speaker, my colleague has hit on a very intriguing challenge for the reasons he has mentioned, in terms of the size of the existing population. He also knows there are enormous barriers within that bloc, particularly in terms of the trade subsidies, the tariff and non-tariff barriers, that exist within the European Union and between the European Union and us.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123530"> I submit that there are two channels we could take.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123531"> One is to pursue it through negotiations, but be very certain that our domestic producers will not be harmed. Critical to that and incumbent upon the European Union is to remove the tariff and non-tariff barriers that so far have created tremendous price distorting issues, not only in the agricultural sector but also the non-agricultural merchandise sector too.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123532">The second channel is we move to the WTO. The member knows I have a particular passion, and I know he does too, in dealing with the Doha round of talks. It is unfathomable I think to most of us to see the intransigence on the part of the Europeans in trying to move forward with something that will help the most impoverished in our world. The failure to complete the Doha round is self-defeating. In the absence of moving through Doha and in the absence of completing these talks, we affect negatively the very security that we are trying to deal with not only in Afghanistan but also in other parts of the world. The failure to complete Doha creates insecurity in some of the most impoverished parts of the world, which ultimately will come to address us in terms of insecurity.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123533">I will close by one point. Maybe the area in which we can attract our European friend on this is the issue of immigration to Europe from other parts of the world that are quite poor and the effect that has in its own countries. They are deeply concerned by the immigration issue. If they were able to go and complete Doha, then a lot of the people who would go to their countries, seeking simply a better and more secure life, as any of us would do, would not happen.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123534">Therefore, the carrot for the European countries would be diminished immigration. A lot of the immigration challenges and racial issues within Europe would be defused. They would also be providing security in areas that have been a source of terrorist activity and insecurity for Europe.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Scheer" id="2492274"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="114225" Type="93">The Acting Speaker (Mr. Andrew Scheer)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1123535">Is the House ready for the question?</ParaText><ParaText id="1123536"><B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123537"><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Andrew Scheer):</B> The question is on the motion.

I think that all members are going to be interested in it. I would encourage all of them, as I said, to support it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123550">I want to mention that the Standing Committee on Natural Resources did a great job in dealing with this bill. There was a very positive study of the bill by the committee and the bill was reported back to this House without amendment. We certainly appreciate the work the members of the committee put into their study of Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123551">Canada's nuclear safety record is second to none in the world. We have a robust technology, we have a well-trained workforce, and we have stringent regulatory requirements.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123552">There are two pieces of legislation that provide a solid framework for regulating the industry in Canada. Those are the Nuclear Safety and Control Act and the Nuclear Fuel Waste Act.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123553">Responsibility for providing an insurance framework, that is, a framework to protect Canadians and to provide stability in this important industry, falls under federal jurisdiction. The Government of Canada has the duty to assume its responsibilities in this area, and through this bill it is doing just that.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123554">Canada, like virtually all other nuclear countries, addresses this responsibility with the enactment of special legislation. In Canada, we have put in place the Nuclear Liability Act. That act was passed years ago. Bill C-5 modernizes the Nuclear Liability Act. It does so by doing a number of different things. It brings the compensation levels into line with internationally accepted compensation levels. It expands the categories of compensable damage. It improves the compensation procedures and the way people make claims. It increases the financial liability of nuclear operators.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123555">Up to date rules are needed to provide certainty regarding insurance and legal liability for suppliers, operators and the general public. Without this certainty, Canada would not be able to attract leading international firms and suppliers of technology in the nuclear industry. Of course, it could be argued that Canada's current legislation more or less accomplishes these objectives. Therefore, the question needs to be asked, why do we need new legislation when we already have a serviceable act in place? The simple answer is, as I mentioned, that the current act is outdated. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123556">The Nuclear Liability Act was passed in 1970. In terms of today's nuclear technology, that is the middle ages. Several lifetimes of nuclear and related technologies have come and gone since then. In short, Canada's existing Nuclear Liability Act reflects the technology, the science and the thinking of an earlier period.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123557">In the interim, it is not only the technology of nuclear energy that has advanced considerably, but the evolution of jurisprudence has contributed to substantial increases in potential liability. Therefore, the government has made the decision, and Canadians are supporting it, that our legislation must be upgraded.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123558">There are, of course, certain fundamental principles of the 1970 act that must be retained. These include absolute liability, exclusive liability and mandatory insurance. I would like to take a couple of minutes to explain what those terms mean, because I know everyone in the House is very interested in them and fascinated by them.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123559">Absolute liability means that the operator of a nuclear facility will be held liable for compensating victims in the rare case of a nuclear incident. This means that victims would not have to negotiate with a highly complex industry in order to determine who is at fault. There would be no question of where to take a claim for compensation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123560">A second and related principle, exclusive liability, means that no other party other than the operator, for example, no supplier or subcontractor, would be held liable. This removes the risk that would deter secondary enterprises from becoming involved in nuclear projects.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123561">To modernize our liability scheme, we must have legislation that goes farther, although retaining certain fundamental principles. That is what Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document> does.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123562">The proposed legislation increases the limit of liability for nuclear operators. The current liability act sets the maximum at $75 million. That amount was substantial when it was set, but now stands as one of the lowest limits among the G-8 group of nations.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123563">The proposed legislation reflects the conditions of today by raising that limit to $650 million. This balances the need for operators to provide adequate compensation without burdening them with huge costs for unrealistic insurance amounts, or impossible insurance amounts, for events that are highly unlikely to occur in this country. Moreover, this increase puts Canada on a par with most western nuclear countries. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1123564">Bill C-5 also increases the mandatory insurance that operators must carry by almost ninefold. It permits operators to cover half of their liability with forms of financial security other than insurance. This has been an important provision for the industry. These could, for example, be things like letters of credit, self-insurance, and provincial, or in the case of Atomic Energy of Canada, federal guarantees. All operators would be required to conform to strict guidelines in this area. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123565">Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document> makes Canada's legislation consistent with international conventions. It does so not only with respect to financial matters, but it also does so with clearer definitions of nuclear damage reflecting today's legal and international nuclear civil liability conventions. These definitions include crucial matters as to what constitutes a nuclear accident, what damages do or do not qualify for compensation, and so on. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123566">These enhancements will place Canadian nuclear firms on a level playing field with competitors in other countries.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123567">Bill C-5 also makes changes to the time period for making claims. Under the act that was passed in 1970, claims had to be brought forward within 10 years of the incident. However, the proposed legislation raises the time limit on compensation for claims to 30 years. Both the earlier Nuclear Liability Act and Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document> provide for an administrative process that will operate faster than the courts in the adjudication. However, the proposed legislation clarifies what the arrangements for the quasi-judicial tribunal must be in order to hear those claims. This new process will ensure that claims are handled both equitably and efficiently.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123568">There has been a lot of debate about some of these proposed measures. For example, there has been discussion about how and why the government arrived at the $650 million amount. Questions have been raised as to other international practices and what goes on in other countries. We believe the $650 million liability limit will adequately address any foreseeable incident in a Canadian nuclear power plant.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123569">Although the U.S. operator liability is cited as $10 billion Canadian, in practice, individual U.S. operators effectively carry $300 million Canadian in primary insurance coverage. A few countries, namely Germany, Switzerland and Japan, do incorporate unlimited liability to the operator under the provisions of their nuclear civil liability legislation. However, in practice, that liability is always limited to the amount of coverage provided by existing insurance plus the net worth of the operator that is liable.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123570">Questions have been raised as to how the $650 million liability limit will stay modern. It is important to note that the $650 million limit set out in Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document> can be increased by regulation, and that limit needs to be reviewed at least every five years. This review will examine changes in the consumer price index and international trends, but will have the flexibility to take into consideration any other criteria that is deemed appropriate.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123571">We have made the argument, and Canadians have accepted it, that this is a proper limit in order to ensure that we have the nuclear liability amounts that we need.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123572">The challenge for the government in developing this legislation was how to be fair to all stakeholders and to strike an effective balance in the public interest. In developing Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document>, we consulted with nuclear operators, suppliers, insurers, the provinces with nuclear installations, as well as the public. They generally support the changes that I have described.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123573">I know that some nuclear operators may be concerned about cost implications for higher insurance premiums, but they also recognize that the current levels have been outdated. Suppliers welcome the changes as they provide more certainty for the industry. Nuclear insurers appreciate the clarity provided in the new legislation and the resolution of some long-standing issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123574">Provinces with nuclear facilities have been supportive of the proposed revisions to the current legislation. Municipalities that host nuclear facilities have been advocating revisions to the Nuclear Liability Act for some time. They are supportive of the increased levels of operator liability and improved approaches to victim compensation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123575">In short, Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document> was not developed in isolation. The evolution of policy was guided by consultations with key stakeholders and by experiences gained in other countries. The reality is that we have general support of the industry at large for Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document>. I would urge the members of the House to join in that consensus.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123576">To conclude, Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document> establishes the compensation and civil liability regime to address damages resulting from radiation in the unlikely event of a radioactive release from a Canadian nuclear installation. It ensures that a proper compensation program is in place and channels civil liability to operators.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1123577">The introduction of Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document> adds to this government's track record of making responsible decisions on the safe, long term future of nuclear power in Canada.

There are two incidents that I will point out on which I think we have had liabilities or currently have liabilities.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123584">I wonder to what extent this piece of legislation restricts the federal government's liability with respect to the nuclear industry.

There was a study of what level of compensation needed to be put in place in order to deal with whatever situation might arise. The former amount was $75 million. It was felt that $650 million was a good requirement in order to cover any incident that may occur in this country. That is why that number was picked.

Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document>, the nuclear liability bill, is an important bill. It is a culmination of years of examination and review of the old bill and is a concise overhaul of the old bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123609">I want to take this opportunity to echo what the parliamentary secretary said earlier. I want to thank members of the natural resources committee for their diligent work in reviewing the bill, for listening to various stakeholders and for offering constructive discussion throughout our hearings. I also want to thank the officials at Natural Resources Canada for their diligent work and for offering an insightful presentation of the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123610">This is an administrative bill that overhauls the 1970 act . It offers new and tighter definitions, clearer objectives, a new liability limit and defines financial security. It also proposes a new tribunal for claims. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123611">We heard throughout our study that Bill C-5 was very much needed for the industry and for Canadians. Nuclear suppliers, host communities, independent professors and stakeholders offered our committee very comprehensive thoughts on the bill. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123612">While there were many legitimate questions about what the limit should be, what type of financial security there should be and how the tribunal should be structured, the overall consensus was that the bill was needed. Host communities, industry and many Canadians are waiting for it. We will be supporting the bill as presented to the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123613">However, I cannot miss the opportunity to speak about the nuclear energy situation in our country. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123614">Earlier this year we witnessed a lot of issues with respect to Atomic Energy and the government's management of AECL. We had a national health crisis when the NRU reactor at Chalk River was shut down because of a licensing issue. As a result, we had a severe shortage of nuclear isotopes. Many Canadians, in fact many citizens around the world who depend on the supply of isotopes, were left scrambling for alternative medicine. Some people had their appointments or examinations delayed. I remember the minister at the time saying that many lives were at stake, and I agreed with his comments. Many lives were at stake.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123615">That problem resulted from the Conservative government's mismanagement of the situation. The fiasco was blamed on the Canadian nuclear safety regulator who was doing her job. The government accused her of partisanship. It claimed to consult independent experts, who, by the way, happened to either be a Conservative or a former AECL employee. Rather than address the root cause of the problem, which was the shortage of isotopes, the government placed the blame exclusively on someone else and, in fact, ended up firing her without any justification.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123616">It is important to raise this issue today because we were just reminded of this a week ago when the government again showed its incompetence by announcing that it would stop the MAPLE reactors, which were supposed to replace the old NRU reactor that produces isotopes, without providing Canadians with a plan on how the supply of isotopes will be supplemented.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1123617">In December of last year, Canadians witnessed what could happen if the NRU reactor were to go out of production: severe shortages that could potentially cost Canadian lives. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123618">The minister, after hiding for a month and getting training from a media consultant, told Canadians that he had to fire the nuclear regulator because Canadian lives were at stake. Now he has the gall to say that the government will end the project of replacing the NRU reactor and that we should not worry about it because everything is under control. By the way, we do have a 30 year contract to supply isotopes but we will keep the 50-year-old reactor to produce those isotopes.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123619">Any reasonable observer can be forgiven for not trusting the government's word on having any sense of reliability or competent management of the situation. If the government had presented a plan at the time of its announcement of shutting down the MAPLE project, it would have been excused for its decision. However, the fact that it has announced that it will no longer pursue the MAPLE reactor but has offered no real plan to supplement the production of isotopes, leaves those questions in the minds of many Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123620">I would not be doing my job here today if I did not ask those questions and raise those points. My Conservative colleagues cannot disagree with me. At the time, supposedly they justified the firing because lives were at stake. Now they cannot claim that there is no risk involved here.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123621">There is another issue here. The Conservatives are secretly considering the privatization of AECL but they are not sharing their plans with Canadians. They are not telling us what they are working on. Instead, they want to do the write-off of the MAPLE reactors on the backs of taxpayers so that if they want to privatize it, taxpayers will pay for that write-off.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123622">It is important that the government, the <Affiliation DbId="78751" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> and his parliamentary secretary tell us here today what their plans are for AECL. It is not just important for me. It is important for Canadians. It is important for the Ontario government, which is looking to hire AECL to build a nuclear reactor, but right now the Ontario government is skeptical about the future of AECL because the federal government has said nothing about it. There are jobs at stake and talent at risk. We need to know what the Conservative government plans to do with AECL.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123623">I do not think anybody can attack me for asking these questions. This is my job. This is what Canadians are asking for and the Conservatives are failing Canadians. They are not explaining what they are doing. They are not assuring us that they are worried about nuclear safety. They are not telling us that they concerned about the supply of isotopes. In fact, they are not even telling us what their plan is for the future of nuclear energy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123624">We know that nuclear energy has a bright future, not just in Canada but around the world. We know that AECL has a wealth of talent, people with high degrees of experience and education that have been inventing and creating products unparalleled around the world and they deserve an honest answer from the government. They need to know what the future holds for them. They need to know what the government plans to do. The Conservatives need to do it transparently, apolitically and publicly. They cannot do it in secret.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123625">I want to take this opportunity here today to urge the government to consult publicly and share with us its plans for AECL. Again, future projects depend on it, jobs depend on it and our nuclear energy future depends on it.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Anderson" id="2492733"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="113993" Type="18">Mr. David Anderson (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources and for the Canadian Wheat Board, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1123626">Mr. Speaker, I am glad to have the opportunity to respond.

When we worked through this process, it actually was quite positive. I believe our common goal to protect Canadians and enhance protection on this issue was really foremost in our minds and indeed the world. There is no doubt that when legislation is proposed on nuclear viability, many people are watching to see what our nation is going to do and how effective it will be. When there is a chance to make better legislation, we always hope that it is.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123643">What happened during the course of this debate is probably quite strange to many of us because it seems that the government has been reluctant to provide the confidence needed to satisfy Canadians that our reactors are completely safe.

I certainly believe that the mechanisms, structures and processes for safety are in place, and that the Canadian nuclear industry provides the highest standard of safety. Indeed, it is a selling point for us internationally.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123645">I am hoping, as the viewing public watches this debate, that the isotope shortage scandal does not confuse the public in terms of the goals and objectives of this bill. Clearly, the industry needs and wants this. We went through a very long and comprehensive list of witnesses, scientific groups, citizen representatives, environmental organizations, people who understand the industry from many components, and communities which are affected directly. When we make legislation such as this, we want to make sure that people are consulted.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123646"> Indeed, on the question of the adequacy of limits, as someone who has a background in commercial insurance, it is always an interesting question about how much insurance could one really have. From a sales standpoint, many people would think that we are always encouraging people to buy more just for its own sake, but eventually we have to get to a point where we can set a limit and feel confident that in the very remotest possibility of an accident that the compensation level would be adequate and that people would be in the situation they were before the accident.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123647">It was a fascinating debate when other components were added: offshore, water transportation, airborne contaminants, and transportation disruptions. My impression from those witnesses observing the legislation, as they compared our proposed legislation to other countries, was that this bill would come out very good compared to much of the rest of the planet where others have actually gone to the stage of providing such liability. After all the intensive questioning it seemed that as we tried to address this, it was to a large extent overshadowed by the isotope shortage issue.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1123648">We on the committee realized that it could have been averted. With proper planning and arrangements internationally with other countries, there would not have been the need for a knee-jerk reaction, which of course disturbs the entire country and everyone feels it was the industry that was at fault as opposed to the government. Was it handled incompetently? It is now pretty obvious. The vast majority of Canadians would agree with that.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123649">Were there people making presentations who had a partisan bias? That of course clouded the issue to some extent. As it continues, we know that the isotope issue has to be addressed in a much more open and consultative process. Here we are close to June. We had the hearings in January and the report to Parliament has been delayed through some other work but also because of an extremely long process for a forestry report. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123650">Parliament should have had the report on the isotope issue already. Hopefully there will be enough time to address that and table it in Parliament before the summer adjournment. Otherwise, it appears that the committee may be meeting during the humidity days of July. Can we get to that report in common cause for the common good? I truly hope that all members of the committee are on the same wavelength for that. I am speaking in good faith.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123651">Rainy River, of course, is part of <Affiliation DbId="78979" Type="2">Thunder Bay—Rainy River</Affiliation>. For those who may not be aware, my riding is seven and a half hours long over two time zones. Imagine driving to a community such as that over the Victoria Day weekend and hearing an announcement that there is going to be a shutdown of the program. I ask, as many people do who are tuned in to this, why would the government do it on the Victoria Day weekend? What confidence should I get from this? Is this not strange?</ParaText><ParaText id="1123652">The media reaction, of course, was that it was very shocked. It undermines public faith. When we tell them we are striving to have the highest possible standards for an industry, it certainly gives fuel to critics who may have their own biases about the nuclear industry, so that we actually undermine confidence as opposed to some form of open media or press release at a time when people can respond to it. It is hard to imagine that something would happen at that time of day over that kind of weekend and people would not suspect a hidden agenda.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123653">When Canadians want to know what lies in the future for the nuclear industry, we should be able to overcome unfair reaction. We should be able to debate the entire future of energy, energy supply, energy demand, and how Canadians will meet their needs in the future. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123654">Where does nuclear fit in all of this? In my riding of <Affiliation DbId="78979" Type="2">Thunder Bay—Rainy River</Affiliation>, there are two coal plants. I want to let people know that we want clean coal as an alternative energy. We want to be part of the program for energy where nuclear fits. This is where this bill helps. Do we need a national plan? I believe we do. It is only fair. Canadians need the reassurance. It is needed internationally for our sales of Candu products and it means that not only Canadians but the entire world has to feel confident in us.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Chong" id="2492877"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78583" Type="2">Hon.

Knock wood, all the members in the Standing Committee on Natural Resources work earnestly, professionally and even passionately. We have just concluded a study on forestry during which we discovered the talents, passions and especially the skills of the members of our committee, which enriched our debates.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123673">Unfortunately, in the debate on Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document>, we did not have any specialists in insurance or nuclear liability. We truly had to listen very carefully together to all the witnesses and all the legislative staff who advised us and explained certain things.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123674">We also heard from mayors. Those were the testimonies that touched me the most. There is an association that consists of the mayors of all cities that have nuclear power plants, who have joined together to be represented. We heard from one mayor who told us she was truly pleased with the bill, but that she was surprised and even disappointed that the bill allowed for just $650 million in compensation. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123675">Perhaps we should remind those watching us on television that the purpose of Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document> is to modernize an existing law that has been obsolete and neglected for over 30 years. The bill is intended to meet international standards on nuclear liability. This bill explains the responsibility of operators regarding nuclear liability, sets compensation at a maximum of $650 million, and creates a tribunal to hear claims in the event of a nuclear incident.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123676">After much debate, everyone agrees that $650 million is a clear improvement over the current provisions. With the resurgence of nuclear power, we all agree that $75 million was not enough. Nonetheless, some concerns remain. We are reassured by the fact that the minister or the government will be able, every five years, to increase the amount of compensation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123677"> It was pure negligence. For 30 years and from government to government, whether Liberal or Conservative, this legislation and the compensation should have been updated but were completely neglected. It was only recently that they started paying attention on the heels of a recommendation from the Environmental Commissioner who told us in his 2005 report that we had a real problem in Canada because our nuclear liability was not up to the international standards and that it was really starting to be problematic. It was certainly a problem for our citizens and communities, as well as our companies and operators. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123678"> We will support Bill <Document DbId="3083641" Type="3">C-5</Document> in order to ensure that our communities have better coverage and better tools to defend themselves in case of nuclear incidents. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123679"> We heard some pretty impressive witnesses and got sound advice from all the partners and expert stakeholders. A bill dealing with insurance is necessarily very technical and legalistic and we needed to hear some especially good witnesses. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123680"> The only nuclear power plant in Quebec is located near the town of Gentilly and there was an incident here recently that could have been serious, but fortunately was not. That leads me once again to say that if this incident had actually had repercussions, we would have had to rely on this old legislation providing the citizens of Gentilly with only $75 million in compensation.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="30">(1730)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1123681"> We must understand that if there had been a very serious incident, there would have been consequences not just for Gentilly but the entire area, the cities and suburbs all around. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123682"> I want to emphasize that we in the Bloc Québécois are not satisfied with the $650 million amount, especially as the bill provides that the amounts will rise from $75 million to $650 million over four years. This will not happen at once and will take four years. To us and our citizens and communities, this may seem a long time, and quite rightly so. The operators also have some fears about the increase in their premiums over such a short time. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123683"> We worked very hard on this bill in committee and discussed the issues using all the procedures that the House provides us to really get a handle on it. We can be proud of what we accomplished. We worked in an atmosphere in which we all focused on the task at hand and the positive effects rather than partisan politics. There is still no doubt, though, that there are problems with the entire nuclear issue in Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123684">I made a short list of nuclear-related events that occurred in the past year and were of concern not only to the government but to all parliamentarians in this House. You may be surprised by this list.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123685">First, as you know—and I believe the opposition members pointed it out—the isotope shortage and the mismanagement of this crisis by Atomic Energy Canada caused many problems and raised many questions. Although the government may not have said so outright, by initiating a study on what happened between Atomic Energy Canada and the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission it has, in fact, acknowledged that there were serious management and communication problems at play in this crisis.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123686">What we learn from bad experiences helps us to avoid the next crisis. However, when looking at the chronology, it is surprising to note the extent to which Atomic Energy Canada was disorganized. There are questions to be asked.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123687">During this crisis, Ms. Keen, the president of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, was fired. There was also the matter of the current study of Atomic Energy Canada. When he appeared before our committee, the <Affiliation DbId="78751" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> did not hesitate to say that the partial or full privatization of Atomic Energy Canada is among the solutions and recommendations that will very likely be retained. We had our suspicions. He was quite forthcoming, if I remember correctly, when he last appeared.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123688">Furthermore, costs always increase by millions of dollars. As members and party critics for a given file, when analyzing the budgets of each department, we talk in terms of millions of dollars. I have been a member of Parliament for two and a half years. What I have seen, every time, is that millions of dollars are added to the nuclear file, for security, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission or Atomic Energy Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123689">This year, we are talking about $300 million: $80 million to make Chalk River safer and $100 million to further develop the ACR-1000 reactor. We can certainly ask questions, because that is a lot of money. Furthermore, they say nuclear energy is clean energy—I do not agree—but very costly energy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123690">The <Affiliation DbId="78751" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> often tells me that nuclear energy is a provincial option. He knows that I am an MP who keeps a close eye on federal and provincial areas of jurisdiction. There we agree. But nuclear safety and waste management are federal responsibilities. For a year, there has been a lot of spending and a lot of studies, but it is not very clear where the government is headed. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1123691">I am not a strong proponent of nuclear energy, and as a taxpayer, I find it very disturbing to see these millions of dollars going to institutions such as Atomic Energy Canada, even though we do not really know what direction the government wants to take, nor how much money will be needed to achieve the objectives of making Chalk River safer and developing the ACR-1000 reactor. It would be especially important to find out how much we need to invest to upgrade the reactor that produces medical isotopes in Chalk River. As an aside, this reactor is 50 years old and is at the end of its life span. We can modernize it and make all the upgrades we want, but it still has a finite life span.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123692">What solution and plan does the government propose? We recently learned that the government was terminating the MAPLE reactor project. That in itself is not actually news, since it had already been announced on May 16. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123693">We know that taxpayers provided an initial investment of $146 million in this project. Apart from that initial amount, no one really knows how much taxpayers have invested since 1996 in the MAPLE reactor research and development project. We do not know how much it all cost, in the end. We do know, however, that the project was abandoned because it was considered a money pit and it was believed that it could never be completed. We learned this officially on May 16, 2008.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123694">I am personally involved in activities that often bring together major players in nuclear energy. Behind the scenes, everyone knew that MAPLE was doomed to fail and that, clearly, the government failed to realize this fact quickly and in a transparent manner. We are especially concerned about what will replace the reactor that has now reached the end of its existence.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123695">To top it off, we learned from the front page of today's <I>La Presse</I> that, through access to information, a journalist was able to get a document produced by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. That document reveals that the commission is worried that it does not have sufficient financial and human resources to fulfill its role and ensure the security of Quebeckers and Canadians, in short, to carry out the mission that is its raison d'être. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123696">This is somewhat surprising, while the current government touts nuclear energy as the solution to environmental problems and greenhouse gas emissions across Canada. In any case, we have a Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission that admits that it does not have sufficient financial and human resources to carry out its mission and guarantee Quebeckers and Canadians that all operators and facilities comply with and meet international safety standards.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123697">The document reveals one quite impressive fact, namely, that the commission has had to quadruple its security budget.

I will come back to this amendment later.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123714">Finally, the bill would amend the Corrections and Conditional Release Act so that victims’ interests are taken into account during the conditional release process. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123715">The bill introduced by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78536" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville</Affiliation> deserves to be studied further because it contains both positive and negative aspects. I will start by presenting the negative aspects of this bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123716">First, the bill proposes tougher mandatory minimum sentences for offenders. Here again, we see the Conservative Party's mantra: impose mandatory minimum sentences. The Bloc Québécois does not necessarily support that. That way of thinking is harmful in the sense that there are no identical crimes, just as there are no identical offenders or identical circumstances. As such, minimum sentences can often be detrimental.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123717">This would also have a negative impact on the freedom of the judge who must assess circumstances that differ from case to case. It is important to understand that the context of each crime must be considered in order to hand down an appropriate sentence. Imposing mandatory minimum sentences would needlessly tie judges' hands. When judges sentence an offender to prison, they take into account the offender's degree of responsibility, the seriousness of the offence, and the best way to serve justice while increasing the likelihood of rehabilitation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123718">A closer look reveals that section 90 of the Criminal Code already sets out a maximum 10-year sentence for individuals who commit crimes involving concealed weapons, whether knives or guns. A maximum sentence has been established. Of course, the judge is free to consider the circumstances and the individual's record. In some cases, a minimum sentence may not necessarily be appropriate. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123719">Furthermore, heavier minimum sentences do not necessarily dissuade people from committing crimes. Recently, I was saying that would-be offenders decide against committing crimes because of the likelihood of being caught and charged, not because of the sentence they might receive. Also, it is hard to believe that an individual would read the Criminal Code before committing a crime in order to choose a crime that carries a lighter sentence.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123720">Once again, prevention is the only proven way to proceed. Quebec is a good example that proves that prevention and rehabilitation produce results: we have a lower crime rate than anywhere else in North America.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123721"> Nonetheless, Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> includes aspects that merit much more thought in terms of their effects. Incidentally, when we are talking about considering the question of eligibility for parole, the idea that the interests of victims have to be taken into account and forums provided for doing that is not bad in itself. Of course, the principle should be examined together with a number of other factors. Nonetheless, the principle does merit, if not adoption, a thorough examination as part of a more comprehensive study.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123722"> Regarding parole, on June 15 my party made a number of reasonable suggestions about parole to respond to all of the members of the public who would like to have a more balanced system, one that is better suited to the new social reality, that has a real influence on crime, but without the ideological hard line taken by the Conservatives.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123723"> One of our proposals was to eliminate what is now virtually automatic parole after serving one-sixth of the sentence, to remedy some of the bizarre and most often criticized situations, such as sentences for economic crimes, for example, that result in imprisonment for only a few months.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="20">(1820)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1123724"> Similarly, we proposed that we end the virtually automatic statutory release that occurs after an inmate has served two-thirds of his or her sentence, by instituting a formal assessment of inmates by a professional to determine the overall risk of recidivism that they present for the community.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123725"> These are only a few examples among many where the Bloc Québécois has eloquently demonstrated that it is actively responsive to the needs of Quebeckers in relation to the justice system. And this brings me to the second point in Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> that deserves consideration.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123726"> The bill proposes that only time “spent in pre-trial custody is credited toward a term of imprisonment”. To be clear on this, section 719 of the Criminal Code provides that before determining sentence, a judge may deduct two days for each day spent in custody before trial from the final sentence imposed on the offender. It therefore creates a double time phenomenon which, in my view, brings the administration of justice into disrepute. It is also very exasperating for the victims and their families, who sometimes see offenders released within a short time after committing their crimes. At the least, days spent in custody before sentence should still count, but as straight time only.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123727">Thus, Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> would establish that in all cases, the credit granted would be calculated on the basis of one day of imprisonment for each day spent in pre-trial custody. Furthermore, the credit would not be granted to individuals who are being held by reason of previous convictions or as a result of the review or revocation of an order to release the person.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123728">This is an interesting proposal and one the Bloc Québécois supports. I remind members that this idea was in our constructive approach to justice matters unveiled last year. The people of Quebec know this: we are not a silent opposition. We, the Bloc Québécois, are pragmatic and can keep things in perspective when it comes to introducing good practices in order to fight crime more effectively and ensuring that the public has confidence in their justice system.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123729">In conclusion, in light of the arguments I have presented in this House, Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> in its current form has some positive aspects and some negative ones. However, minimum penalties and their negative effects that have been discussed many times in connection with previous bills are not the solution to help Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> meet its objectives. Consequently, like my Bloc colleagues, I will not support the bill of the member for <Affiliation DbId="78536" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123730">Let us be clear. I never once doubted the member's desire to better protect the public. We have all directly or indirectly been witnesses to incidents involving concealed weapons. But as I was saying, there are already provisions in the Criminal Code, and I think we should make more use of them.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="25">(1825)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Storseth" id="2493237"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78932" Type="2">Mr. Brian Storseth (Westlock—St. Paul, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1123731">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to offer my comments today in support of Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document>, introduced by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78536" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123732">Like him and many members of this House on both sides, I have serious concerns about the way our criminal justice system is functioning. Like other members, dissatisfaction or perception of general dissatisfaction with the justice system in Canada is a sentiment I hear expressed regularly by my constituents of Westlock—St. Paul.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123733">As we have heard, Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> contains three general issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123734"> The first deals with sentencing for crimes involving carrying deliberately concealed weapons and homicides committed with a knife in defined circumstances.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123735">The second deals with increasing the discretion of the National Parole Board to provide relevant information to victims and to prevent abuse through offender adjournment of parole hearings.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123736">The third area, which I wish to address today in greater detail, deals with clarifying the discretion available to sentencing judges in calculating what credit, and indeed what extra credit, should be given to persons who have been denied bail prior to their sentencing. While these are clearly distinct areas of criminal procedure, they have a common feature of dealing with systematic discretion in one fashion or another.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1123737">In the imposition of mandatory minimum sentences, the bill clearly is replacing the lower end of the discretionary sentencing range with a minimum sentence. Quite literally, this bill says to sentencing courts that at least a specified custodial sentence must be imposed, and that, of course, is a partial elimination of an existing judicial discretion. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123738">There are dozens of like provisions throughout the Criminal Code, so its use is nothing new. However, its application to these offences is new. I should add that the choice of mandatory minimum sentences by Parliament has recently been confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada in the Ferguson case.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123739">In the area of enhancing victim rights, Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> actually increases the discretionary power of justice system officials responsible for decision making at the National Parole Board. This is an important point to make, as rather than issue a blanket entitlement to any and all offender information, Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> carefully weaves that outcome into defined relevance and discretion through the parole board.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123740">The third area of the bill deals with what has come to be known as pretrial custody credits. Before analyzing this further, I should point out that this term comes about not as a result of a law passed by Parliament, but instead as a result of the way a discretion bestowed by Parliament has been misused, in my view, by some sentencing judges.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123741">In this area, Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> clarifies how that discretion can be used by providing specific disqualifications based, it is important to note, on existing provisions within the Criminal Code.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1123742">Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> clarifies how a vested sentencing discretion is to be used and how it is not. In assessing the impact of this bill, it is wise to start with the specific section it modifies, namely subsection 719(3) of the Criminal Code, which states:</ParaText><ParaText id="1123743"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">In determining the sentence to be imposed on a person convicted of an offence, a court may take into account any time spent in custody by the person as a result of the offence.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1123744">Four things stand out in this wording. The first is that the court “may”, not must, take pretrial custody into account. I am advised that on some seemingly rare occasions judges have refused to give such credit precisely because of past criminality and breach of existing bail orders.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123745">The second is that the time considered is that spent in custody, not on bail under restrictive conditions but in custody.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123746">If there were any doubt about that, judges need only look above subsection 719(3) to subsection 719(2), which expressly says that time spent:</ParaText><ParaText id="1123747"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">--at large on interim release granted pursuant to any provision of this Act does not count as part of any term of imprisonment imposed on the person.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1123748">In other words, what the sentencing judge did in the Moffitt case was contrary to the express provisions of the Criminal Code. Members will be interested to know that this view has been accepted by the Ontario Court of Appeal.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1123749">The third item that stands out is that the section does not specify any mathematical formula such as the two for one or even three for one calculation currently in vogue.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123750">Fourth, and I think most important, is that the section specifies that the time to be considered is time spent “because of the offence”, not “because of breaching previous bail” or “because of a lengthy record” but “because of the offence”.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123751">This is consistent with the way our system handles life sentences for persons convicted of murder. Pursuant to section 746 of the Criminal Code, the clock on parole ineligibility starts running from when the person is arrested and held in custody, as used to be almost always the case on murder charges in years gone by.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="30">(1830)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1123752">In other words, if a person is denied bail not because of the offence, but because of the offence and his or her lengthy criminal record or violation of bail, then that person should not qualify for this consideration.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123753">In enacting subsection 719(3), Parliament has deliberately expressed the qualification for this benefit, and it is not up to the courts to add to it, especially when the grounds for the denial of bail are themselves expressly stated in the Criminal Code directions to courts about when to deny bail. In plain English, it is called common sense.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123754">Not only have courts abused this discretion by applying it to the wrong people, they have taken it upon themselves to artificially create “extra” credit based on their view of the nature of the remand facilities. This is where the two for one or three for one calculation comes from.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123755">The irony of the no doubt well-intentioned judicial inmate advocacy has apparently escaped judges who follow this practice. By giving extra credit for remand, they are providing an incentive for people denied bail for past criminality to stay in remand to take advantage of the extra credit. Then they have their lawyers complain about the overcrowding as justification for extra credit. If there was ever an artificial absurdity in dire need of correction by Parliament, this is it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1123756">It used to be that in the old days when the career criminals got caught and were denied bail because of their past records, they quit the delaying tactics and pled guilty to what they knew they were going to be convicted of. They did it to avoid what was known as “dead time”. Today, thanks to misguided judicial misuse of a legitimate discretion, that dead time has been converted into the gift that keeps on giving.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123757">Canadians following the debate will be shocked to learn that this abuse of discretion has literally caused their justice system to reward past misbehaviour and violation of bail by giving it extra credit when it comes to sentencing. I know this will come as a shock to those who think complexity is always better, but we need a system that rewards non-offending and compliance with court orders. We need a system that punishes continuing criminality and breach of bail.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123758"> Put simply, we need to restore to our justice system the capacity and willingness to tell the difference between right and wrong.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123759">Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> does exactly that and it will also restore public confidence in our judicial system. Canadians are rightly wary of a justice system that says one thing but does another, and where we have to read the fine print to see what the truth is. Quite frankly, Canadians deserve better than this. It is up to us to make sure they get it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1123760">I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate my colleague for <Affiliation DbId="78536" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville</Affiliation> for the hard work and dedication he has put into the creation of the bill. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123761">As with all legislation, there are some changes we need to look at. If the bill is sent to committee, the committee will study it and will even make the bill better in some cases, but I think it is important to remind all colleagues in the House that we all ran on the idea of fixing our judicial system to make it stronger and better for all Canadians and for future generations.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We heard from the member for <Affiliation DbId="78536" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville</Affiliation> about the horrendous experience that he and members of his family experienced as a result of the use of a concealed weapon.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123764">It is generally the position of the NDP, policy-wise, that we are not supportive of mandatory minimums. We strongly believe in the use within the judiciary of judicial discretion so that the crime and punishment fit the individual facts, as opposed to applying across the board mandatory minimum sentences and taking away from the judiciary the right to apply appropriate sentences based on the facts that are before them, and as opposed to being compelled to impose a penalty no matter what the facts are.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1123765">As a political party, we certainly in the past have made exceptions to the rules. We are quite supportive of the use of mandatory minimums in a variety of ways with regard to impaired driving, where in fact their use has been successful. More recently, we have been supportive of the use of mandatory minimums with regard to the use of firearms in the commission of crimes, because in both of those cases we are faced with an epidemic of crime of crisis proportions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123766">We are able to show, perhaps not as fully as we would like, that the use of mandatory minimums, a more severe form of punishment and penalties, is successful when it is targeted and when we are dealing with a crime that is at a particular crisis level. It is effective there. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123767">We are able to show, particularly by looking to the experience in the United States, where the use of mandatory minimums grew out of all proportion, that it did not have any particular impact on the reduction in crime in those states where it was used extensively. In fact, we are seeing a number of state governments in the United States now repealing mandatory minimum sentences because they have been shown not to be at all effective and in fact have been shown to be useless when they are used broadly.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1123768">To come back to Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document>, I think we all can appreciate and be concerned about the process that the member for <Affiliation DbId="78536" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville</Affiliation> went through and understand his motivation in moving this bill before the House. Unfortunately, that is not the way law should be drafted. In particular, criminal law should not be drafted from that perspective. I do not want that to sound in any way critical of him, but it is simply an observation of the methodology that one should apply when one is creating criminal law. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123769">I do want to be critical of the government and maybe the Conservative Party and its members. The government cannot continue to try to amend the Criminal Code piecemeal. This is another example of it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123770"> If the government is really serious about widespread reform as the government sees it, or as changes to the Criminal Code and maybe to the ideology behind the Criminal Code, to the philosophy of sentencing and the philosophy of punishment as the government would see it, then it has to be government policy. We cannot be doing this ad hoc and piecemeal, one section of the code at a time. It is just simply not the way to have a criminal justice system that makes any sense.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="40">(1840)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1123771"> The government is not doing that. I have stood in the House repeatedly over the last couple of years, since the Conservative government has been in place, and criticized it for not doing that. I have implored it, if it is serious about amending the Criminal Code, to do it in an omnibus way and bring in massive legislation. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123772">The code is in terrible shape in many respects. It has contradictions in it. Penalties are too severe in some cases and not severe enough in others, when the crimes are juxtaposed with the resulting range of penalties that can be imposed. It needs to be updated in a number of ways because of the advance of technology. Rather than do this in a way that would be systematic and effective, the government has not done that. It has brought in a series of bills. In addition to that, private members have brought in a series of bills.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1123773">I do not have the number, but Parliament, since January of 2006, has to have been faced with at least 50 bills on crime, between the 10 to 20 that the government has brought forward and then at least the 30 to 40 more in the form of private members' bills. It is confusing. It is an erratic way to proceed with reform of our criminal justice system. It is just not the right way to do it, but the government continues.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123774">I want to be clear. As individuals, there is always a free vote. However, members of the NDP always discuss it and we have not collectively come to a decision as to whether we will support the bill at second reading and send it to committee or vote against it second reading.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1123775">I want to express another concern about the bill. The very first major criminal law bill, an amendment to the Criminal Code, which the government introduced shortly after it was elected, was Bill <Document DbId="2172003" Type="3">C-9</Document>. That was back in the first session of the 39th Parliament. The bill went to the justice committee and was significantly altered in the committee. It dealt with conditional sentences. When it came back to the chamber and was finally passed, it expressed the will of Parliament, the significant majority of parliamentarians who were elected in the last election.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123776">We made it very clear to the government that the use of conditional sentences was not to be cut way back as Bill <Document DbId="2172003" Type="3">C-9</Document> originally proposed to do, again leaving to our judiciary the discretion as to when a conditional sentence was appropriate. That message was very clear. My estimation was that perhaps as many as 90% of the crimes that the government wanted to exclude from the purview of conditional sentences were in fact put back in by the justice committee in the amendments and then adopted by Parliament, by the expression of the will of a significant majority of parliamentarians.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1123777">This bill, and it is just a small part, would preclude the use of conditional sentences by introducing a mandatory minimum in these circumstances. It seems to me the bill is contrary to the intent of the spirit of the vote that we took under Bill <Document DbId="2172003" Type="3">C-9</Document>. I almost question whether the bill should have been allowed to proceed because we had a vote in the House. It was a government bill altered by the opposition parties quite significantly and I believe that vote would have precluded this bill from coming forward. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123778">I believe it should never should have come forward to the House, given the rules. However, it has and it is before us, but it causes me great concern as to whether we should support the bill, given the vote that has already taken place in the House.</ParaText>

It would invoke a mandatory minimum for the commission of a criminal offence with a concealed weapon. It would also amend the Corrections and Conditional Release Act to provide victims and their families more information on release applications. It also seeks to codify the remission for time served. I do not think it is in the Criminal Code now, but a lot of the judges use the two for one formula and this would go one for one.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123781">At the outset, although I respect the member for <Affiliation DbId="78536" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville</Affiliation> and I appreciate the work he has put into this and I appreciate his motivations, I cannot support the bill, mainly because of the implementation of the mandatory minimum sentence for this offence. It appeals to certain individuals, but the bottom line is it takes away or it fetters any use of judicial discretion. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123782">In any case, coming before a judge, the judge is required to apply the fundamental accepted principles of sentencing, the established ones being retribution, deterrence, possible rehabilitation of the offender, protection of the public, circumstances surrounding the offence, circumstances surrounding the offender and others. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1123783">No two cases are alike. A judge could practise for 40 years and he or she would never see two cases that are the same. I had the privilege of practising law for 25 years. I acted both as a part time prosecutor on these cases and as defence counsel. I have looked into the eyes of these individuals. There are no two cases alike.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123784">It has been done in certain cases, but the imposition of a mandatory minimum in offences such as this would, in my opinion, be a step backwards.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123785">We are dealing with a first offender, and this again goes back to the fact that no two cases alike. It is perhaps the person's first real run-in with the law. I have seen situations of younger people getting in with the crowd or they are under the influence of drugs and alcohol. The judge has to take into account deterrence, retribution, circumstances of the offender and protection of the public. However, in that case, as in a lot of the cases, rehabilitation of the offender has to be a primary consideration.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123786">The circumstances change fundamentally if we are dealing with a person with a record of three or four criminal offences. Then those other principles give way to protection of the public.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1123787">I do not suggest that sentences be lenient or that there be no sentences. What I am saying is no two cases are the same and we cannot throw out of the back of the truck the fundamental principle of judicial discretion. I am like everyone else in Canada. I see situations. Sometimes I up the paper and read that somebody convicted of an offence, which sounds terrible, and probably is, gets what I consider to be a light sentence. Now that could be one of two situations. The first is that in actual fact the sentence was quite a bit lighter than it should have been, maybe there was an appeal or maybe the judge screwed up. The second, and more likely, is that the media got the facts screwed up totally. It does not describe the offence or the offender, and we are left with an erroneous impression that this has come about.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123788">The bill does not take into consideration regional differences. We have the northern communities. We have east and west. Everyone has different crime rates, different causes of crime. This would be an amendment to the Criminal Code and would be binding on all regions in Canada.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="50">(1850)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1123789">The bill does not take into account differences in cultures. We have a situation where people who come from the western province, where you come from, Mr. Speaker, where the first nations population has a certain percentage, but the percentage in prisons is five or six times that. Why is that? Why do we have five or six times the percentage of first nations in our prisons? Is there a reason? Will imposing the mandatory minimum sentence improve that? Everyone knows it will not. What is the cause of this? It is early in the game, but I believe some things such as healing circles and restorative justice are working. Once we pass this legislation, a lot of that may be go out the back door.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123790">I have concern about the whole administration of justice. A lot of these cases are bargained. Literally the system cannot handle the cases before it, but if there is a mandatory minimum, no defence counsel will agree to anything and we will go to trial.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123791">Those are some of the considerations. In principle, it sounds great, but there is fundamentally one problem: it does not work. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1123792">The previous speaker talked about the situation in the United States. This was a movement, which started in the United States about 20 years ago, where once it invoked the mandatory minimums, the crime rate would go down and everything would be great. It did not happen. The previous speaker said that some states had repealed their mandatory minimums. I actually know the number of states. Since 2003, 25 states have repealed the legislation dealing with mandatory minimum sentences. That probably represents half of the people living in the United States. The research indicates that it generally does not work. Our southern neighbours are realizing this now and that is why they are repealing it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123793">I make these comments with the greatest respect to the member for <Affiliation DbId="78536" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville</Affiliation> and the motivations behind this draft bill, but I cannot support it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123794"> On the principle of the so-called two for one formula, as far as I am aware, that is not in the Criminal Code now. It is a practice that has developed over the years. It is generally widely accepted. I am not saying I agree or disagree with it because every case should be dealt with on its merits. We had the high profile case of Brenda Martin back from Mexico and there was speculation a judge would be hearing the case in Canada and would give her the so-called two for one credit. Again, it comes back to the judicial discretion in a particular case. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1123795">The two for one is not codified now. It is just a rule of thumb. If we had the one for one codified, that would go forward with the actual sentence the judge gave. Every circumstance is different. If people were in jail for protection of the public, that is one situation. However, if they were in jail for two years because they could raise the $20,000 bail, that is an entirely different situation. I would argue in that case probably they should get more credit than one day for one day. Do not forget in that two year period they were in jail because they could not raise the bail, they would not be eligible for parole. If it worked the way it often does, people might be eligible for parole after serving half the sentence, but the two years they were in jail would not apply.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="55">(1855)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1123796">The point is that we will never have two cases that are the same. Each case has to be dealt with on its merits and on the circumstances surrounding the case. In a situation like this where we are trying to invoke mandatory minimums, I suggest it is a step backward.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Even though we may have disagreements on how to do that, I am encouraged that perhaps if members opposite listened and paid attention they may actually agree that we need to change some of the things that we have done in the past.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123801">I think all of us will agree, however, that in considering changes, we are well served by ensuring that we know the facts of what we intend to do, the facts behind the issue and the consequences of any changes that we might wish to make.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1123802">This is second reading debate of this bill. I am encouraged that the committee, which will seek information from witnesses and experts, potentially offering some amendments is exactly the right thing to do and exactly why the bill needs to be supported. Further, it seems to me that the best legislation is usually as a result of having a clear understanding of why we seek to do what it is that we are seeking to do.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123803">Finally, I am sure members will agree that the justice system is one that inherently relies on public confidence, and that is a key word these days, and that it and the Canadians it is designed to serve are entitled to a system, not entitled as parliamentarians to their entitlements, but as Canadian citizens they are entitled to a system that avoids artificiality, speaks the truth in what it does and recognizes the difference between right and wrong in how it makes those decisions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123804">These observations may seem self-evident, but as many of us are familiar with a justice system or who have listened to the descriptions of the proceedings in the Moffitt case, the terrible case that caused my colleague to present this bill to the House, it is true that it is not always the case that these observations are in fact self-evident.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1123805">Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> deals with three areas of criminal procedures. These include the exercise of discretion in determining pretrial custody credits and enhancing victim interaction in the parole process. There cannot be anything wrong with those two. The third is in the area of establishing mandatory minimum sentences for crimes involving weapons and specifically those involving knives. Other members may wish to speak to the first two subject areas I mentioned, but I just wanted to indicate that I support those areas and what I would like to do in my time allocated is focus my remarks on the mandatory minimum sentencing.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123806">As members have heard, there is a regrettable but undeniable growth in the number and seriousness of violent crimes committed with knives in Canada. Today I looked up statistics for my own region of Waterloo. I do know the member for <Affiliation DbId="78602" Type="2">Kitchener--Waterloo</Affiliation> has suggested there is no problem with crime in that region, but if he checked the statistics he would see that other violent crimes are up 28%. Offensive weapons have gone from 427 cases in 2005 to 535 cases in the next year. That is about a 20% increase. We cannot stand back and do nothing.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123807">As it frequently is the case in dealing with criminal justice reform, there is not necessarily a single answer, but instead a response that covers the spectrum of principles that underlie our justice system.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="00">(1900)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1123808">Certainly measures that attempt to prevent people from engaging in criminally carrying knives or in stopping such behaviour is part of that solution. The bad guys have to know that if they are going to do serious crimes, they will do serious time. At this stage of the bill we can leave the balance to the experts at committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123809">The point of Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> which I completely support is that for some people the knowledge of a certain and unpleasant consequence does work as a deterrent. This is the root of mandatory minimum sentencing. It is, as members know, a long-standing part of our justice system. This kind of stuff already exists. I might point out that the Supreme Court has just upheld that it is in fact constitutionally valid.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123810">In fact, let me quote from that case where Chief Justice McLachlin, speaking for a unanimous court, rejected the idea that there could be an exemption to what Parliament enacted as a four year mandatory minimum sentence for causing death with a firearm, which is the same one as proposed in Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document>. She said:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1123811"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">In granting a constitutional exemption, a judge would be undermining Parliament’s purpose in passing the legislation: to remove judicial discretion and to send a clear and unequivocal message to potential offenders that if they commit a certain offence, or commit it in a certain way, they will receive a sentence equal to or exceeding the mandatory minimum specified by Parliament. The discretion that a constitutional exemption would confer on judges would violate the letter of the law and undermine the message that animates it.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1123812">If any of my colleagues want to look that up, that is from R. v. Ferguson , paragraph 55. I selected this quote simply to remind members of two things: one, this type of thing already exists in the Criminal Code; and two, it is constitutionally valid.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123813">The point behind mandatory minimums is not simply to cause courts to sentence more severely but, as the member opposite just said, to actually contribute to there being less need in the long term for courts to sentence because at least some people would be getting the message. It is not a total solution, but it is part of the solution. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123814">One of the mandatory minimum sentences proposed simply adds homicides committed with a knife to section 236, which already requires such sentencing, as I have stated, for homicides committed with a firearm.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1123815">Given the disturbing reality of knife homicides actually now outnumbering firearm homicides, I trust that members will come to their senses and all members will support this bill at second reading.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123816">Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> creates a new mandatory minimum sentence with escalating time for repeat offenders for persons convicted of criminally possessing a concealed weapon, which includes a knife. This does not create any new kind of criminal liability for someone in lawful possession of a knife. It does, however, do several important things. It creates a mandatory minimum custodial sentence of 90 days' incarceration with a minimum one year sentence for subsequent offences. This is a clear and unequivocal expression of Parliament that a dangerous behaviour that too frequently and increasingly frequently leads to deaths like that of Andy Moffitt is unacceptable and Canadians deserve better care.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123817">I want to conclude by saying that anyone who practises criminal law will attest that such actions as increasing maximum sentences that we have seen from the previous government are literally useless. It does not mean anything simply because the courts virtually cannot ever hand out maximums.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123818">I have to salute my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78536" Type="2">Leeds—Grenville</Affiliation>, for introducing a bill with practical, specific, targeted measures which I do believe will produce tangible results.</ParaText>

He has had a very active role in developing this legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123824">There are reasons for legislation to come forward. This is an example where a member of Parliament, through a cause in his community or a cause on behalf of people he knows, has developed legislation that would actually work for victims and the victims' families. That is an important part of our job as members of Parliament and as makers of the laws of Canada. People's experiences, and not always good experiences, give them the ability to communicate and work with members of Parliament on these types of bills and allows these types of discussions. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123825">I support the bill at second reading and support the idea of moving the bill to committee so we can have more discussion. People in other organizations have lots of concerns about some parts of the bill. That is why it should go to committee. It can be worked on there and people can bring their own experiences to committee and offer changes that may or may not be needed. I will certainly be following this very closely.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1123826">As many people have said, the bill proposes to create new mandatory minimum sentences of imprisonment for carrying a concealed weapon, as well as for manslaughter committed with a concealed knife against an unarmed victim.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123827">When people are awaiting their trial and sentencing there is sometimes a trade-off in days spent and three days may be traded for one. That is not what Canadians want. People have told me time and time again that this is not what they want, and the member has addressed this issue in his bill. Canadians want people to be accountable for their actions and to be responsible to the public. It is our job as legislators to develop laws that protect the victims and their families. Often friends in my community tell me that they have a real problem with people being kicked back into the community, barely having served any time, and not accepting full responsibility for, or understanding the implications of, their actions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123828">I am certainly supportive of the bill.

Its goals are straightforward and they deserve our support.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123832">The bill will break the escalation of violent knife crimes by applying deterrent measures, including for the act of criminally carrying a concealed weapon. It will end the abuse of judicial discretion that results in career criminals and bail violators being rewarded at sentencing and ensure crime victims are kept properly informed and not subjected to procedural abuse in their interaction with the National Parole Board.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123833">These measures are intended to deal with systematic issues that are not theoretical or ideological. Their origin comes from the current realities of crime and the justice system in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123834">When the bill was debated on April 11, I was surprised to hear some members opposite suggest that it was the response to a single case. In fairness, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78519" Type="2">Burnaby—Douglas</Affiliation> did ask if there were other examples, and while I mentioned some in general terms during my original remarks, let me now provide greater details.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123835">Members no doubt took note of the recent release of the youth crime stats which reported that youth homicide rates have risen 41% since 1997. About 44% of homicides committed by youth involved a knife, while 17% involved a firearm. Violent crime has risen 30% since 1991.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1123836">In preparation for this debate, my office did by no means a complete media scan. We started back on October 24, 2007, and ended just the other day on May 25. I have assembled clippings, and I stress that they are not complete, but we have recorded 170 stabbings or robberies with a knife and 44 separate homicides with a knife. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123837">To be more precise, since our last debate on the bill on April 11, we have noted 45 stabbings and 14 knife homicides in just six weeks. These incidents involved swarmings, home invasions, robberies and assaults, and fights tragically escalated through the use of a previously concealed knife.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123838">There are other systematic factors involved in at least some of the cases, but having the House send a deterrent message, a preventive message such as recognized recently by the Supreme Court of Canada, is a positive step to make this country a safer place.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123839">The same clipping survey details cases of violent offenders, who were denied bail because of their past criminal records, being rewarded with not only credit for the time they earned in precustody but with double and in one case even triple credit for their ongoing criminality.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123840">In one case extra credit was awarded for a vicious knife attack, even though the offender had his bail revoked when he was charged with being an accessory to murder while on bail for the stabbing.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1123841">The law does not require such credit, but I would suggest that the law needs to be changed to prohibit in these narrowly defined circumstances.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123842">My background is not in criminal law, but working on the bill has shown me that we need more than just a legal system with rules to be followed without question. We need a justice system where those rules actually support the principles of justice, like past misconduct not being rewarded when it is followed by continuing criminality or consequences for breaching court orders.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123843">Bill <Document DbId="3073229" Type="4">C-393</Document> is limited in scope and in purpose. I welcome suggestions about how it could be improved to achieve its goals. I have already received several constructive wording suggestions which I think will do exactly that.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123844">This is the rationale and mandate of our committee system. I urge members to vote to send the bill to committee so we can do the work that we do best.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123845">The bill has received public support from the Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime and from Commissioner Julian Fantino of the Ontario Provincial Police. Let me quote from his remarks, “It is a regrettable but undeniable reality that the carrying of criminally concealed knives and violent knife crime itself has increased dramatically in Canada recently, with all too often deadly consequences. I am confident that your bill will prove to be a deterrent to such actions for some offenders”. He also said, “I am very pleased to see that Bill C-393 also addresses a development of sentence calculation which has crept into our justice system”. He has offered to appear at committee.</ParaText>

Gurbax Malhi (Bramalea—Gore—Malton, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1123890">Mr. Speaker, on April 3, I asked several questions of the government about the amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act contained in Bill <Document DbId="3354384" Type="3">C-50</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123891">Instead of answering my questions, the minister started a taxpayer funded advertising campaign in ethnic media across the country to convince immigrant communities that, despite all evidence, they can trust the government with the future of Canada's immigration policy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123892">In addition, the <I>Globe and Mail</I> reported yesterday that the minister secretly used Toronto city hall meeting rooms to promote the Conservative Party's views on the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and Bill <Document DbId="3354384" Type="3">C-50</Document> to ethnic media outlets.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123893">This is despite the minister's rejection of Toronto Mayor David Miller's requests for a consultation on the proposed changes.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123894">Mayor Miller is not the only one who is not being fully consulted. The speed at which these amendments have been pushed through the House and its committees shows the government's lack of respect for the opposition and parliamentary procedure. Given the potential impact of the bill on the future of Canada, the government owes it to Canadians to remove the immigration provisions from Bill <Document DbId="3354384" Type="3">C-50</Document> and propose them as separate legislation. Changes of this scale should not be just an afterthought in a budget bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123895">The minister has also refused to tell Canadians who she would fast-track and who she would leave behind under the new regulations.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1123896">This is not a surprise. It would be nearly impossible to sell Bill <Document DbId="3354384" Type="3">C-50</Document> if the minister admitted that she plans to put a cap on family class applications, which she has refused to rule out.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123897">One idea that has the support of many in the immigrant community is my proposal of a visa bond system. Under a bond system, immigration officers could give applicants or sponsors the chance to provide a financial guarantee in borderline visitor visa cases. This would help many applicants wanting to come to Canada for weddings and funerals to avoid the rejection and emotional distress they face under the current system.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123898">Canada's visitor visa process is unfair and discriminatory, especially for applicants from developing countries.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123899">The amendments in Bill <Document DbId="3354384" Type="3">C-50</Document> would do nothing to improve the situation for visitor visa applicants and, as such, would not truly fix Canada's immigration system.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123900">The government has attached its immigration proposals to a budget bill and tried to force them through the committee and the House without making amendments and used tax dollars to sell its plan to immigrant communities. These are the actions of a government that knows its views on immigration are at odds with those of the majority of Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123901">I again ask the government why it is sneaking these reforms in through a budget bill, instead of allowing the House to have an independent debate on this critical issue.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

That is what has been done. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123903">The intention with Bill <Document DbId="3354384" Type="3">C-50</Document> is to take care of the backlog that grew under the member's government over the past number of years from 50,000 to over 800,000, and continues to grow. No one is served by the fact that we are simply taking in more and more applications. The bill would stop the backlog from growing and then would address the backlog to ensure families are reunited faster, skilled workers are brought in from every country and race, to ensure that those skills that are required in the community are met by those who have the skills, and to ensure that is done fairly quickly, not over a period of six years, but in a period of months. It is important for the bill to go forward so that can happen.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1123904">The bill would also ensure dollars are invested to reduce the backlog in a proper fashion. It will not be discriminatory in any way with respect to race, religion or ethnicity. It will be charter compliant and dealt with on an objective basis. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123905">Our party is proud of the fact that we have many members of ethnic communities in our party. We were the first party to have a Muslim elected to Parliament, the current member for <Affiliation DbId="78487" Type="2">Edmonton—Strathcona</Affiliation>; the first Japanese Canadian to become a cabinet minister, our <Affiliation DbId="111559" Type="4">Minister of International Cooperation</Affiliation>; the first Chinese Canadian MP; the first Hindu MP; the first of two Indo-Canadian women, the member in our party for <Affiliation DbId="78863" Type="2">Fleetwood—Port Kells</Affiliation>; and, the first black MP and minister of the Crown. Under the previous Clark government, there was a generous response whereby 77,000 Indo-Chinese refugees entered Canada between the years 1975-81 and, of course, Prime Minister Mulroney introduced the first Multiculturalism Act in 1988.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1123906">We have opened our arms and doors to invite people from various cultures and countries to come into our country but the immigration system has been burgeoning and has not been proceeding as efficiently as it should. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123907">Also under the previous government, in which the member was a part of, settlement funding was literally frozen for over a period of 10 years. People were coming in but they were not given the support or language training they needed to become integrated as quickly as possible. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123908">Under previous budgets, the government allocated $1.4 billion over five years to directly address settlement issues and to ensure that those who came here would succeed. We also reduced the head tax on newcomers by cutting it in half in the previous budget. In the new budget, we have allocated $109 million over five years to ensure efficiency is built into the system and that it works the way it was intended. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123909">My sense is that we will have more newcomers joining us quicker, more being reunited with their families quicker and more becoming successful citizens faster.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Gurbax Malhi</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1123910">Mr. Speaker, no one can dispute that Canada's immigration system must be fixed. What the opposition, immigration experts and Canadians do not agree with is the way in which these amendments have been proposed and the unnecessary powers that they would give to the minister.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123911">Major changes to Canada's immigration system, such as those contained in Bill <Document DbId="3354384" Type="3">C-50</Document>, must be debated openly, honestly and in a non-partisan fashion. The government has failed to meet these three requirements and has failed to earn the trust of Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123912">I urge the government to listen to Canadians, remove the amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act from Bill <Document DbId="3354384" Type="3">C-50</Document> and allow them to be debated and voted upon on their own merits.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I thank them for that because the bill does need to go forward to address, not only the continuing growth in the backlog that ballooned from 50,000 to over 800,000 under that member and his government's term in office. It needs to be addressed now.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Do not forget that the cost of basic foods has gone up 48% since the end of 2006. According to the director of the World Food Programme, a “silent tsunami” is threatening to plunge 100 million people into hunger. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123917">The government announced $50 million in additional support for the World Food Programme and then let things run their course, believing that it had done enough.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123918">It put a band-aid on a gaping wound, so to speak, and did nothing to address the root of the problem. Speculation, the use of food sources to produce biofuels, and our irresponsible energy consumption have contributed to the world food crisis, and we know it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123919">The government must commit to dedicating 0.7% of its GDP to international aid, as it is supposed to. At least it has untied its aid, but we must first and foremost help populations in crisis to produce their own food.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1123920">We all know the proverb “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.” In international aid terms, this means: build supply roads so that village crops can get to the cities in developing countries; stop promoting within international organizations the massive cultivation of export crops, which in the end only ruins farmers who adopt the practice and starves the population—in other words, to a certain point, the food sovereignty of developing countries must be respected; immediately stop subsidizing the production of biofuels that directly use food crops—here, the grains in question—to produce ethanol, which causes prices to rise and diverts precious resources to fuel our cars instead of feeding people.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123921">Given the scope of the crisis and the absence of a successful conclusion without a drastic change in energy policies and international aid policies, a number of major players are calling for significant changes.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123922">The director of the IMF, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, sounded the alarm by saying that the current food crisis could lead to war and uprisings. The IMF also estimates that 70% of the rise in the price of corn is because of the use of biofuels and the subsidies granted to biofuel producers.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1123923">French foreign affairs minister, Mr. Kouchner, proposed banning speculation on raw food materials, which he described as completely immoral. </ParaText><ParaText id="1123924">What does this government propose? To give money to ease its conscience and continue unhealthy practices? Or does this government really have a long-term, responsible vision that respects the needs of all populations around the globe?

It gives me a chance to let Canadians know about the improvements this government has made in terms of international assistance and food aid in general.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123926">This government believes in “compassion for the less fortunate”.

In fact, it is our compassion for the less fortunate that has guided our vision.

It is through partnerships with organizations like the Canadian Foodgrains Bank that we are helping to address the global food shortage.</ParaText>

He said:</ParaText><ParaText id="1123930"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">It's not just a Band-Aid.

It will make food cheaper when it is brought closer to hunger zones. Shipping costs will be reduced and local producers will be encouraged to build capacity to feed people. As we all know, tied aid is 30% less effective.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123934">This is what Canada has done. It has untied 100% of its food aid.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1123935">If we look at what this government has dedicated to food aid this year, which is approximately $230 million, that translates into an additional $35 million more that will be used to directly purchase food for the less fortunate.</ParaText><ParaText id="1123936">Once again, I want to thank the hon. member for the opportunity to discuss this issue she has talked about.

Earlier, he spoke about his vision of a balanced economy. We think that the economy we have built since the second world war is balanced, because of its primary sectors, such as the forestry and mining industries, its secondary sector, for example the manufacturing industry, and its solid financial services sector, and so on. All of that is part of a balanced economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124138">Canada is a very big country. It is the second-largest country in the world in terms of area.

I would refer him in particular to Table 5.4 in the budget and ask him to explain the vision behind the Conservative's decision.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124141">Here is the decision. The new fiscal year just began on April 1. So the beginning of last month marked the start of the 2008-09 fiscal year. Over the course of two full fiscal years, personal taxes are slated to rise from $112 billion to $125 billion, which is a 12% increase. Let me say that again: a 12% increase in personal taxes. As for corporate taxes, they will decrease from $42 billion to $36 billion, a drop of 14%. Let us take a look at the government's pie: personal taxes will increase by 12%, but corporate taxes will drop by 14%.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124142">What is the minister's vision of social justice, given that he was born in a place where there are many manufacturers and working people, in Lachine, Quebec?

Every time they buy something in this country, as of January 1 this year there is a full two percentage points off, which has had a very desirable effect with respect to inflation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124144">It has also made it easier to purchase larger ticket items in Canada, particularly automobiles.

British Columbia is going in that direction and we expect that Manitoba will also.

Under the leadership of our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>, we have taken many important steps to improve the quality of life for Canadians over the last two years.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124283">My remarks and my eventual questions to the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> will deal specifically with the tax-free savings account.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124284"> It is clear to Canadians that this government is taking a very different approach than the Liberals. Their Liberal vision for the economy simply repeats the same broken tax-and-spend and tax again mantra of the 1970s, along with a dangerous addiction to uncontrolled spending and reckless deficit spending. </ParaText><ParaText id="1124285">It is a tax-and-spend philosophy that is leading the Liberals to call not only for a huge hike in the GST but also for what many have stated could be the single largest tax increase in Canada's history. The Liberal leader's new regressive carbon tax represents a huge tax increase for all Canadians. It is a tax increase that each and every Canadian will feel at the pumps, at the grocery store and each and every time they heat their home.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124286">What is worse is that these tax hikes will have the most negative impact on low income Canadians, such as seniors living on fixed incomes.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124287">With the potential Liberal GST hike and the new carbon tax, Canadians are being threatened by a Liberal government that will reach deeper and deeper into their pockets with a regressive, punitive tax that will directly cause the price of everyday items to increase. </ParaText><ParaText id="1124288">For instance, as farmers see their costs escalate, the result will be higher food prices. Large purchases such as a new home or a new car would skyrocket to such new heights that they would fall out of reach for some. Indeed, the prices of everything we make or buy would jump.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124289">Both the manufacturing and the shipping of products are tied to gas prices, making the cost of the products that we export more expensive and thus less attractive in many markets. This would create a huge disadvantage for Canada's manufacturing sector, a disadvantage that it simply cannot afford at this time.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124290">Our Conservative government disagrees with the Liberals. We believe that Canadians should be allowed to keep more of their hard-earned dollars and to spend those dollars on what is important to them and their families.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124291"> That is why we have provided historic tax relief and cut the federal tax bill for families and individuals by $140 billion. This includes lowering personal income taxes and chopping the GST by two points. </ParaText><ParaText id="1124292">We also believe that the federal government should undertake measures to assist Canadians to save, helping to make it easier for them to invest in their retirement or make those larger purchases of life, such as a new home. </ParaText><ParaText id="1124293">In pursuit of this objective, budget 2008 unveiled the creation of the landmark tax-free savings account. </ParaText><ParaText id="1124294">It was a little over 50 years ago on March 14, 1957, that then finance minister Walter Harris, a lawyer from southern Ontario with a record of balanced budgets and who ran for the leadership of a major political party in Ontario, stood up in the House of Commons to announce a new tax plan to help Canadians save. </ParaText><ParaText id="1124295">At that time, the initiative was greeted with polite applause and passing interest as a measure mainly aimed at assisting those without workplace old age benefits to retire comfortably. From its humble beginnings, the registered retirement savings plan would go on to become an indispensable part of fiscal planning for every Canadian.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124296">And for that, along with his military service in World War II, we thank and we pay tribute to Walter Harris. In the city of Oshawa today, the Walter E. Harris Public Elementary School bears its name in his honour.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124297">Now let us fast forward to the present day and another lawyer from southern Ontario, another finance minister with a record of balanced budgets and another politician who has run for the leadership of a major political party in Ontario. </ParaText><ParaText id="1124298">On February 26, 2008, our current <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Whitby—Oshawa</Affiliation>, would stand in the same chamber Walter Harris did over half a century ago to announce the single most important personal savings vehicle since the RRSP of 1957. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="30">(2130)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1124299">Described by the C.D. Howe Institute as a “tax policy gem” and by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business as an “inspired measure”, the tax-free savings account will allow Canadians to set aside money in eligible investment vehicles and watch those savings grow tax free for a lifetime.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124300"> The tax-free savings account can be used to purchase a new car, to renovate a house, to start a small business or for retirement. In other words, this is tax-free money for what matters to individual Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124301">An important feature of the tax-free savings account is that Canadians from all income levels and all walks of life can benefit. Starting on January 1, 2009, Canadians aged 18 and older can save up to $5,000 every year in a tax-free savings account.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124302"> While contributions will not be deductible for income tax purposes, investment income, including capital gains, earned in the tax-free savings account will not be taxed, even when withdrawn. Funds can be withdrawn from the savings account at any time for any purpose, tax free.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124303">Naturally, not everyone is able to save each and every year. The new savings account is flexible, allowing for a lifetime of savings. Those who cannot contribute $5,000 in a given year will be able to carry forward their unused contribution room to future years. In addition, Canadians may want to use their savings and the full amount of withdrawals, to be put back into the tax-free savings account in the future.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124304">The Liberals across the floor must like it because this is the quietest they have been all evening. </ParaText><ParaText id="1124305">We believe that within the next 15 to 20 years over 90% of Canadians will hold all of their financial assets in tax-efficient savings vehicles, either through existing tax-deferred plans or this new savings account. This is a significant achievement as our population grows older, and it will provide a lasting legacy for the generations that follow.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124306">Couples often save and plan together, so Canadians can contribute to their spouse's or common-law partner's tax-free savings account depending on the spouse's or partner's available room.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124307">Some people ask how the tax-free savings account is different from the RRSP. The basic difference is that an RRSP is intended primarily for retirement. We might say that the tax-free savings account is like an RRSP, but for everything else in our life. </ParaText><ParaText id="1124308">The benefits of saving in a tax-free savings account are evident. Because capital gains and other investment income earned in the tax-free savings account will not be taxed, the person contributing $200 a month, for example, to a tax-free savings account for 20 years will enjoy additional savings of $11,045 compared to saving in an unregistered account.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124309">And the tax-free savings account provides benefits for seniors. It will provide seniors with a tax-free savings vehicle and meet ongoing savings needs, something seniors have only limited access to once they reach age 71 and are required to begin drawing down their registered retirement savings. Seniors are expected to receive one-half of the total benefits provided by this savings account.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124310"> One of the best features of the tax-free savings account is that there is no impact on income tested benefits. As our government did with the GST cuts, we have taken the interests of low income Canadians into account.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124311"> There will be no federal clawbacks resulting from the tax-free savings account. This means that neither income earned in a tax-free saving account nor withdrawals will affect eligibility for federal income tested benefits and credits such as the guaranteed income supplement and the Canada child tax benefit.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124312">For people with low and modest incomes, this will improve incentives to save. In fact, it is estimated that in the first five years over 75% of the benefits of this savings account will go to individuals in the two lowest income tax brackets.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124313">In closing, Canadians will benefit from this in many ways, but perhaps more importantly, it provides Canadians with the ability to start saving early for future needs. It is not a surprise that Canadians are excited. In my remaining time, I would like the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> to speak to the reaction that he has heard on this fine initiative.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="35">(2135)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Menzies" id="2493747"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="113996" Type="18">Mr. Ted Menzies (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1124314">Mr. Chair, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> has been doing a superb job of answering and we do not want to wear his voice out in one evening.

Canadians over the age of 18 will be permitted to deposit up to $5,000 each year. TFSA will provide greater savings incentives for low and modest income individuals. In the first five years, over three-quarters of the benefits will go to the lowest two tax brackets. That is one of the most important features to this. It provides an opportunity for all Canadians to save.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124316">Additionally, we have ensured TFSA income and withdrawals will not affect eligibility for federal income tested benefits and credits. To see how much we can save, I encourage all Canadians, and I will repeat this website, again, to go to www.budget.gc.ca.

It is a plan designed to help ensure Canada truly becomes an economic leader through tax, fiscal, entrepreneurial, knowledge and infrastructure advantages.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124526"> “Advantage Canada” is not the reactionary, short term and ultimately ineffective economic plan, and I use that word loosely, being advocated by the Liberal opposition. This government has rejected the flight to panic the Liberals have embraced when it comes to economic policy. </ParaText><ParaText id="1124527">Instead, with “Advantage Canada” we have brought forward a long term plan that not only addresses the challenges of today but prepares us for the opportunities of tomorrow. There is nothing like a message of hope. The Canadian Council of Chief Executives has observed that “the Advantage Canada strategy...will enable Canadians to take on the world and win”.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124528">Tonight I would like to focus on one key component of the “Advantage Canada” plan: the creation of a fiscal advantage through debt repayment. Our Conservative government has set ambitious debt repayment targets. Indeed, we are aiming to eliminate total government net debt within a generation or by 2021. </ParaText><ParaText id="1124529">Why? Unlike Liberal governments past, our Conservative government refuses to saddle our children and grandchildren with the bill for the excesses of the past and the present. We refuse to pass on a large national mortgage. We understand that debt just delays taxation to the next generation. </ParaText><ParaText id="1124530">However, we are not merely musing about debt reduction with empty words and hollow promises, the hallmarks of Liberal governments past. We are taking decisive and aggressive steps to meet our targets.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124531">Indeed, since forming government a little over two years ago, we have already reduced Canada's debt by $37 billion. We have brought Canada's national mortgage to its lowest level in 25 years and federal debt to GDP ratio to historic lows. Put another way, we have reduced Canada's national debt by almost $1,570 for each and every man, woman and child in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124532">Yet challenges remain. Despite our aggressive action, our national debt remains considerable at nearly $457 billion in 2007-08. Interest charges on all that debt will cost roughly $31 billion a year or about $85 million every single day, meaning that approximately 13.5¢ of every taxpayer dollar sent to Ottawa will go simply to pay the interest on our debt.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124533">Amazingly enough, though, some in the House have suggested that all of this is not really a concern and have even criticized our government for having the audacity to even consider our national debt a problem. For instance, the Liberal leader flippantly dismisses the national debt as “light”. </ParaText><ParaText id="1124534">Instead, he wants to plunge Canada into a massive $60 billion deficit spending spree that would wipe out our progress in taming the national debt. I want Canadians to think about the Liberal leader's thinking for a moment.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124535"> If someone we knew was personally half a million dollars in debt, decided to go out on a reckless shopping spree, max out his or her credit card or rack up a $60,000-plus bill the person could not afford, and as a consequence add to his or her existing debt, what would we say to the that person? I suspect the words “fiscally irresponsible” would jump to mind. </ParaText><ParaText id="1124536">Therefore, I ask Canadians if they really agree with the Liberal leader when he calls our $457 billion national debt “light”. I will let a recent Montreal <I>Gazette</I> editorial answer that question. It states:</ParaText><ParaText id="1124537"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">--to say that a $457-billion debt is low is like saying winter is short: there's just no sense in such a claim....</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1124538"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">--the higher the national debt, the less control our government has over its own finances, and so the less control Canadians have over our own lives.

It's what Tories are good at...often called upon to save the country's finances after long bouts of...Liberal spending.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1124543"> Furthermore, we believe that when the debt load falls, Canadian taxpayers, not government coffers in Ottawa, should benefit. That is why we legislated into law the landmark tax back guarantee. Under this guarantee, each year interest savings from federal debt reduction are returned to the Canadian taxpayers through permanent and sustainable personal income tax reductions. What a novel plan for Canadians. What a great idea. As of 2009-10, personal income tax reductions provided under the guarantee will amount to a whopping $2 billion. No wonder the Canadian Taxpayers Federation called our tax-back guarantee music to taxpayers' ears.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124544">I would like to delve into some of the longer term structural benefits of debt reduction which, while not necessarily top of mind, are crucially important to a strong Canada and a strong economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124545">First, the most direct benefit of lower debt is that less revenue is absorbed by interest charges, freeing up resources for more productive uses. As the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants has recently noted, continued debt reduction remains vital to improving the government's financial condition, enhancing prosperity and providing the flexibility needed to deliver on meaningful tax deductions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124546">Second, low public debt also helps keep interest rates low. In the early 1990s, inflation adjusted long term interest rates averaged over 6%, reflecting in part the risk posed to investors by the much higher level of indebtedness in Canada at the time.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124547">Since the government sets the benchmark for all the borrowers in the economy--provincial and municipal governments, corporations and households--high federal debt imposes a significant cost to the economy. Higher borrowing costs led to lower private sector investment and a less productive economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124548">Today, ongoing surpluses and falling federal debt help keep interest rates low. Inflation adjusted, long term interest rates are currently just over 2%. This makes it easier for Canadian corporations to raise funds to finance capital investment, and that translates into higher private sector investment and a more vibrant, productive economy, creating more jobs for more Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124549">This also benefits Canadians more directly as well. For instance, lower interest rates produce real savings for families making a big purchase, like the young couple in Oakville buying a new $200,000 house. Having already seen a $4,000 price reduction because of the GST cut, with a $160,000 25 year mortgage, they would save over $1,100 annually for each percentage point drop in interest rates.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124550">Debt also, as I alluded to earlier, represents a tax on future generations.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124551">Before criticizing our Conservative government's record of aggressive debt repayment again, I encourage the Liberal finance critic to take a break from working on the Liberal Party of Canada's secret plan for a massive new gas tax on home heating for seniors and those on fixed incomes, and to listen to his own words.

The substantial public debt we have in Canada now is the sum of those accumulated deficits over those years. We do not want to go back to those years.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124555">The official opposition in this place is saying it is going to spend an additional $60 billion. It voted for a bill this afternoon in the House of Commons that would require another $10 billion a year. There is $70 billion. How is the opposition going to pay for it? Now we are starting to hear about a carbon tax, as the Liberals call it, a tax on gasoline, a tax on electricity, a tax on home heating fuel, a tax that would have the greatest punitive burden on those with fixed incomes, poor seniors in this country, people receiving minimal pensions, and so on. </ParaText><ParaText id="1124556">We do just the opposite. We allow pension splitting which will save people thousands of dollars this year when they file their income tax returns. The official opposition would do just the opposite. They want to prey on seniors and make it more difficult for them to pay their monthly bills by driving up costs by new taxation. It is not surprising, because the Liberal way of doing government is big spending, big tax increases, running deficits, and accumulating public debt.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124557"> For all of the reasons expressed by my hon. friend, this is not in the long term best interests of the country and it is not fair.

For those families earning between $36,000 and $56,000 a year, since 1989 they have actually seen their real income fall by 3%. They have lost about a week's income. That is 20% of the Canadian population. Let us go further. For those families earning between $20,000 and $36,000 a year, what have they lost? In real terms since 1989, their real income has gone down by 4%. They lost two weeks of income. The worst collapse in income has been among the poorest Canadian families, that is, 20% of families earning less than $20,000 a year. They have lost nearly 10% of their income. That is six weeks of income they have lost. </ParaText><ParaText id="1124572">What has happened since 1989 is that for two-thirds of Canadian families their real income has gone down.

Of course, if we mix everything together, there has been an outstanding growth in income for the wealthiest of Canadians. Members of the Conservative Party are saying, “Great. The wealthy are wealthier than ever”. They now take half of the entire income pie in this country, so one would think the Minister of Finance would chart that.

The $5,500 savings plan, in fact, does absolutely nothing for women because 40.4% of women do not even pay any taxes. The average income of women in general is about $37,000 a year.

Of course there are some budget items that favour some people in certain occupations, for example, truck drivers who happen to be more commonly male than female. The gender analysis shows that, yes, it is a more male gender favourable tax provision. Then the government has to decide whether to do it or not. Then there are other tax provisions that are more favourable to women as a group than to men. Therefore, these are matters that we look at during the course of the budget preparation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124657">However, to make the assumption that there is some kind of magic fifty-fifty here is out of touch with the world.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Ms. Minna" id="2493953"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78831" Type="2">Hon.

This requires a highly skilled workforce and increased investment in research and innovation to develop new process technologies and vehicles that are more fuel efficient and environmentally sustainable.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124707">To help the automotive sector, the Conservative government has committed over $1.6 billion to measures that will help the automotive industry successfully meet these challenges. These include $1 billion in tax relief for the auto sector by 2012-13 and $250 million, a quarter of a billion dollar investment, over five years, through a new automotive innovation fund, to support large-scale research and development projects to develop innovative and more fuel efficient vehicles. It also includes $400 million as a contribution toward the access road to the new Windsor-Detroit border crossing.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124708">In includes an enhancement to Export Development Canada's existing export guarantee program that will increase coverage, benefiting particularly those businesses in the automotive sector. Specifically, EDC will increase its guarantee coverage under the export guarantee program from 75% to 90% for loans up to $500,000. This will assist small and medium sized manufacturers in fulfilling export contracts. EDC is also working to enhance its financing and insurance products in support of the automotive and manufacturing sector.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124709"> We fulfilled our promise to cut the GST, and we have reduced it by two full points, making cars more affordable. In fact, last month, car sales rose yet again, the fifth increase in six months.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124710">However, the Liberals want to undo these positive steps by not only increasing the GST, but also imposing, as the minister has clearly stated, a gouging gas tax that will make purchasing a car more expensive and devastate the auto sector in our province.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124711">The list of what the government has done for the auto sector does not end here. Let us talk a little about research and development.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124712">Maintaining Canada's competitive advantage also requires investment in research and development.

Budget 2008 enhances support for business investments with improvements to the scientific research and experimental development tax, which we at finance committee call SR&amp;ED. This new incentive and new program to support research and development investment in the automotive industry is something to be spoken about. </ParaText><ParaText id="1124716">This government realizes that investing in the future means investing in knowledge, it means investing in science, and it means investing in innovation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124717">I want to speak a bit about the capital cost allowance. It was not introduced in 2008. In fact, it was introduced in 2007, but the minister extended the program. We are providing further assistance for Canada's manufacturing and processing sector by extending the accelerated capital cost allowance treatment for investment in machinery and equipment for three years. Specifically, the 50% straight line accelerated capital cost allowance treatment will apply for one additional year and the accelerated treatment will then be provided on a declining basis over a two year period. </ParaText><ParaText id="1124718">I have to congratulate the member for <Affiliation DbId="78554" Type="2">Burlington</Affiliation> who chairs the steel caucus.

The one thing that stood out this evening for us when they spoke was the fact that the accelerated capital cost allowance is telling its employees of the future that they are wanted, they are needed, and they are accepted in every manufacturing company in this country. </ParaText><ParaText id="1124719">In addition, we are supporting small and medium sized businesses by improving the scientific research and experimental development tax incentive program and easing the tax compliance burden by reducing the record keeping requirements for automotive expense deductions and taxable benefits.

That is why in January 2008 the government announced up to $1 billion for the community development trust to support those experiencing hardship due to international economic volatility. The 2008 budget built on this initiative by providing an additional $90 million to extend to 2012 the targeted initiative for older workers to help older workers stay in the workforce.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124722">A one billion dollar investment, $350 million in the province of Ontario, was an investment made by the federal government. As much as we would like the provinces and the territories to give the federal government credit for making this investment, we realize that those dollars are transferred to them to allow them to make decisions according to what they believe to be in the best interests of the businesses in their provinces and territories. We are not asking for credit. We did not ask the provinces to go out and state that we were the ones who provided that community investment fund.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124723"> It takes a lot of guts and it takes a lot of nerve for the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> to allocate $1 billion for community reinvestment across this country with the full understanding that they and this government would not receive credit for it, not because we wanted the credit but because it was the right thing to do at the right time, in the right place, in this country.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="25">(2325)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1124724">Now, finally, Canada's economic fundamentals are solved and that is good news for all sectors and for all Canadians.

This will encourage investment, promote competitiveness, and most importantly, increase productivity.

We can only lead by example; we cannot dictate.</ParaText><ParaText id="1124726">The member for <Affiliation DbId="78387" Type="2">Markham—Unionville</Affiliation> agrees with the significant steps that this Conservative government has taken.

The Conservative government, which had a $10 billion surplus at the end of last year, saw the Government of Quebec introduce a program for the manufacturing sector.
