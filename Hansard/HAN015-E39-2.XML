I will quote this paragraph from page 725:</ParaText><ParaText id="766690"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">—in making their decision, Speakers will take into consideration the following: representation of the parties in the House; the distribution of sponsorship to date; fair play towards small parties; the date of notice; the sponsor of the motion; the subject matter; whether or not the motion is votable; and what has happened, by agreement among the parties, in the immediate past Supply periods.</QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText><ParaText id="766691">I believe, Mr. Speaker, that on the basis of all these criteria, you will conclude that today's opposition day should be allotted to the Bloc Québécois. Let me explain in greater detail why we feel this should be the case. </ParaText><ParaText id="766692">In my opinion, several of the aforementioned criteria are inextricably linked in the present situation. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766693">Let us go over the following criteria together: the representation of the parties in the House, the distribution of sponsorship to date and what has happened, by agreement among the parties, in the immediate past Supply periods.</ParaText><ParaText id="766694">As far as the representation of the parties in the House is concerned, I should point out that Bloc Québécois members currently account for 28% of opposition members, while NDP members account for 17.14%. </ParaText><ParaText id="766695">Standing Order 81(10) clearly states that any calculations with respect to opposition days have to be based on the calendar year.</ParaText><ParaText id="766696">In addition, whenever the opposition parties negotiated among themselves in recent years, the number of opposition days allotted to the various parties was always determined on a yearly basis and strictly respected the representation of the parties in the House. </ParaText><ParaText id="766697">It is important to take that criteria into account. In a ruling dated May 31, 1984, the Speaker said:</ParaText><ParaText id="766698"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The Chair's selection must be based on the representations of the Parties in the House and also on what happened, by agreement of the Parties concerned, in the immediate past Supply periods.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766699">Because the House was prorogued, there will be 20 opposition days in 2007 instead of the 22 initially planned. If we divide up these days according to the opposition parties' representation, we get 11 for the Liberals, six for the Bloc Québécois and three for the NDP.</ParaText><ParaText id="766700">To date, the Liberals have had 10 opposition days, the Bloc has had five and the NDP has had three. Consequently, in our opinion, the final two opposition days should be assigned to the Bloc Québécois and the Liberals.</ParaText><ParaText id="766701">If the next opposition day were given to the NDP, then it would be entitled to 20% of the opposition days in 2007, when it accounts for only 17.14% of the opposition members, and the Bloc Québécois would be entitled to 25% of the opposition days when it accounts for 28% of the opposition members. There would be a difference of 5% between the parties in the number of opposition days, when the difference in representation is 11%. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766702">I would like to make one final comment about mathematical conventions. As a result of the negotiations that took place at the start of the 39th Parliament, the Bloc Québécois and the Liberal Party agreed to give the NDP a fourth day, even though they were entitled to 3.51 opposition days at that time, because they accounted for 15.93% of opposition members in this House. The NDP got a fourth opposition day even though their representation was only one hundredth of 1% over the threshold to obtain that fourth day.</ParaText><ParaText id="766703">In this case, the Bloc Québécois is one tenth of 1% over the mathematical threshold, not one hundredth of 1%. In other words, our percentage is ten times what the NDP had during the last negotiations. Under the circumstances, we are of the view that the Bloc Québécois should benefit in the same way as the NDP did less than two years ago.</ParaText><ParaText id="766704">This brings us to another criterion for assigning opposition days, a criterion on which the NDP is basing its argument. Marleau and Montpetit say that the Speaker must demonstrate “fair play towards small parties”.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766705">Allow me to make an observation. I find it somewhat ironic that a party that publicly boasts about being the real opposition party is seeking some sort of protection from the Speaker because it is a small party.</ParaText><ParaText id="766706">That being said, Marleau and Montpetit talks about fairness toward small parties. In its arguments, the NDP is claiming that both the Bloc Québécois and the NDP have benefited from this protection given to smaller parties.</ParaText><ParaText id="766707">If that is the case, then the NDP is asking the Speaker to be unfair to one party, large or small, for the sake of being fair to a small party. This seems like a slippery slope and we feel the Speaker should never take that approach.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp><ParaText id="766708">Let us look at the last set of criteria. Again, they are: the date of notice, the sponsor of the motion, the subject matter and whether or not the motion is votable. Some of these criteria will not resolve the current situation. Both motions are votable; each was introduced by a member. Notice was given on the same day, although the Bloc Québécois motion was presented earlier in the day. That leaves just one major factor: the subject matter. And I will close on that.</ParaText><ParaText id="766709">I want to emphasize this point, which in my opinion is of the utmost importance. The NDP motion is not time sensitive, but the Bloc Québécois motion addresses an urgent matter. Foreign competition has put the manufacturing industry in a very unstable position for some time now. We know that. The potential repercussions of the recent rise in the Canadian dollar and rising energy costs are cause for great concern to thousands of workers and companies. These workers and the companies they work for expect their elected members to be concerned about their situation and to take swift action.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766710">The NDP motion may be of some interest to some people, but the Bloc Québécois thinks that workers affected by the crisis in the manufacturing and forestry sectors are far more worried about their livelihood than about the future of the Senate.</ParaText><ParaText id="766711">It is for all these reasons that the Bloc Québécois believes that the House should debate the motion by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78399" Type="2">Trois-Rivières</Affiliation> on this opposition day.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Davies" id="2189243"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78973" Type="2">Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="766712">Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak briefly on this point of order.</ParaText><ParaText id="766713">First of all, it is regrettable that we are put in this position where we are appealing to you to make a decision on where this supply day will go today. Unfortunately, the two parties could not come to an agreement, so we are now coming before the Speaker for a fair decision on this question and we appreciate that you are giving this consideration.</ParaText><ParaText id="766714">You will know that the NDP submitted a lengthy letter to you dated November 1 where we put forward our arguments, and I certainly appreciate the arguments put forward by my colleague, the House leader from the Bloc. I appreciate its position and understand that it wishes to have a supply day today, but we believe that there are some very serious arguments that would see the Speaker rule in favour of the NDP having its opposition day today.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766715">The Bloc has based its argument mostly on the mathematics of representation in the House. Our contention is, first of all, that all parties should share in the loss of supply days that was caused by the session being shortened by prorogation, as long as there is not an unreasonable result. We believe that the contention by the Bloc that only the Liberals and the NDP should lose an opposition day is not fair, nor is it correct.</ParaText><ParaText id="766716">Its argument rests mostly on the math involved in terms of representation, and it is claiming that the fourth allotted supply day in the cycle rests on the fact that it is 0.1 over the threshold for a supply day, while saying on the reverse that the NDP should not be allotted a supply day because we are 0.08 below the threshold. You can see, Mr. Speaker, that mathematically, there is virtually no difference on that basis.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766717">I do want to put forward that we do not believe that the issue of math or representation is the only issue that you should be deciding this upon. There is certainly a question here of fairness to small parties and in fact, as the Bloc itself has pointed out to you and we have in our letter, under M and M, page 725, it deals with the criteria that guides the Speaker in choosing a motion under Standing Order 81.1(4)(b). There is no question that it includes fair play toward smaller parties.</ParaText><ParaText id="766718">On that point, I would like to argue that we should examine what fair play to smaller parties has meant in terms of the practice of the business of this House. I would argue that, for example, in speaking rotations, it is very clear that fairness is provided to all parties. For example, on the opening rounds, it treats each party as equal and is a very good example where consideration is given to ensure that every party has an equal standing.</ParaText><ParaText id="766719">Second, we can look at the way question period works. Again, even though there is a rough proportion of questions being allocated to parties based on their numbers in the House, it is also based on the fact that there is a rotation that ensures that each party gets fair play and coverage, particularly in the opening round.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766720">I would also submit, Mr. Speaker, that your own decision about how you ensure that there is at least a single question per week that is allotted to an independent member of the House is based upon the same principle of ensuring that there is a sense of fair play in the House and ensuring that independent members can be heard.</ParaText><ParaText id="766721">Again we can look at the way the allocation of financial resources is made to each party. It is based on the standing that each has in the House, but one of the criteria is also the recognition that smaller parties need a certain base level of funding to be able to function, regardless of the numbers that the party may have in the House, so even the allocation of financial resources is based on this very important principle and criteria of fairness to smaller parties.</ParaText><ParaText id="766722">Mr. Speaker, I would ask you to rule on this matter and consider not only the mathematical question, but also the important question of fairness to smaller parties.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp><ParaText id="766723">I believe the request we have to ensure that there is a minimum of one allotted day per cycle, per party, is not unreasonable. In fact, it is very reasonable, and it is based on a proposal that each party in the House should have an expectation that its members can debate on at least one occasion per cycle an opposition day.</ParaText><ParaText id="766724">Mr. Speaker, if you rule in favour of the Bloc today the NDP will lose that opportunity on what is basically a very narrow mathematical argument that we think does not do justice to fair play in the House. We ask you to consider these arguments and to rule in favour of the NDP for the motion placed before the House today.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="The Speaker" id="2189280"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="81017" Type="15">The Speaker</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="766725">Order, please. The Chair obviously was aware this argument might take place, because correspondence had been sent outlining the arguments of the two parties that have made submissions and of others. I have had an opportunity to read that correspondence. I would like to thank the members who intervened in the matter and thank those who sent the letters. I am quite prepared to make a ruling now on the apportionment of the remaining allotted days for the supply period ending on December 10, 2007.</ParaText><ParaText id="766726">The number of supply days and how they are distributed throughout the year are set out in Standing Order 81(10)(a), which states:</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="766727"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">In any calendar year, seven sitting days shall be allotted to the Business of Supply for the period ending not later than December 10; seven additional days shall be allotted to the Business of Supply in the period ending not later than March 26; and eight additional days shall be allotted to the Business of Supply in the period ending not later than June 23; provided that the number of sitting days so allotted may be altered pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. These twenty-two days are to be designated as allotted days. In any calendar year, no more than one fifth of all the allotted days shall fall on a Wednesday and no more than one fifth thereof shall fall on a Friday. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="766728">As is the practice at the beginning of each Parliament, an agreement was reached among the opposition parties concerning the apportionment of the 22 allotted days for the calendar year. However, in 2007, prorogation intervened, so some three weeks of sittings otherwise projected by the House of Commons calendar were not held. As a result, given that the House did not begin sitting until October 16, pursuant to Standing Order 81(10)(b) the number of supply days for the supply period ending December 10 was reduced from seven to five.</ParaText><ParaText id="766729">As the House has heard this morning, this reduction in the number of allotted days has resulted in the parties in opposition to the government being unable to reach an agreement concerning how those days should be apportioned in this supply period. Specifically, there is disagreement about whose motion should be debated today. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="766730">The Speaker’s role in the apportionment of supply days is addressed directly in Standing Order 81(14)(b), which states: </ParaText><ParaText id="766731"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">When notice has been given of two or more motions by Members in opposition to the government for consideration on an allotted day, the Speaker shall have power to select which of the proposed motions shall have precedence in that sitting. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="766732">Furthermore, as has been mentioned in the arguments made today, <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, p. 725, states: </ParaText><ParaText id="766733"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Generally, in making their decision, Speakers will take into consideration the following: representation of the parties in the House; the distribution of sponsorship to date; fair play towards small parties; the date of notice; the sponsor of the motion; the subject matter; whether or not the motion is votable; and what has happened, by agreement among the parties, in the immediate past Supply periods.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="766734">In the vast majority of cases, of course, the opposition parties are able to reach an agreement as to which party will bring forward the motion to be debated in the House on a particular supply day. The number of cases in which the parties have not been able to agree is so small it is only rarely that the Speaker has been called upon to adjudicate such a dispute, fulfilling the obligation set out in the Standing Orders.</ParaText><ParaText id="766735">Past Speakers have noted that little guidance is provided concerning how the Speaker should exercise his discretion in carrying out those responsibilities. Even though factors to be taken into consideration are listed in <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, the resolution of any particular case will depend, as it usually does in most procedural difficulties that the House encounters, on the particular circumstances which confront the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="766736">By way of example, let us consider the factor of votability cited in Marleau and Montpetit. It might be argued that votability ceases to have much significance when the Speaker adjudicates a dispute, given that 2005 amendments to the Standing Orders made all opposition motions automatically votable.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="766737">However, in any dispute, one factor always plays a major role. As Speaker Francis stated in a ruling given on May 31, 1984, at p. 4223 of <I>Debates</I>:</ParaText><ParaText id="766738"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The Chair’s selection must be based on the representations of the Parties in the House…</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="766739">At the time of that ruling, there were only two parties in opposition; today there are three. However, the representation of the various opposition parties remains the primary consideration in ensuring procedural fairness to all opposition parties, large and small.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="766740">As we have already reviewed, the Standing Orders explicitly set out the number of allotted days and their distribution among the three supply periods on the basis of the calendar year. In this Parliament, as in the past, the agreement among the parties on apportionment of those days was based on the proportional representation of each opposition party and calculated using the traditional numerical rounding conventions. Translated into practical terms, this meant that of the 22 supply days, the official opposition got 12, the Bloc Québécois six, and the NDP four. However, prorogation saw the total number of supply days for this calendar year go from 22 to 20.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="766741">Any intervention by the Chair at this stage must, of course, take into account the apportionment that has already occurred during the two preceding Supply periods.</ParaText><ParaText id="766742">An examination of the <I>Journals</I> of the House for the first two Supply periods—ending in March and June respectively—shows that the Official Opposition has so far received eight allotted days, the Bloc Québécois four and the New Democratic Party three. </ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="766743">It seems only reasonable, then, that in the situation before us the Chair make its decision on the number of supply days to be allocated to each party in these new circumstances on the same basis as that used in reaching the original agreement among the parties. The number of days allotted to each party should reflect that party's representation in the House. By using the same method of calculation the parties used to arrive at their original agreement, the Chair has determined that the apportionment for the revised total of 20 days works out as follows: 11 for the official opposition, six for the Bloc Québécois, and three for the NDP. </ParaText><ParaText id="766744">While the Chair recognizes that this distribution is only approximate with respect to the relative numbers of each opposition party, it provides the closest approximation possible to their representation. Furthermore, let me stress again that this conclusion is based on the very same calculation used by the parties in reaching their original agreement.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766745">I suppose it might be argued that had it been known at the beginning of the year that there would only be 20 allotted days, the parties, among themselves, might have reached a different agreement concerning the apportionment of allotted days for the 2007 calendar year, or for one or more of the supply periods in it, but for the Speaker that remains speculation. The Chair must address the specific situation in which the House finds itself today and must, of course, take into account what has occurred so far this year.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="766746">In this current and last Supply period, the Official Opposition has so far had two allotted days, for a total of ten this year; the Bloc Québécois has had one allotted day, for a total of five in 2007.</ParaText><ParaText id="766747">It is therefore my ruling that today, November 13, 2007, the fourth day in the current period, shall be allotted to the Bloc Québécois. The fifth day, when it is designated, shall be allotted to the Official Opposition.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="766748">I remind the House that the guidance provided by the Standing Orders and our practice is of limited assistance to the Speaker in adjudicating this kind of dispute. The application of a mathematical formula may seem to be a crude method for a Speaker to use, one that does not take sufficient account of more subtle aspects of the problem. I believe that the Speaker's discretion in these matters is limited, especially given that the House itself has never seen fit to elaborate on the grounds on which the Chair might exercise such discretion. I do no more than repeat the request of my predecessors when I say that the Chair would welcome any recommendations from the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs that might clarify these issues for the future.</ParaText>

This is, without question, the worst crisis we have ever experienced. All industry stakeholders agree on this. What we need is action. Everyone agrees that the situation cannot go on like this—everyone except the Conservative government. It alone is happy with a laissez-faire approach. It is content to give tax breaks to the rich western oil and gas companies, while Quebec's manufacturing and forestry sectors are facing a crisis.</ParaText><ParaText id="766789">Here are some facts: since December 31, 2002, 135,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost in Quebec, which translates into one in five workers. Since the Conservatives came to power in 2006, 65,000 jobs have been lost. Approximately half of the 275,000 jobs lost in Canada during this period were jobs in Quebec. Every one cent increase in the value of the Canadian dollar against the American dollar threatens 19,000 manufacturing jobs.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766790"> Let us now turn to the forestry sector. Between May 2002 and April 2005, a total of 10,000 jobs in the sawmills and paper plants were lost. The forestry sector represents nearly 100,000 jobs in 240 towns and villages in Quebec that are today threatened by decline. The urgent need for action is obvious. Every 1¢ increase represents $500 million in lost revenue for the forestry industry in Canada. The Forest Industry Council estimates the loss at $150 million for Quebec. I repeat: the situation is serious. It threatens the industrial base of our economy. That is why the Bloc Québécois is using this opposition day to remind the Conservative government that urgent action is needed.</ParaText><ParaText id="766791"> We know there are problems. The Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology spent nearly a year studying various recommendations. It submitted a report in February 2007. After all those hearings, the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology made 22 recommendations. Of those 22 recommendations, the Conservative government agreed only to the accelerated capital cost allowance, which actually helps Alberta’s industries and damages Quebec’s economy. As a result, in proposing this motion, the Bloc wants measures to be taken immediately.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766792"> We have solutions. We have proposals. The first proposal for solving this crisis is to implement a program to support businesses that wish to update their production facilities. We have to implement a program of loans and loan guarantees to help businesses modernize. We know that these businesses are in bad financial shape. We know how hard they are finding it to borrow on the markets, which means they have to pay a risk premium, and so the interest they pay goes up. The government has to help these businesses. It must guarantee loans for such businesses, so they will be able to update their production facilities, to modernize, and so be able to get through the current crisis.</ParaText><ParaText id="766793"> We are also proposing a series of investments and tax measures to support research and development. The government has to improve the fiscal support provided for research and development and for innovation in business. It has to expand the types of expenditures that are eligible, for example by including the cost of obtaining patents or the cost of training people to work on innovative projects. The government has to make the research and development tax credit a refundable credit. Certainly there is no point in giving tax cuts to businesses that are not making profits. Giving businesses that invest in research and development refundable tax credits, however, is a large part of the solution. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766794"> The federal government has to support research; it must cancel the cuts it has made to the Technology Partnerships Canada and instead increase its funding and reinvigorate all of the leading edge sectors that the Conservatives have abandoned. Leading edge sectors like pharmaceuticals, environmental technologies, new materials and new production technologies have been left to their own devices. Contrary to what the government claims, tax cuts are not the solution to every problem.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="45">(1045)</Timestamp><ParaText id="766795"> Another solution would be to bring back an economic diversification program for the forestry regions similar to the one that the Conservative government cut. </ParaText><ParaText id="766796"> As a member from a resource region myself, I know very well what difficulties a region can face when its main source of economic activity disintegrates. The Bloc is going to pay particular attention, therefore, to the resource regions affected by the current crisis in the forest industry which desperately need to diversify their industrial base in order to deal with the situation. </ParaText><ParaText id="766797"> We should bring back a support program to help diversify the regional economies that have been hit hard by the downturn in the forest industry. There should be tax breaks for companies that operate in resource regions. Among other things, we should encourage companies to help skilled workers find employment in the regions. There should be a program to support the production of energy and ethanol from the forest industry's waste. </ParaText><ParaText id="766798"> The <Affiliation DbId="78745" Type="4">Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec</Affiliation> cancelled the special program we used to have specifically for the regions affected by the crisis in the forest industry. That is the government’s laissez-faire policy. There was nothing on this in the Speech from the Throne or in the finance minister’s economic statement. There is an urgent need for action. <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4"></Affiliation></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766799"> Our trade legislation also needs to be revised in order to protect our companies better against unfair competition. Canada’s anti-dumping legislation goes back to the days of the cold war and is completely out of touch with the new realities, especially the emerging economies and China. There is an urgent need to put Canadian trade law on the same footing as the trade law of the other industrialized countries, particularly the United States and the countries of the European Union. That is what the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78503" Type="2">Terrebonne—Blainville</Affiliation> has proposed in Bill <Document DbId="3073353" Type="4">C-411, An Act to amend the Special Import Measures Act (domestic prices)</Document>. We will return to that later. </ParaText><ParaText id="766800"> The Conservatives have decided not to make use of the trade legislation that makes it possible to provide temporary protection for our companies and gives them time to adjust to the new realities and modernize. We can only dream of a government with some vision that would protect the jobs in our districts. </ParaText><ParaText id="766801"> The final element is financial support for the workers affected by the crisis in manufacturing. Employment in this sector has been devastated. Some 135,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost in Quebec, or the equivalent of one worker in five since December 31, 2002. Quebec has been especially hard hit by the slump, and the arrival of the Conservative government has only made things worse. Since January 2006, about 65,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766802">Given the situation, the government must revisit its position on enhancing the employment insurance program. The Bloc has been proposing for years that real improvements be made to the employment insurance program and, in particular, that the benefit period be increased by five weeks for all regions, no matter what the rate of unemployment. Benefits must be increased from 55% to 60% with the calculation based on the 12 best weeks. The qualifying period should be eliminated and the minimum number of insurable hours needed to qualify should be reduced to 360 hours.</ParaText><ParaText id="766803">Employment insurance is a right, not a privilege. Workers and companies pay for employment insurance. Together, they establish measures to meet needs in the event of difficult times. We are now in difficult times, but the employment insurance program is nowhere in sight. Furthermore, what are we to make of the lack of a program for older workers who have been the victims of massive layoffs? My colleagues will tackle this later. This is a very important element.</ParaText><ParaText id="766804">The Bloc Québécois is well rooted in its communities. The Bloc Québécois supports Quebeckers, who are seeking solutions and a resolution to this major crisis for Quebec. Therefore, with this opposition day, we must convince the government that there is an urgent need for action. The future of our communities is at stake.</ParaText>

Let us remember that, a few years ago, the goal of the Government of Quebec was to create 100 000 jobs. It now seems that some people have no problem with the loss of thousands of them. It is really a tragedy.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766820">People judge a government through its actions. But in this case, inaction is the rule. We should remember that the employment insurance fund does not belong to the government. The government does not contribute to it. It is unthinkable that a person can work all life long, pay employment insurance premiums and then, when the plant shuts down — often as the only employer in town —, this person ends up living on really insufficient income support measures. If you are lucky, you will survive by using up your capital, in other words by selling your house and everything else you have, because the help which was supposed to be available through EI is not there when you need it. </ParaText><ParaText id="766821">The government does not feel any sympathy and has no will to end this. It does not want to help older workers by setting up a program which would allow them to end with dignity a life of hard work and which would give laid-off workers between 55 and 64 years of age the benefits they need to bridge the gap until they start receiving retirement benefits from the Régie des rentes.</ParaText><ParaText id="766822">This situation is unacceptable. Workers are being denied their right. The government will certainly be punished for its inaction.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Vincent" id="2189562"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78671" Type="2">Mr. Robert Vincent (Shefford, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="766823">Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to denounce the inability of this government to run this country. It is a useless government, a laissez-faire government. During the next 10 minutes, I will have other terms to describe this Conservative government that is running the country. What good is it to the citizens of Quebec and Canada to have a government that takes a laissez-faire approach and does not actually do anything for them?</ParaText><ParaText id="766824"> It is clear that it is easy for a government to run the country with a budgetary surplus of $20 billion. It is easy to take that money, to spread it around, here and there, to win political advantage. That is easy; anyone can do that.</ParaText><ParaText id="766825"> However, when the time comes to deal with a situation like the one our industry is going through, to propose real solutions to save that industry or to save employees from the loss of their jobs, what does the government do? Absolutely nothing. What has it done lately and in the last few years? It has caused the loss of 135,000 jobs, including 65,000 in Quebec. That is what a Conservative government does: nothing</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766826"> It reduced the GST by one percent. What does that mean? It means that they have reduced the price of all products, including those coming from China, all those exports that a third country is dumping on us, loading us down with all kinds of products that we cannot compete against. In fact, we cannot specify a price for those products, because the restrictions imposed make it impossible to determine a true price.</ParaText><ParaText id="766827"> So, they reduced the price of products from China by one percent. Then, they found that was not enough; so, what did they do? They lowered the GST by another one percent. Every time they lower the GST by one percent, they lower the price of products. This benefits not consumers but producers. And those producers, in Quebec like elsewhere, produce even more Chinese products. We need to be careful.</ParaText><ParaText id="766828"> What were the Conservatives thinking of when they decided to lower the GST? Of one thing only: consumers will be glad to have one percent more in their pockets. However, the Conservatives do not think any farther than the end of their noses. In fact the end result is just enough for everyone to buy a cup of coffee at the end of the month. I do not think that is the amount of money the Conservatives want to have in their pockets.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766829">What is the second thing that the Conservatives did? They recognized that the industry was not doing well and they agreed to set up a committee that examined the manufacturing sector for almost a year. As my colleague mentioned earlier, 22 recommendations were made. I heard some members say that the Conservatives acted on one of these 22 recommendations. However, they forgot to mention that it was only a partial implementation, not a full one. Indeed, our committee had asked for an accelerated capital cost allowance over a five year period, but the government applied it over two years. It does not listen to anything or anyone. It asks for studies, but once these studies are completed, it simply throws them away, without even looking at them. The government relies on a piecemeal approach, but it does not even bother to take a look at the various aspects.</ParaText><ParaText id="766830">Sometimes, I wonder whether the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has two brains: one that benefits Alberta and the other that takes into account the rest of Canada, including Quebec. Sometimes, I wonder if one of these brains has not gone astray, with the other one looking for it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766831">Moreover, the government is considering tax cuts for corporations. That is unbelievable. Who is this government trying to buy? Who is it trying to please? Obviously not the companies that are experiencing difficulties, because they do not pay taxes. So, who benefits from this measure? Once again, it is big oil companies and large corporations that are making money. Companies that are making profits do not need tax cuts, since they are already making money. If the government wants to help companies, it should target those that are experiencing difficulties. But the government still does not understand that. In fact, there is a lot that it does not understand. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="00">(1100)</Timestamp><ParaText id="766832"> From the time we started seeing the loss of jobs here and there each week, it seems to me that it should have understood. Recently, there has been an increase in the number of complaints from people in the territory of the former industry minister complaining about the government’s inertia. From one end of Canada to the other, we hear people wondering where these Conservative MPs are. They have plugged their ears. I cannot understand how they can do absolutely nothing.</ParaText><ParaText id="766833"> Then, when they talk about tax cuts to help consumers, what do they try to do? They try to buy votes. That is what they are trying to do—buy votes with a $20 billion surplus. That is not the way to help the economy. They are not helping the economy. This tax cut has to show up not only in consumers’ pockets, but also in the Canadian, the Quebec, economy. That is where we need to see it.</ParaText><ParaText id="766834"> Why do I say that? On the one hand, taxes are being lowered, sure. On the other, the Canadian dollar is fluctuating while the American dollar remains stable or decreases. We read in the newspapers that people who save money on their taxes will use it to go shopping in the United States.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766835"> What was this government thinking? I do not know. I do not understand, because the economy that should be encouraged should be our own. But now taxes are being cut to encourage the American economy. That does not make any sense. What is this government’s reasoning? I do not know. Where did it get this idea? I do not know that either, but it should switch advisers. No argument could convince me that this is one of the best things it has done to boost the economy. It is not boosting it; it is only making it worse. There is nothing good about it.</ParaText><ParaText id="766836"> What is this government doing? Every time it does something, it is to win votes in the next election. This is not what they should be doing. Jobs are being lost and it is time to work on keeping them. But the government is still not doing anything. I look forward to the time when they wake up and decide to do something intelligent. But I do not think that will happen. I am discouraged. We have to take up a supply day to try and get through to the MPs of a government that claims to promote good governance. Let me think about that for a second. This government is promoting good governance but only for itself and its lobby. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766837">What is more, as I said, industry is the one to profit from the tax reduction. If memory serves, the figure for the reduction for all Canadian oil companies is $40 million. Really now. Those companies have already been gifted with $250 million. Where will it end? When there are no industries left in Quebec? This is an important sector of the economy of Quebec, the one on which the livelihood of just about everyone in Quebec depends. And yet, what is being done about it? Not a thing. </ParaText><ParaText id="766838">From where I sit, this looks like an attempt to sell us out to the United States. If our money ends up in the States with cross-border shoppers, there will be no economy left over here. The government must stop thinking that this will sort itself out on its own, because it will not.</ParaText><ParaText id="766839">Another thing. Again, going by the figures given, I have heard at one point that the Conservative government had given $37 million to Canadian industry. That is $37 million out of $20 billion! Does the government think that is enough to save industry? The members of this government are totally oblivious. They see nothing. There is no future for them in politics. There is no future for industry. I do not know what is going to be done, but the government will have to get a grip, or jobs and industries will be lost in Quebec. If nothing is done to improve the industrial situation, things will keep on going in the same way. Nothing has been done to improve the industrial situation—absolutely nothing! I keep on saying this because I am convinced of it. What else could I say, Mr. Speaker?</ParaText><ParaText id="766840">We believe there are ways. We are not here just to complain. </ParaText>

This seems clear to me. It does not take a rocket scientist to figure that out. If they have not, we will know what conclusion to reach about them.</ParaText><ParaText id="766843">There have been program cuts. How many programs has the Conservative government cut back? Then they realize that the cuts were in the wrong place and the program needs to be reinstated. So they do so, under a new name. This is the kind of party that bankrupts itself and then starts up again under another name in order to look good. I for one have had enough of people who just do not think. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Our government has taken action to support workers as these industries adjust to global conditions and will continue to do so.</ParaText><ParaText id="766865">Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="113961" Type="2">Roberval—Lac-Saint-Jean</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="766866">The hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78399" Type="2">Trois-Rivières</Affiliation> is right to point out that the forest industry is facing numerous problems. That is a reality. Indeed, these problems include high fibre costs, falling U.S. demand, the rise in the value of the Canadian dollar, and increased energy and production costs.</ParaText><ParaText id="766867">I would like to remind my colleagues that in the 2006 budget the Government of Canada announced an investment of $400 million over two years to strengthen the long term competitiveness of the forestry sector, a key sector, and to promote worker adjustment among other things; hardly laissez-faire.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766868">I would also like to take this opportunity to once again remind my colleagues of the wide ranging benefits of the 2006 softwood lumber agreement to the Quebec forestry sector, an agreement which was supported and continues to be supported by the provinces and by industry. </ParaText><ParaText id="766869">Thanks to the efforts of our government an agreement was concluded with the United States, an agreement that received the support of Quebec and of the other major softwood producing provinces in Canada. In addition, this agreement also enjoyed the support of a clear majority of the industry players.</ParaText><ParaText id="766870">During the negotiations with the United States we worked very hard and we worked cooperatively with the province of Quebec, as well as the other provinces and the forest industry to take their interests into account. It is in the spirit of this agreement that the agreement stands as a clear reflection of those collaborative efforts. </ParaText><ParaText id="766871">Second, it is important to note that the agreement returned duties collected by the United States and ended all litigation. On that point, it should be noted that Quebec has received over $1 billion of the $5 billion returned to the Canadian industry. </ParaText><ParaText id="766872">The return of these funds marks a significant infusion of capital into the industry and was a benefit to workers and communities across Canada. It has helped industry weather these difficult times marked in particular by a sagging U.S. housing market.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766873">In addition to the fact that the agreement allows Quebec to safeguard the management of its forests, it provides at least seven years of stability to the softwood lumber industry. In addition, as provided for in the agreement, border measures will not apply to softwood lumber exports from 32 countries which include all of the Quebec border mills.</ParaText><ParaText id="766874">The agreement also prohibits the United States from taking trade remedy action for the life of the agreement, thereby protecting our exporters from the unpredictable and crippling U.S. trade action which in the past saw duties rise to as high as 27%.</ParaText><ParaText id="766875">The government is not operating alone on this issue. The government has continued to consult very closely with industry and provincial officials. Federal officials continue to hold one on one and industry group meetings with forestry companies to understand their needs and their concerns. In addition, federal and provincial government officials meet regularly to discuss matters related to the implementation of the agreement and to the state of the industry. </ParaText><ParaText id="766876">The result of this close stakeholder collaboration on the softwood lumber agreement was and is the single best way forward for this industry and the hundreds of thousands of Canadians in communities that rely on it every day.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766877">I can also reassure my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78399" Type="2">Trois-Rivières</Affiliation> that the Government of Canada has continued to work rigorously on this file, well beyond last year's coming into force of the agreement. The softwood lumber agreement establishes a formal institutional framework for the governments of Canada and the United States to manage the softwood lumber file and to address issues that arise over the life of the agreement. </ParaText><ParaText id="766878">The agreement provides for the establishment of a softwood lumber committee to supervise the implementation of the agreement, oversee its further elaboration, supervise the working groups established under the agreement and consider other matters that might affect its operation.</ParaText><ParaText id="766879">In exercising its functions, the committee is encouraged to establish and delegate responsibilities to working groups or expert groups, and to seek expert advice as is necessary. Indeed, at its 2007 inaugural meetings, the softwood lumber committee established five working groups to address both technical subjects, such as data and reconciliation, permits and customs issues and scope issues, and also longer term policy issues identified in the softwood lumber agreement such as regional policy exits and lumber made from logs harvested from private lands and log export restraints.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp><ParaText id="766880">The committee has now met twice, most recently a couple of weeks ago in Ottawa, helping to ensure that implementation and administration of the agreement proceeds effectively, efficiently and smoothly, thereby providing benefits to industry. </ParaText><ParaText id="766881">Moreover, as the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78399" Type="2">Trois-Rivières</Affiliation> is undoubtedly aware, the softwood lumber agreement also established mechanisms to assist the lumber industry reap the benefits of the highly integrated nature of the North American economy. An example of such mechanisms is the Binational Softwood Lumber Council, which is comprised of 12 industry representatives from both sides of the border and whose primary focus is increasing cooperation between the United States and the Canadian softwood lumber industry. </ParaText><ParaText id="766882">One of the key objectives of the Binational Softwood Lumber Council is to strengthen and expand the market for softwood lumber products in an effort to make North America's lumber industry more competitive over the longer term.</ParaText><ParaText id="766883"> An equally important objective of the council is to build stronger cross-border partnerships and to create a climate of trust at all levels of the industry. We are not so much competing against one another as we are building things together in these two countries. These are essential elements for any industry striving to operate successfully in today's highly integrated global economy.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766884">We understand that the forestry sector is undergoing difficult times. The reality is that North America has a highly interdependent lumber market. Its current weak condition has been caused by a decline in the U.S. housing market, around 30% year over year, which has reduced demand for wood products.</ParaText><ParaText id="766885">As I mentioned at the start, we are also, as we know, facing a rising Canadian dollar and stiffer competition from emerging markets that have lower fibre production costs. These factors have resulted in a far worse impact on the lumber industry and would have resulted in a far worse impact on the lumber industry in the absence of a softwood lumber agreement. The return of $5 billion has helped companies weather the current difficulties. </ParaText><ParaText id="766886">The government continues to listen to the concerns of our forestry communities. We are working together to develop solutions to the problems that they are facing.</ParaText><ParaText id="766887">As we have always maintained, both Canada and the United States have an interest in ensuring that the agreement operates smoothly and will continue to work closely with forestry stakeholders to achieve this goal. We should never forget that we are one another's most important commercial partners. The $1.7 billion worth of trade that flows across our border each and every day attests to that fact. In fact, that nearly all of this trade is able to move with very few disputes is an accomplishment in itself. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766888">Through the assistance of the Trade Commissioner Service and our embassies abroad, the government is working with the Canadian forestry industry to find new trade opportunities in foreign markets. Every day our trade commissioners overseas find new buyers and communicate new trade deals to the Canadian forestry and wood products industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="766889">In addition, the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade has provided funding support to the sector in its efforts to undertake various international business development initiatives through the program for export market development for trade associations.</ParaText><ParaText id="766890">As I just highlighted, mechanisms established by the agreement to assist the lumber industry exist through the work of the Binational Softwood Lumber Council. It is important that industry stakeholders on both sides of the border work together to look at new and innovative ways to confront the challenges that the industry is currently facing. The agreement and the work of the Binational Softwood Lumber Council is facilitating this dialogue, which can help create an environment within which the softwood lumber industry can prosper; an industry that is important for so many workers, communities and families across this great country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766891">The softwood lumber agreement is a good reminder of how Canada and the U.S. can work through our own domestic challenges, turn our focus to creating a more competitive North American lumber industry, and work together to find new outlets for North American lumber in world markets. The SLA has been, and continues to be, a positive factor for the Quebec forest industry and the communities that derive their livelihoods from it.</ParaText><ParaText id="766892">While recognizing the current challenges faced by the forestry sector, there is no doubt that this agreement has benefited the provinces and their forestry stakeholders by providing lumber producers with a return of duties, putting an end to longstanding litigation, and providing predictability and stability that has eluded the sector for far too long.</ParaText><ParaText id="766893">I will conclude by saying that this government will continue to keep an open dialogue with the forest industry and with provinces to ensure a prosperous and long-lasting agreement that is to the benefit of Quebeckers and all Canadians involved in the forestry sector.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

This is an indication of the ability of Quebeckers, the ability of Quebec enterprise, of small, medium and large business, to adapt and to transfer the capabilities and the skills held in those businesses in new and creative ways to create job opportunities.

It also accounts for 3% of gross domestic product. Canada is the largest exporter of forest products in the world, and the most efficient. This sector is also one of the largest employers in Canada. It provides close to 900,000 direct and indirect jobs in 300 small localities and rural communities from Newfoundland and Labrador to Vancouver Island. These are well-paid jobs, characterized by high technology and strong productivity.</ParaText><ParaText id="766919"> However, members on both sides of the House know that this sector is facing some serious problems. The world forest products market is fluctuating along with demand. The sector is prey to considerable pressures due to the rising value of the Canadian dollar, high energy costs, the mountain pine beetle infestation in western Canada, and competition from low-wage producers in Asia and South America.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766920"> The sector and the government have to work together to ensure that Canadian producers remain competitive. For its part, the sector has embraced new technologies, sped up productivity growth, adopted environmentally friendly practices at the international level, opened new markets and created new products. It knows that to remain a leader it must be at least as effective as all of its competitors worldwide in adopting new ideas and technologies.</ParaText><ParaText id="766921"> In promoting competition, innovation and success, the government is now creating a healthy commercial environment for all industries, including that of forest products. </ParaText><ParaText id="766922"> We are doing this within the framework of Advantage Canada, our strategic economic plan directly based on the challenges facing all industrial sectors. In continuing to reduce taxes and red tape, in building modern infrastructure and in encouraging a more qualified and educated work force, we are laying the foundations for economic growth, more market opportunities and more choices, for individuals as well as businesses.</ParaText><ParaText id="766923">Complementing Advantage Canada, our government has recently launched consultations on ways of making the tax incentive program for scientific research and experimental development more effective for Canadian companies, and of allowing it to play an even more important role in promoting a more competitive and prosperous economy. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766924">We are streamlining the review of major natural resource development projects and reducing red tape and regulatory burden for businesses. We are investing in human resources, skills and training so that manufacturers can have access to the most educated, skilled and flexible manpower in the world. We are investing in our infrastructure so that manufacturers can take advantage of economic opportunities in Canada and abroad. </ParaText><ParaText id="766925">Budget 2006 gave an economic boost to manufacturers and to all Canadians. Budget 2007 continues on this path. We eliminated the federal capital tax, we reduced the small business tax rate and we enhanced the capital cost allowance, with a two-year deductible for tools and equipment, in order to stimulate cash flow and investment. We did not stop there. This government just provided its support to Canadian manufacturers and processors with a tax relief of $2.6 billion in the economic statement. </ParaText><ParaText id="766926">Through our new tax reduction initiative, Canada will have the lowest general tax rate on new business investments by 2011 and the lowest statutory tax rate by 2012 among G-7 countries. This will increase productivity, stimulate employment and improve prosperity. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766927">The government is clearly working on creating a favourable environment for all industries. We are doing the same thing for the forest product industry. We have taken measures that are aimed specifically at supporting that industry. </ParaText><ParaText id="766928">During the fall of 2006, Canada and the United States eliminated one of the biggest obstacles this industry had ever faced, namely the softwood lumber dispute. Less than nine months after coming to power, the government kept its promise and resolved this longstanding dispute. </ParaText><ParaText id="766929">The softwood lumber agreement finally put an end to years of costly litigation and brought economic certainty to businesses, communities and workers in Canada. It allowed our softwood lumber producers to recover over $5 billion Canadian in deposits, which represents a considerable injection of capital for the industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="766930">The resolution of the softwood lumber dispute clearly shows our government's commitment to this industry.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp><ParaText id="766931">Canadians asked our government to negotiate a settlement that would provide stability to the industry and that would protect the livelihoods of workers, communities and families in Quebec and Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="766932">In addition to the resolution of this dispute that went on for several decades, the government announced, in the 2006 budget, a $400 million investment to support the long term competitiveness of the forestry sector, to address the pine beetle infestation in western Canada and to facilitate worker adjustment. </ParaText><ParaText id="766933">We are also honouring the following commitments. Last fall, that is in October 2006, the government announced a new shared-cost program with the provinces and territories: the targeted initiative for older workers. This two-year program is aimed at helping up to 10,000 older workers who have lost their jobs in communities where the local economy is plagued by chronic unemployment or where industries, such as forestry, are affected by downsizing and closures. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766934">This year, our government announced measures aimed at reducing the pine beetle infestation and its impact on forests and communities in British Columbia. Developed in collaboration with the Government of British Columbia, the global strategy against this infestation includes measures to prevent it from spreading east and to help affected communities in developing new forest products, markets, sectors and services, in order to insure their long-term economic well-being.</ParaText><ParaText id="766935">We have also announced $127.5 million in funding to help the forestry sector increase its productivity in the long term. The initiatives—promoting forest innovation and investment, expanding market opportunities, establishing a new national pest strategy and creating a Human Resource Forest Sector Council—will help build the environment we need for our forestry sector to compete internationally.</ParaText><ParaText id="766936">Our government has supported and will continue to support the forestry sector in Canada. The Speech from the Throne highlighted the continuous commitment of our government toward supporting the main traditional industries in Canada, including the forest industry as well as manufacturing, fishing and tourism.</ParaText>

The manufacturing and forestry sectors are facing immense challenges today. The rapid ascension of the Canadian dollar or perhaps the depreciation of the U.S. dollar and the rapidity of its decline have contributed to that, but there are also long term competitiveness issues and productivity issues that are extremely important for the entire industrial sector.</ParaText><ParaText id="766960">I will focus part of my comments on the unique challenges of the maritime lumber industry in my region of the country. Clearly, there are challenges in my region where we have a market flooded with cheap lumber that is coming from British Columbia, which is partly the result of the clear-cutting that is occurring in British Columbia as a result of the mountain pine beetle. What was originally a natural disaster has become an economic disaster for other parts of the country. We have the decline of the U.S. housing market and its impact on Canadian lumber exports, and of course, there is the rising dollar and energy prices. Our production costs are higher and the competitiveness of our product is declining.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766961">Some producers in my riding have said that the price they can get for their finished product in some cases is actually cheaper than what it costs for them to buy logs for their raw material. In fact, the U.S. lumber producers in Maine are now exporting lumber into Atlantic Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="766962">Of 92 mills operating in the three maritime provinces of Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, 22 have produced no lumber since January 2007, and 18 more have announced permanent, indefinite or temporary shutdowns. Only 16 mills are operating near capacity and they are mostly smaller producers for local markets. The rest are cutting production. To date, 1,249 employees have been laid off in the maritime lumber industry. This information is updated on an ongoing basis and in fact, there have been more shutdowns since last month. If this trend continues, by December 31, 2008 the industry will be operating at 50% of 2006 production. </ParaText><ParaText id="766963">It is cold comfort to the industry to have the government say that somehow the U.S. softwood lumber agreement that the government signed in its early days is a panacea to all the challenges faced by the Canadian lumber industry. The lumber agreement with the U.S. administration at that time was more about getting photo ops for the Conservative government than it was about getting real long term results for Canadian lumber interests.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766964">It is really important to recognize the importance of supporting communities affected by the decline in the lumber industry. The first thing that ought to be done is the re-establishment of the economic diversification program for forestry regions. The Liberal government's forestry strategy in 2005 committed $1.5 billion to support the industry, including money for companies to invest in research and development, and a five year national forest community adjustment fund designed to help diversify economies for forestry dependent communities in decline.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="45">(1145)</Timestamp><ParaText id="766965">Those programs were cut and slashed by the Conservative laissez-faire government that cared more about rigid ideology than in helping Canadian communities. It is the same government that has cut labour market agreements with many Canadian provinces. Those labour market agreements were there to help workers, whether in the forestry sector or in the manufacturing sector, who found themselves in industries in decline and in transition. They were benefiting from those labour market agreements but the government cut them at a critical time.</ParaText><ParaText id="766966">The challenges faced by the lumber industry in the maritimes are different from other parts of the country because the industry has a different ownership makeup in terms of forest lands and woodlands. It is really important that members of Parliament realize that while some of the conditions in the maritimes are different, the challenges being faced by the maritime lumber industry are severe. The Conservative government is ignoring the maritime lumber industry and has failed to defend its interests just as severely as it has failed to defend the interests of the forestry industry in Quebec and across the country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766967">On the manufacturing sector side, it is clear that the government's accelerated capital cost allowance, which applies over a two year period, needs to be applied over a five year period. The Canadian Manufacturers &amp; Exporters Association has called for that. It has said that companies do not make long term production enhancement equipment purchase decisions overnight. For an accelerated capital cost allowance to actually make a difference it needs to be over a five year period not over a two year period. We have called on the government repeatedly to implement the accelerated capital cost allowance over a five year period which would help provide a stronger partnership with Canadian manufacturers to help them invest in the productivity enhancement they need.</ParaText><ParaText id="766968">Furthermore, in terms of research and development and commercialization activities that can help Canadian manufacturers compete and succeed globally in a hyper-competitive environment, the government ought to reform its SR and ED program. This program has helped Canadian companies and manufacturers involved in industries as diverse as biotech to clean tech and manufacturers that are themselves making these kinds of investments. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766969">One change that could be made to broaden and strengthen the impact of the SR and ED program would be to increase the annual R and D expenditure limit, which was established initially in 1985 pre-NAFTA, from its current level of $2 million to $10 million and adjust the taxable capital threshold from $10 million to $50 million. That would make a huge difference for a lot of Canadian manufacturing companies and other firms involved in research and development and commercialization.</ParaText><ParaText id="766970">Another change would be the removal of the current CCPC restriction on the SR and ED program for refundable credits while maintaining eligibility requirements. This would make a difference in terms of taxable income and taxable capital thresholds.</ParaText><ParaText id="766971">Infrastructure investment, particularly transportation infrastructure, is critically important. The Liberal government that I was part of had made a significant investment in the Pacific Gateway. The Conservative government has continued with that investment but has actually reduced the level of the investment that our government had initially made. The Pacific Gateway is part of it. </ParaText><ParaText id="766972">With respect to the Atlantic Gateway, the government recently announced some sort of exchange of letters or memorandums of understanding, but that is not good enough. The government should be moving more quickly to establish and strengthen trade routes along both the eastern seaboard and Atlantic Canada.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="766973">The government needs to earmark more resources for Ontario's aging infrastructure, particularly the Windsor-Detroit crossing, and it needs to make this crossing a higher priority. I read an article in today's <I>Toronto Star</I> entitled, “Chrysler CEO pleads case for new Windsor crossing”. All stakeholders need to be engaged in this.

We have had lay offs recently. A couple of weeks ago, 1,100 jobs were lost at Chrysler. I think it was last week that 800 jobs were lost in forestry. Those are just the tip of the iceberg.</ParaText><ParaText id="766989">If the currency is maintained at, near or above parity in a sustained fashion there will be many hundreds of thousands of lay offs coming down the road.</ParaText><ParaText id="766990">The government is constrained and blinkered by its ideology on this matter.

However, in Ontario, in Quebec and across the country, jobs in the hundreds of thousands are threatened by the high dollar.

The Conservatives have damaged the forest industry by destroying this program.</ParaText><ParaText id="766994">The Conservatives have damaged the auto industry with the silly, ridiculous feebate program, which hurts our industry and jobs. They have damaged it through the Korea free trade deal, which in its present form does nothing on non-tariff barriers and further hurts the domestic industry. They have not invested a penny in Canada's auto sector whereas the former Liberal government invested some $300 million.</ParaText><ParaText id="766995">The Conservatives further wounded the forestry sector.

They further wounded the tourist industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="766996"> The tourist industry is in terrible shape because Americans no longer come here because of the high dollar.

They took away the visitor GST rebate just at the moment when the industry needed it. </ParaText><ParaText id="766997">As a consequence of the total destruction of Canada-China relations, China has not granted approved destination status to Canada. China has granted that to 80 other countries, so it is hardly a selective measure.

I believe there were 22 recommendations in the industry committee report, which were unanimous from all parties. It is an excellent report and Conservatives have implemented only a small part of one of the recommendations and not the remaining 21.</ParaText><ParaText id="767000">Let me say a few words about the Liberal program for the forestry industry, which the Bloc indirectly praised in its motion.

What we have today is a full-fledged crisis in the manufacturing sector in this country. Over the past 10 years, we have seen Canada go from a $12 billion trade surplus in manufacturing to a $16 billion trade deficit. We have seen the loss of hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs. Hundreds more are lost each day. </ParaText><ParaText id="767035">Our manufacturing in Canada as a share of our overall economy has fallen by about 25% in the last 10 years, yet a large sector of our economy has depended on manufacturing, with its one in eight jobs, work for more than 2.4 million Canadians overall. This is a key sector of the economy. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767036">Let us look at our country's history. Canadians were seen as hewers of wood and drawers of water. It was through enormous effort and collective will as a country that we decided we could do more, that yes, we were blessed with abundant natural resources, which were a key part of our economy, but that it was in the interests of all Canadians for us to add value to those natural resources, to add value so that not only would we take fish from the sea, but we would process those fish. We would not simply extract minerals out of the earth; we would process those minerals. Not only would we have an abundant agricultural sector, but we would process food for our own domestic use and export abroad.</ParaText><ParaText id="767037">Most importantly, we would add value in the manufacturing sector and we would become key suppliers to the world of certain key products. As we have seen, in many sectors of the economy Canada has excelled. It did not happen by accident. It was a project of our parents and grandparents to create a vibrant manufacturing sector in this country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767038">What we are seeing of late, through a variety of factors, and I will talk about that in a minute, is the erosion of this manufacturing sector. I ask my colleagues in the House how we are going to have a healthy economy and the tax base to support our social programs, our infrastructure and all that we value in this country if we lose our valuable, vibrant and lucrative manufacturing sector. It is a huge concern.</ParaText><ParaText id="767039">I want to add some more statistics in terms of job loss in this sector. Let us look at certain areas. In clothing and textiles, we have lost 40% of those sectors. We have lost 16% of the aerospace sector, 32% of our shipbuilding sector, 13% of the Canadian food and beverage sector, 13% of the country's primary metals, 9% of paper, 8% of wood products and 7% of our automotive sector. These indicate a huge loss of jobs and huge numbers of families today are living in great insecurity. </ParaText><ParaText id="767040">These losses are spread across the country. Nova Scotia is down in manufacturing by 20%. In the Kootenay region in B.C., it is down by 25%. British Columbia lost 13,700 jobs. We see that right across the country there is a huge loss in our manufacturing sector. I know that my own city of Toronto has lost more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs. This has caused a huge impact on many families in that area.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767041">Let us look at the causes. This motion identifies the high dollar. Clearly, the high dollar is an urgent and devastating cause of job loss and stress on any sector of our economy that exports or relies on foreign investment, such as the tourism sector and our cultural sector. Our high dollar is having a huge impact. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp><ParaText id="767042">As the member does in the motion, I also want to identify free trade and poorly negotiated trade deals as one of the problems. The previous government initiated a number of free trade deals. It initiated the current deal with Korea, which the government is continuing, whereby we already have a massive trade deficit. Our auto trade deficit, for example, now totals $1.7 billion, and today we are losing thousands of jobs in Canada because of this trade deficit with Korea, yet the previous government believed and the current government believes that we should just continue to export jobs to other countries like Korea without requiring balanced trade here in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="767043">We have also seen the previous government and the current government give carte blanche to companies in corporate tax cuts, with no strings attached and no requirement for these tax dollars to be invested back into the community in job creation and R and D. It is just a gift to companies, some of which, such as the banks and the oil and gas sector, are phenomenally profitable as they stand now and certainly do not need the gift of tax breaks that will fuel further upward pressure on the dollar. It is a fiscal policy that has also threatened our manufacturing sector.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767044">The current government has continued this tax cutting agenda and seems to ignore the manufacturing crisis in the country. It is also ignoring what this means for workers who are losing their jobs and what that means to families. </ParaText><ParaText id="767045">When I raise this issue in the House in question period, the answer I get is that there are jobs being created across Canada, but if we look at what happens to people who lose jobs in the manufacturing sector, jobs that pay decent wages and have benefits which will help them support themselves and their families, we will see that often the jobs they end up with in exchange are jobs with low pay, insecure jobs and service sector jobs. They are not the kinds of jobs that allow them to live above the poverty line. That is a reason why I also have introduced a bill calling for a national minimum wage to be set at $10 a hour.</ParaText><ParaText id="767046">Another factor for people losing their jobs today in the manufacturing sector is the erosion of our employment insurance program. The previous government took billions of dollars paid in premiums by working people and employers, premiums that ought to have been given back to working people in benefits when they became unemployed. It failed to do that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767047">Today in my city of Toronto, only about 20% of unemployed workers get employment insurance. This means that 80% of working people are paying into a program but are not able to get the benefits when they need them.</ParaText><ParaText id="767048">We have an urgent manufacturing crisis in the country. It is critical not just for those who work in the manufacturing sector but for all of us right across the country. This is a high tech, high value added sector that is important to the overall strength of our economy. No other country in the world just throws open the doors and says, “Let the market decide”. All countries defend their manufacturing sector. They want to see further investment. They want to strengthen their manufacturing sector for the good of their populations.</ParaText><ParaText id="767049">Therefore, I support the motion.

There is a problem, though. The unemployment rate may be at its lowest, but it does not tell us how many people are having to work three jobs to earn enough money to support their families. They have to work in one restaurant during the day, in another restaurant in the evening and in yet another on the weekend.

It should do a study to find out where the jobs went. I am sure that they did not all go to Alberta, to Fort McMurray, or “Fort MakeMoney”, as it is called.

When the Conservatives came to power, they decided that $4 billion would do the job, even though the Americans owed us $5 billion. So we lost $1 billion to the Americans. That is just fine, because we have piles of money in Canada and we are drowning in surpluses. Rather than invest that money in infrastructure in our towns and villages, the Conservative government hands it over to the Americans, to the tune of $1 billion, no problem. And then they think they have solved the problem. But they have not solved it, because the companies were affected after that. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767069"> For example, in my riding, in October 2005 when the Smurfit-Stone company closed down in Bathurst, as it did in New Richmond, jobs were lost and that really hurt the communities. These were jobs in a paper mill that had been in Bathurst for at least 100 years. It was formerly operated by Consolidated-Bathurst. It had been there for many years. </ParaText><ParaText id="767070"> One of the problems that arose was because Canada and governments had not been vigilant in the past when it came to the freedom to sell our companies to foreign businesses. For example, one company was sold to an American business, Stone, which was then bought by Smurfit, which ultimately became Smurfit-Stone. All of a sudden, one fine day in New York, in their administrative offices, the directors of that company said to themselves that they had enough production, and looked at the map and decided to close the paper mills in Bathurst and New Richmond, period. It is over, we are cleaning house.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767071"> They send the timber harvested in the forests to another company that is foreign-owned. Take, for example, UPM which bought the Miramichi company. The timber harvest goes to Miramichi. That was when the UPM plant decided to closes its door for 9 to 12 months. Six hundred employees were laid off for 9 to 12 months. Now, we learn that the timber has been loaded on boats at Belledune and sent to Finland because Russia is refusing to provide wood to Finland. And we are the ones who are paying the price. We can see why Canadian companies have closed: foreign companies look after their own country first.</ParaText><ParaText id="767072"> I personally wrote a letter to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister </Affiliation>of Canada and to the <Affiliation DbId="78751" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources </Affiliation>asking them what our Liberal colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78918" Type="2">Cape Breton—Canso</Affiliation> had asked earlier: should there not be a summit meeting to discuss the situation? I also wrote to the premier of New Brunswick, Shawn Graham, a Liberal, to ask the same thing: Why do you not bring all the players together around the same table; industry, unions, governments and people in the region? I suggested to them that they should bring these people together around a table so they could discuss this major problem.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp><ParaText id="767073"> I was not very proud of the reply from the premier of New Brunswick. He replied that we are lucky to have those companies because otherwise it would be worse. Close the plant, take the wood and ship it to Finland. Could it be worse than that? It is shameful and scandalous that we have lost our jobs. </ParaText><ParaText id="767074"> Moreover, we are losing our resources that are being sent to foreign countries. It is not enough that they come in and close our companies; in addition, they say that if we want to buy their companies, we must not compete with them. How can a paper company not compete with another paper company? They come and tell us that it is closed and to forget them. That is what they told us. </ParaText><ParaText id="767075"> Finland is not the only place that wood from New Brunswick is being sent. It is also going to Chicago. During my tour, I went to Hearst and Kapuskasing, in Ontario, where the same problem exists. They are closing the sawmills; the wood goes to the United States and they lose their wood. I am certain that the same thing happens in Quebec and that the wood is going elsewhere.</ParaText><ParaText id="767076"> The government is not proactive. It is doing absolutely nothing to stop this. The only thing they tell us is that it could be worse.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767077"> Last week, this is what we learned about a textile company in New Brunswick. The company is Fils Fins Atlantique of Pokemouche in the riding of <Affiliation DbId="78825" Type="2">Acadie—Bathurst</Affiliation> and Atholville in the Restigouche area. It employs about 300 people. This company does business with South America, which imposes a 15% tax. With the dollar now so high, and with the 15% tax, it cannot make ends meet. The industry and the unions are asking for an agreement to remove that 15% and to have a bilateral agreement—that was already negotiated some time ago but has never been signed—to help the company to find new jobs. How many textile companies have also closed in Quebec? They are closing everywhere.</ParaText><ParaText id="767078"> The Conservative government has the nerve to boast to us that Canada's economy is strong. I can state that the economy is not doing that well in rural areas and in regions, like ours, where there is practically no more fishery. That is also the case in the Acadian peninsula and in southeastern New Brunswick and in Nova Scotia. The forestry sector is closing down because of foreign companies that buy our companies, then close their doors and distribute or ship our wood to their own countries.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767079">The federal government is doing absolutely nothing. The Liberal government with its 13 years in power has nothing to brag about either. This story about not being in power because the NDP made the government fall is old hat now. They are not in power because Canadians threw them out. They were involved in scandals, they stole money from the public and that is why they got rid of them. It was the public who did that, not the NDP. The people were given the opportunity to vote and they booted them out. They had 13 years to settle our problems in our regions.</ParaText><ParaText id="767080">The Conservatives have nothing to brag about. On their watch, there have been closures of sawmills, paper mills, textile mills all over in the rural regions, once after the other. Furthermore, it is not true that all our people want to go to Alberta, even if a number of them do so to get work. People move to the west, to Saskatchewan, to the Northwest Territories, although they want to be back home. They have families and they would like to be able to work at home. What is more, they deserve to be able to do so. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767081">I am asking the government to get all the players into the game, to set up a strategy and not to put it off until next year. How can we stem the flow of closures and sales of our Canadian companies? Perhaps by handing them over to our local people? Perhaps a movement should be started up to form cooperatives and to hand them over to people in the regions with the ability to handle their own production. We ought to be able to create jobs in our regions rather than watching businesses close one after the other. Governments try to boast about their good track record, but there are places out there where things are not working out. In some parts of Canada, the rural areas have been forgotten. </ParaText><ParaText id="767082">It is to be hoped that measures will be put in place to help those who have lost jobs, whether at Fils Fins, in the forest industry or in some other sector.</ParaText>

The reason why the government does not want to give this bill the royal recommendation is that it thinks all is well in Canada.

Because the Bloc Québécois decided that it could not accept the fact that the finance minister's economic statement had nothing to say about the manufacturing and forestry crisis in Canada. This is old news.</ParaText><ParaText id="767103">Nearly a year ago, in February 2007, the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology issued a unanimous report entitled “Manufacturing: Moving Forward--Rising to the Challenge”. The committee chair, who is the Conservative member for <Affiliation DbId="78709" Type="2">Edmonton- Leduc</Affiliation>, and all the committee members from all parties decided that this report deserved the government's support.</ParaText><ParaText id="767104">Here is an excerpt from the report, which was released nearly a year ago, in February 2007:</ParaText><ParaText id="767105"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">While the rest of the Canadian economy is generally very robust, many industries within the manufacturing sector are struggling to remain competitive against the backdrop of a Canadian dollar that has risen in value by more than 40% in just four years in comparison to its American counterpart, rising and unpredictable energy costs, increasing global competition, particularly from China and India, and excessive and inefficiently designed regulations, to name but a few challenges.</QuotePara></Quote>

							<ParaText id="767106">The report also said:</ParaText><ParaText id="767107"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The Committee believes that the Government of Canada should make the preservation of a competitive Canadian manufacturing sector a national goal, and that given the gravity of the challenges facing the sector, the recommendations presented in this report should be implemented in a timely fashion. </QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText><ParaText id="767108">The Bloc Québécois members of the committee, of which I was one, supported this report in good faith, because it contained a comprehensive industrial strategy Canada needed in order to give the manufacturing industry a chance. Now, in November 2007, nearly one year later, and especially in the wake of the economic statement in which the government ignored all the committee's recommendations, half of one recommendation on accelerated depreciation was included in the most recent budget. There are still 21 and a half recommendations to be implemented, but the government's current attitude does not give us much hope that this will happen.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767109">The government is acting like the economy is doing well. It keeps saying that the unemployment rate has gone down. In my riding, when people systematically go from jobs that pay $15, $18, $20 or $22 an hour to jobs that pay $8, $10 or $12 an hour, things are not so rosy. In my riding, since the 2006 election alone, Bermatex in the textile industry has closed, as have Consoltex, and Baronet in Beauce and a sawmill in Saint-Juste-de-Bretenière. Whirlpool closed as well, just before that period in 2006. Hundreds of jobs have been lost. The Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology tabled a unanimous report on this—with support from all parties—but the government is still unable to follow through. We wonder why this is so. Maybe it is just the Conservatives who are currently in government who think nothing needs to be done.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767110">I have an excerpt of comments made by Mr. Poloz, Senior Vice-President Corporate Affairs and Chief Economist at EDC, Export Development Canada, “Canada’s overall export sector is having a tough go, with growth minimal during the past four years”. Minimal during the past four years! The Conservatives went so far as to add, on page 28 of the finance minister's economic statement, a chart entitled, “Real GDP Growth by Sector Since December 2005”. There is only one sector that has had positive growth and that is the oil sector. All the other sectors, machines, paper and printing, plastics, rubber and metal products, food and beverage, primary processing of metals, textiles, clothing and leather, wood, furniture and non-metallic mineral products, cars and parts, all these sectors have experienced negative growth and it is getting worse.</ParaText>

This is not a problem that cropped up yesterday morning; this problem has been around for many years and was raised unanimously by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, by members from all the parties, including Conservative members and the chair of the committee himself, who made the observations I mentioned earlier.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp><ParaText id="767114">That is not all. Recently, the Premier of Quebec and the Premier of Ontario said the same thing, that is, that the federal government must do its part.

How can the Prime Minister say the country's economy is as solid as the Canadian Shield, when thousands of jobs have been lost in the manufacturing and forestry sectors, and even more are threatened by the soaring loonie? Of course, the Prime Minister cannot interfere in the responsibilities of the Bank of Canada. It is a fact: it is not up to politicians, but rather, the Bank of Canada to determine monetary policy and set interest rates.</QuotePara></Quote>

							<ParaText id="767116">He could use any number of means. There is the entire report produced by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. The report is there; all he had to do was act on it. All he had to do was have the Minister of Finance say, with complete logic, based on page 30 of the economic statement, that in order to address these problems, to tackle them and find solutions, he would implement a number of the recommendations unanimously passed by the members of this House. However, he has not had the courage to do so.</ParaText><ParaText id="767117">What is the underlying reason? I can think of only one. The Conservative government is only interested in promoting the oil and gas companies. Indeed, that sector's economy is doing very well at this time. Canada currently has a two tier economy. There is the economy of the west, where oil and gas companies are growing very rapidly, and the economy of the east, in Quebec and Ontario, where things are very difficult in the manufacturing sector. It is quite surprising and rather appalling that the Conservative government has not seen any measure it could take, among the many recommendations made by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. I would like to come back to this, because I think it is very important to do so.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767118">Here are more objections. In a letter addressed to the federal Minister of Finance, Jean-Paul Gagné, who is an editorial writer for the newspaper <I>Les Affaires</I>, wrote: However, allow me to tell you once again that these tax cuts are ill suited. The Prime Minister, who holds a master of economy, and yourself must have learned in university that lowering the GST promotes consumption, but that includes to a large extent imported goods, and this does little for Canada's economic growth.</ParaText><ParaText id="767119">People have come to realize that lowering the GST by 1 point results in a direct transfer of money to China. This measure did nothing to help our manufacturing industry be competitive and make goods that can be sold at competitive prices. In no way did the Conservative government act to promote that. Rather, the result was a total free market, which means that we are almost subsidizing employment abroad, and that is totally unacceptable.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767120">But let me get back to what Mr. Gagné was telling the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>: You put political considerations before economic governance and cooperative federalism. The future of several provinces, and even that of the country, is in jeopardy, because public authorities are not investing enough in education and innovation.</ParaText><ParaText id="767121">So, there is a general opposition to this measure, including by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, the Premier of Quebec, the Premier of Ontario, the editorial writer, and particularly the people who are going through tough times in each of the companies that we visited.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767122">Last week, during the break, we heard everywhere news about sawmills going through very difficult times and about the forest industry needing some action by the federal government. As far as the manufacturing sector is concerned, there have been similar messages, but the government has in no way started to move in that direction.</ParaText><ParaText id="767123">That is why, today, the Bloc Québécois has brought this motion before the House. We hope to have the support of a vast majority of members in this House, Liberals, New Democrats and Conservatives who also encounter this reality in their ridings. There are indeed Conservatives in Quebec who depend on the forest industry and who want the federal government to be told to go back to the drawing board. They think this is important. They want us to let the government know that the economic statement does not deal with the real problems, that there are deep problems and that the government has the financial margin to tackle these problems. In fact, the government has billions of dollars to do that and has the industrial strategy proposed by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. The government as a whole has this ability. The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance must go back to the drawing board and make sure that we will not have to face tomorrow a disaster caused by the Conservative government.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The chairman of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology is a Conservative. Four Conservative members were in favour of implementing the recommendations contained in this unanimous committee report, but the Conservative government did absolutely nothing to follow up on that.</ParaText><ParaText id="767141">Was it a mistake on the part of the members or did the government not take its responsibilities?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I would appreciate it if our colleagues would do the same today out of respect for this House. </ParaText><ParaText id="767144">Earlier, my colleague clearly showed that this obvious political choice on the part of the Conservative Party is based on the same pillars as those used by the Bush government in the United States. This means that the strength of the economy must come from the military industry and the oil industry, as my colleague so aptly illustrated. Right now, oil is to our economy what EPO is to some athletes who resort to doping. It is the only industry that gives some impetus to the Canadian economy since all other sectors are in trouble, particularly the manufacturing and forestry sectors.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767145"> I would say to our colleagues from Quebec in the Conservative party—and I would say the same thing to the Liberals—that, when we, the Bloc Québécois, appear at any meetings or gatherings, people tell us all the time that we look as though we are working very hard. I always tell them that, in the Bloc Québécois, we have to work hard because we are working for 75 members, even though there are only 49 of us. Why? It is because there are federalist party members who are definitely working against the interests of the population, who are primarily concerned about the interests of the powerful, especially the oil companies. It is true. This is about more than just grandstanding.</ParaText><ParaText id="767146"> My colleague said so awhile ago. Look at page 30 of the economic statement. All industrial sectors are there. At present, the only one that gets ongoing financial support from the Canadian government is the oil industry, those I would call the oil barons.</ParaText><ParaText id="767147"> Meanwhile, in Quebec, our economy is based heavily on the manufacturing sector. The manufacturing sector is so crucial that in Quebec there are three times more revenues generated by the manufacturing sector than what Alberta, for example, produces through the oil industry, that is, 536,000 jobs with a payroll of $22 billion.</ParaText><ParaText id="767148"> This is the economic impact the manufacturing sector has in Quebec, a sector that accounts for 90% of international exports. Thus, of the $69 billion in exports, $63 billion comes from the manufacturing sector. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767149"> The production of goods generates the most wealth in Quebec. But when measures to revitalize the manufacturing sector are not accepted, this amounts to policies that run completely counter to Quebec’s interests.</ParaText><ParaText id="767150"> To illustrate my remarks, I remind the House that 135,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost in Quebec, or the equivalent of one worker in five, since December 31, 2002. That is 65,000 jobs lost since the arrival of the Conservatives.</ParaText><ParaText id="767151"> This morning our colleagues listed the measures designed to help the manufacturing sector. It would have been far better if they had not put them in place because I get the impression that the measures they have taken have done more harm than good to the manufacturing sector.</ParaText><ParaText id="767152"> One colleague said: “Do not tell us what has happened, tell us what you are going to do.” You made a commitment—and you are doing so again today—to provide help for the manufacturing sector, but you are not announcing anything.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp><ParaText id="767153"> The Bloc’s motion, put forward today, has the advantage of getting each party to take a position to ensure concrete measures with a view to helping the manufacturing sector. In Quebec, some 275,000 jobs have been lost in the manufacturing sector alone.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767154"> Let us speak now of the forestry crisis. From May 2002 to April 2005, a total of 10,000 jobs were lost in sawmills and paper mills. That was before 2005. Since April 2005, 21,000 more jobs have been lost. This is the Conservatives. The last MPs elected in byelections were Conservative members. I come back to this often, because it is important for citizens to realize that there are people in this House who got themselves elected on platforms which clearly distorted the truth. The member for<Affiliation DbId="113961" Type="2">Roberval—Lac-Saint-Jean</Affiliation> got himself elected by telling the forestry industry that he would help it out, by asking it to bring him to power in this government. His first speech in the House was concerned with idolizing his leader. He spoke about “a certain Albertan”. He used just about every term available to sing his praises, but no terms to describe the measures that had to be taken to give some dignity to the people he represents in his constituency. The only way to give that dignity is to propose concrete measures for the forestry industry. </ParaText><ParaText id="767155"> Those concrete measures can be found in the motion. Here are the solutions: better tax support for research and development, particular attention to the resource regions, investment in development of new products. We could have filled pages with them, but managed to summarize things in a single motion. Will they vote for this today? This is the hour of truth for the people who got themselves elected on the promise to help out these workers and these entrepreneurs.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767156"> Earlier, a colleague was talking about employment insurance. We have just proposed concrete measures to help out the industry. However, when workers suffer inevitable job losses, they are willing to go back to work. They are brave people who want to work. So they go and take courses and attend back-to-work sessions, when there are jobs. But what happens when there are none?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767157"> They have been beset by two misfortunes. First, they were faced with a Liberal government that destroyed the employment insurance program. Then, the Conservative government went back on its commitments, namely that it would restore the employment insurance program, specifically by setting up an independent employment insurance fund so that the government would stop dipping into the fund for other purposes. However, there are older workers who no longer have an income, who find themselves on welfare, even though they have contributed to employment insurance all their life. The Liberal government eliminated the POWA, and the Conservatives promised to restore it. However they are maintaining the position of the Liberal government. </ParaText><ParaText id="767158"> It is the same thing with employment insurance. At the end of this month, we will have the second hour of debate at third reading of Bill <Document DbId="3073177" Type="4">C-269, An Act to amend the Employment Insurance Act (improvement of the employment insurance system)</Document>. This bill is intended to restore the employment insurance system by providing benefits to people who have contributed to the fund and who are the only ones, with their employers, who have done so. And all the money needed to do this is there. In fact, there is another $3,300,000,000 surplus this year, so we have what is needed to be able to meet the obligations of Bill <Document DbId="3073177" Type="4">C-269</Document>. And yet the government continues to impose constraints on workers who lose their jobs.</ParaText><ParaText id="767159"> I in turn invite my colleagues to vote for this motion, so that this government will take concrete steps to help these two sectors, manufacturing and forestry, to get out of this crisis. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Canadians voted for a government with clear priorities, for leadership, for accountability and for action, which is exactly what the Conservative government has done. This government stepped up to the plate, assumed its responsibilities and is getting the job done. </ParaText><ParaText id="767180">Because of the leadership of our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, Canada's economy has never been stronger. Despite the rhetoric of the opposition parties, Canada's economy is rock solid. Contrast this to most of our closest trading partners that are experiencing economic uncertainty and flirting with recession.</ParaText><ParaText id="767181">Canadians now enjoy the lowest unemployment rate in 33 years, 5.8%, which includes the lowest unemployment rate in years for Quebec. This year alone overall employment in Canada has increased by nearly 350,000 jobs and most of these are full time, high quality, good paying jobs. Business investment is expanding and we are experiencing the second longest economic expansion in our nation's history. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767182">We are the only country in the G-7 that has ongoing budget surpluses and a falling debt burden. As our government continues to pay down our debt, we will ensure that the interest payment savings are returned to hard-working Canadians in the form of tax cuts, similar to the $60 billion tax cuts announcement made by the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> just two weeks ago, which, by the way, the hypocritical Bloc voted against.</ParaText><ParaText id="767183">Our economy continues to grow at a solid pace. During the second quarter of 2007, the Canadian economy grew by 3.4% and following first quarter growth of 3.1%. Private sector forecasters expect continued solid growth over the next five years. The world is bullish on Canada and with good reason. </ParaText><ParaText id="767184">Who is responsible for this success? The answer is very simple. Canadians from all walks of life and across all communities, those who every day are developing and adding value to our resource industries, those working in our manufacturing industries, those innovating and developing in our schools and universities, those maintaining our critical infrastructure, our construction industry and those other Canadians who provide the goods and services that make this nation what it is today.</ParaText><ParaText id="767185">It is thanks to these Canadians that we can stand up with pride and say that Canadians from coast to coast to coast are building a better, safer and stronger Canada.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767186">What was the role of the Bloc Québécois in attaining these economic feats? The answer is and forever will be that of a bench warmer. The Bloc will always be relegated to the opposition benches and will never be able to deliver a single result for la belle province.</ParaText><ParaText id="767187">In stark contrast to the party that will always be in proverbial opposition, this government understands the vital role played by the manufacturing sector. We have acknowledged its challenges and have delivered meaningful results.</ParaText><ParaText id="767188">Manufacturers employ over two million Canadians in our cities and in our rural communities, in small businesses as well as in large firms. Manufacturing directly represents one-sixth of our economy. The economic spin-offs from this important industry reverberate throughout the entire economy. Without a doubt, a strong manufacturing sector is crucial to a vibrant national economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="767189">If the Bloc had researched the topic, it would have realized that nearly everything in its motion has already been addressed by either the industry committee's manufacturing report or one of the Conservative government's major economic or innovation announcements.</ParaText><ParaText id="767190">The industry, science and technology committee, which included two Bloc members, heard first-hand how this vital sector has faced challenges over the past several years, including higher and more volatile commodity prices, intense international competition and a slowing United States economy. On top of this, Canadian manufacturers have had to adjust to the sharp rise in the value of the Canadian dollar.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767191">Last February, my good friend and colleague, the member <Affiliation DbId="78709" Type="2">Edmonton—Leduc</Affiliation> and chairman of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. presented the results of our committee study on the challenges facing Canadian manufacturers. The committee heard from over 100 witnesses and, thanks to the hard work of the member for Edmonton--Leduc, the committee produced 22 unanimous recommendations to our government. These recommendations cover taxation, energy, labour, trade and intellectual property rights protection, as well as regulatory, infrastructure, research and development and commercialization policies. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp><ParaText id="767192">What was the response of the Conservative government? In budget 2007, we successfully delivered on 21 of 22 of the recommendations, which is why many consider budget 2007 the most manufacturing friendly budget ever delivered. Long before the Bloc conceived this petty attempt at playing politics with this critical sector, our government delivered meaningful results. </ParaText><ParaText id="767193">Our response, “Manufacturing: Moving Forward - Rising to the Challenge”, was a comprehensive and overwhelmingly positive report, demonstrating our commitment to manufacturers, their employees and the communities in which they live. Our response demonstrates leadership and a willingness to act with urgency at a time when manufacturers need it most.</ParaText><ParaText id="767194">The government's response was quick and decisive and spoke directly to the needs of manufacturers. Our response delivered immediate tax relief. It secured Canada's place as a leader in the production and use of clean and renewable energy sources through strategic investments. It introduced new initiatives and improvements to existing programs to help ensure that Canadian manufacturers have access to a highly skilled and a well educated workforce. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767195">Last November, the government set in motion its long term economic plan to create five advantages to improve the quality of life and succeed on the world stage: first, a tax advantage that reduces taxes for all Canadians in establishing the lowest tax rate on new business investment in the G-7; second, a fiscal advantage that eliminates Canada's total government debt in less than a generation; third, an entrepreneurial advantage that reduces unnecessary regulation and red tape and increases competition in the Canadian marketplace; fourth, a knowledge advantage that creates the best educated, most skilled and most flexible workforce in the world; fifth, an infrastructure advantage to build the most modern infrastructure that we need; and, sixth, to build a tax advantage, budget 2007 spoke directly to the needs of Canadian manufacturers by introducing tax measures and initiatives that benefit them.</ParaText><ParaText id="767196">First and foremost, the Conservative government provided a shot of adrenalin to manufacturers by delivering on the number one recommendation of the industry committee report and Canadian manufacturers and exporters of an accelerated capital cost allowance for the purchase of machinery and equipment, allowing for a two year writeoff on these investments. We also increased the capital cost allowance rate for buildings used in manufacturing or processing to 10% from 4%, as well as for other assets. These measures will allow our manufacturers to invest in the buildings, machinery and equipment that will help them remain innovative, productive and competitive.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767197">Budget 2007 also accelerated the elimination of the federal capital tax by two years and eliminated the corporate surtax for all corporations. Again, it was this Conservative government that delivered these measures, while the Bloc will always play the benchwarmer.</ParaText><ParaText id="767198">Two weeks ago, in his economic statement to the nation, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> announced that our government would further stimulate the manufacturing and processing sectors with additional corporate tax reductions that will provide $2.6 billion in tax relief. This was another bold fiscal measure that was praised by Canadian manufacturers and exporters, again another measure the Bloc could never deliver because it will always be in opposition.</ParaText><ParaText id="767199">Our bold new tax reduction initiative will lower the general corporate income tax rate to 15% by 2012 from the current rate of 22.1%. With these tax reductions in place, Canada will achieve the lowest overall tax rate on new business investment in the G-7 by 2011 and the lowest corporate statutory income tax rate in the G-7 by 2012. These measures were welcomed by business and manufacturers as an extremely important step in building upon Canada's ability to compete internationally to retain and attract new business investments.</ParaText><ParaText id="767200">The commitment to eliminate Canada's net debt within a generation will provide for further tax relief in the future. Our Conservative government has committed to return any interest savings from reducing debt back to Canadians directly in the form of lower taxes.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767201">It is imperative to note the height of the Bloc's hypocrisy at this point. Despite the Conservative government providing lower corporate, business and personal taxes, two weeks ago the Bloc stood in this House and voted against each of the measures that will provide substantive assistance to manufacturers when they need it most.</ParaText><ParaText id="767202">This government has delivered many other measures and initiatives that are enhancing Canada's economy and assisting manufacturers. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp><ParaText id="767203">A major element of our plan to build an entrepreneurial advantage is to relieve businesses from the paper burden imposed by bureaucracies, which is why we are cutting red tape for small and medium sized companies that often bear a proportionately higher regulatory cost than the larger companies.</ParaText><ParaText id="767204">Last month, my colleagues, the <Affiliation DbId="105829" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="111562" Type="4">Secretary of State for Small Business and Tourism</Affiliation>, took another giant leap toward the reduction of red tape for businesses by eliminating 80,000 requirements and obligations in 13 key regulatory departments and agencies. Our goal is to reduce the federal paperwork burden for businesses by 20% by November 2008. Again, a measure the Bloc will never deliver for Quebec manufacturers.</ParaText><ParaText id="767205">Another important initiative the government has provided was the announcement of the competition policy review panel as promised in budget 2007 last July. The creation of this panel is another example of how this government is taking seriously Canada's economic place in the world and another sad reminder of the uselessness of the Bloc.</ParaText><ParaText id="767206">Last week, the competition policy review panel released its consultation paper “Sharpening Canada's Competitive Edge”.

In my country, Quebec, these sectors are going through a serious crisis. In my area and in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="78488" Type="2">Gatineau</Affiliation>, in the Outaouais region, we can feel their pain.</ParaText><ParaText id="767266"> At the Domtar plant located in Gatineau, in the Outaouais region, there are only 70 active workers remaining to provide electric, steam and sewer services to the neighbouring Kruger plant. At the end of October, 180 out of the 250 Domtar employees were laid off. They were producing coated paper for magazines. </ParaText><ParaText id="767267">The union and the revitalization committee are continuing to work relentlessly to get this federal government to help the plant keep its machinery operational, so that an eventual buyer can take over and restart production, and thus, give back jobs to the papermakers who were cut loose last month. They are asking that the federal government help that plant as it did the Davie shipbuilding plant in Lauzon, near Quebec City, in the early 2000s, by keeping the machinery up to standard. That was successful over there, and the Davie Shipyard was revitalized. We wish the same for Domtar in Gatineau.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767268">Incidentally, the <Affiliation DbId="111555" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> will meet later today with union representatives from that plant, namely Gene Hartley and Gérard Carrière, as well as myself. We will try to enlist the support of the current government in our efforts, as the workers from Davie, in Lauzon, did. I cannot imagine the Domtar plant in Gatineau shutting down completely. The 400 employees of the Kruger plant, also in Gatineau, which depends on the three services Domtar continues to provide, might also fall victim to the current crisis in the paper industry. </ParaText><ParaText id="767269">I think of the Bowater plant, located in my riding. This paper plant employed 1,450 workers in 1991. Today, there are only 425. Last March, 171 papermakers were laid off. As Gaston Carrière, union leader and president of Local 142 of the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada, pointed out, in February 2007, the multinational announced to the employees operating machine No. 3 that the machine would be temporarily idled for 30 days. One week before production was to resume, Bowater announced that machine No. 3 would be idled indefinitely.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767270">At a press conference in June 2007, Mr. Carrière said he saw employees with 25 to 30 years of service in tears. In this case, the Conservative government's program for older workers did not pay a single cent to those individuals. It is a trumped-up program whose criteria are so strict that one would have to live on Saturn to access it. </ParaText><ParaText id="767271">That is the current state of the manufacturing and forestry crisis. It is extremely difficult for the workers who have been affected, as well as their family and community. The Bloc Québécois would like to play an active role in boosting these industrial sectors.

These loans, which would be made available to companies at the market rate for financially healthy companies, would be especially useful to companies in financial difficulty that cannot easily borrow on private markets or have to pay a risk premium, which adds to their interest charges.</ParaText>

I would like to point out that aluminum smelters and forest-dependent businesses have made important efforts to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.</ParaText><ParaText id="767280">Let us also think about modernizing the trade legislation to better protect businesses against unfair competition. The Canadian antidumping legislation goes back to the Cold War era and is completely outdated in the present context, particularly as we face the competition from China.

This is something of great concern to the population of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, and more particularly the workers of the forestry sector. </ParaText><ParaText id="767546"> For some time now, the Bloc Québécois has been demanding concrete measures to help the manufacturing and forestry sectors. The Liberal and Conservative governments in recent years have ignored the grave crisis suffered by many resource regions in Quebec. </ParaText><ParaText id="767547"> I would like to take the few minutes given me to say more about the forestry sector, which affects many thousands of individuals in my region, and the measures that could be taken to mitigate this crisis. </ParaText><ParaText id="767548"> The forestry crisis afflicting Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean and many other regions of Quebec is far from being solved. The Conservatives claim to have invested a few million dollars in the forestry sector. These measures are clearly inadequate in light of the economic crisis that is deeply affecting the resource regions of Quebec and Canada. And the rise of over 25% in the Canadian dollar since the beginning of the year, in relation to the American dollar, is becoming a double blow for the people. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767549"> The merger a few months ago of Abitibi-Consol and Bowater is in some ways a consequence of this crisis. At present, no reorganization plan has been presented by the American company in spite of the numerous concerns of the population and the workers of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean. </ParaText><ParaText id="767550"> The new company will have some 5,500 employees in the region and will control close to 75% of the forestry resources. It will have to make some important economic decisions. These are two companies in financial difficulty that have merged. Many are expecting job cuts in view of the crisis affecting the forestry sector. </ParaText><ParaText id="767551"> With the emergence of wood from China and new industry conditions, many companies will have to carry out major lay-offs in the coming months if no measures are put in place by the Conservative government. </ParaText><ParaText id="767552"> Recently local leaders and several heads of sawmills, including those at Petit-Saguenay, Saint-Fulgence, Roberval and Saint-Félicien, have said they are worried about their future. Bad news is regularly heard. I give you some examples. Last week, Abitibi-Consol announced the lay-off of some 80 workers from the LP engineered wood plant in Larouche, in addition to the announced closing of the Scierie Lemay, which will affect 83 employees by the end of November. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767553"> In a number of communities in my region and in <Affiliation DbId="78427" Type="2">Chicoutimi—Le Fjord</Affiliation>, the effect of the crisis in recent years is already being felt. One of the largest forestry cooperatives in Quebec, located in Laterrière, went bankrupt in 2004. That bankruptcy has had an indirect impact on many sawmills in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean. The six forestry cooperatives in my region have lost 1,000 jobs in the last seven years. </ParaText><ParaText id="767554"> What this means is that the two Conservative members for my region, the members for <Affiliation DbId="78609" Type="2">Jonquière—Alma</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="113961" Type="2">Roberval—Lac-Saint-Jean</Affiliation>, have to stand up for the interests of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, as I am doing today. Their silence is unacceptable. They have a duty to persuade this Conservative <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">prime minister</Affiliation> to propose a plan to combat this crisis. </ParaText><ParaText id="767555"> The Bloc Québécois has been trying for several months to get the Conservative government to grasp the reality of this crisis in forestry.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="05">(1505)</Timestamp><ParaText id="767556"> The Conservative government has to implement concrete measures to help the forestry industry. The Conservative government has just announced billions of dollars in income tax cuts for high earners, oil companies and banks, but it is not doing anything about the forestry crisis. Its inaction proves that it does not realize the extent of the crisis and that it is abandoning the workers and businesses in the forestry industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="767557"> At present, several thousand jobs have been lost or are threatened, primarily because of this government’s inertia, even though the Bloc Québécois has proposed genuine solutions to help this industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="767558"> First, the government has to bring back the fund to diversity forest economies. When the <Affiliation DbId="78745" Type="4">Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec</Affiliation> cut diversification funding for the regions hit by the forestry crisis by $50 million dollars, he caused a major setback for the industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="767559"> One of the things that program did was provide assistance to communities affected by the crisis. It was a mistake to slash that kind of program and that kind of assistance. A program of that nature has to be restored, but with more financial resources.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767560"> Second, the Bloc Québécois has proposed that a loan and loan guarantee program be created to help to finance investments in production equipment. This would provide support for businesses that wish to update their production equipment or simply enable their businesses to expand.</ParaText><ParaText id="767561"> Third, the Bloc has suggested that taxes be reduced for businesses in the manufacturing and forestry sector to help them expand, or that tax credits be given to encourage hiring. The Conservative government is playing down the impact of the forestry crisis that is hitting the regions of Quebec broadside when it should be providing them with immediate assistance.</ParaText><ParaText id="767562"> And fourth, the Bloc has for several years been calling for an income support program for older workers. These workers are in a state of despair because there has been no assistance for them. Entire communities are being affected by these lost earnings.</ParaText><ParaText id="767563"> The government of Quebec has made efforts to help older workers, but those efforts will be inadequate as long as Ottawa does not do its part. In a sovereign Quebec, we would have our own money, all of our own taxes, and Quebec would be able to provide its people and its workers with a POWA.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767564">Workers over 55 have difficulty finding another job. They cannot benefit from adequate assistance. Yet, this program would only cost $75 million a year for all of Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="767565">These few measures are aimed at helping the forest industry to make the transition toward secondary and tertiary processing. This transition will lead to high value added manufacturing and ensure that each tree will provide the most jobs. </ParaText><ParaText id="767566">We need to realize that almost 21,000 jobs have been lost in the forestry sector in Quebec since April  1<Sup>st</Sup>, 2005, almost 4,000 in my region alone, Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean. We know that, in Quebec, forestry is the main employer in 260 towns and villages and that, in 134 of them, forestry provides 100% of all jobs. Thus, it is important to ensure the viability of this industry. </ParaText><ParaText id="767567">It is undeniable that the forestry crisis is causing major job losses. It also has impacts on youth. A study conducted by the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean youth centre suggests that the uncertainty in the forest industry has repercussions on youth from the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean region. This is another serious aspect of this crisis. </ParaText>

As a result, thousands of jobs were lost in Quebec, particularly in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue and Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean regions. Because of this ill-considered support from the Bloc Québécois, the Conservative Party put in place a softwood lumber agreement for which Quebec workers ended up paying a very high price.</ParaText><ParaText id="767573">Today, the Bloc is putting forward a motion which, at first sight, seems to make sense. The motion talks about measures to be taken in the forest industry. However, just as all other provinces in Canada, Quebec can no longer take measures to help communities hard hit by the forestry crisis, since the softwood lumber agreement gave Washington a decision-making power.</ParaText><ParaText id="767574">The Bloc is trying to clean up the mess.

I am glad that it has been brought forth to the House. The motion indicates: “That, in the opinion of the House, the government should immediately establish a series of measures to help the manufacturing and forestry sectors hard hit by the rising dollar and increased competition”.</ParaText><ParaText id="767586">However, I feel the motion fails to address the government's inaction and its flawed policies. I will speak to those two specific issues in my remarks.</ParaText><ParaText id="767587">If we look at the fact that the government has taken no action to address how to promote productivity and competitiveness, it is clearly apparent that it has ignored the recommendations made by the industry committee, which made 22 key recommendations focusing on productivity and competitiveness. The government has no real and comprehensive plan in place.</ParaText><ParaText id="767588">It is our party, under our leadership, which has demonstrated to the Canadian public that, going forward, Canada as a trading nation needs to be more competitive and needs to have a productivity agenda. We need to make sure we can compete in a North American environment and with an emerging Asian economy and other established unions and economies.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767589">Let us look at the government's flawed policies. Especially, let us examine forestry. I have had the opportunity to travel the country and visit many sectors impacted by forestry. Many industries, families, workers, people and companies have been directly impacted by the flawed softwood lumber agreement signed by the Conservative government.</ParaText><ParaText id="767590">We have, for example, the current environment, with a strong Canadian dollar that is on the rise. We also have a decline in the softwood lumber price and a decline in the demand for forestry products and softwood lumber products because of a slowdown in the U.S. housing market. What did the government do? It signed a flawed deal that effectively forced companies to pay higher taxes and also to make sure that they were a part of and subject to quotas.</ParaText><ParaText id="767591">More importantly, there is another issue that has not been addressed. That is the pine beetle infestation. Here is what bothers me after all of this, after we gave up a billion dollars and a broken promise from the Conservative government: it promised it would collect the duties but it only collected 80¢ on the dollar. We basically undermined all our NAFTA and WTO rulings. What did we get in return? As I said, we got higher taxes and quotas. We are back in the courts after seven months of a seven year deal and, most importantly and what Canadians need to realize, we have compromised our sovereignty.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767592">As a nation, the government has no authority and now no ability to work with the forestry sector. Any time it takes that upon itself, if it chooses to do so, it will be sued by the United States and by the U.S. softwood lumber coalition. It is an example of a clear-cut flawed policy with respect to forestry.</ParaText><ParaText id="767593">The government also has a very wrong-headed approach when it comes to manufacturing. I will speak to a specific example with respect to the South Korea free trade agreement. The minister has indicated that he wants to rush this deal through. He wants to champion this issue very quickly. I have been given absolutely no reason to understand why this is the case. Let us look at the sheer merits of the deal.</ParaText><ParaText id="767594"> We currently have a trade deficit with South Korea. South Korea has a very protectionist culture. If we look at the 1995 and 1998 memoranda of understanding with South Korea and the United States, we see that it has completely gone back on its word. Let us take the auto sector, where there is a large disparity. South Korea sells 400 cars in our market versus the one vehicle we sell in its market and has imports as only 2% of the car market in South Korea.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767595">The Liberal Party has been absolutely clear on this. Throughout the summer, our leader toured Ontario. He visited many cities and toured many manufacturing facilities. He talked to many people in the auto sector and, more importantly, to companies that rely on the auto sector. He came to the conclusion that we will not support any flawed South Korea free trade agreement. We want to make sure that non-tariff barriers are addressed. We want to make sure there is a proper dispute mechanism in place.

								<Query></Query></ParaText><ParaText id="767598">I would like to ask the minister to take the opportunity to visit these facilities. I find such a remark very discouraging and disappointing because it undermines our hard-working Canadians. The minister should tell that to the people at the Chrysler plant in Brampton where 1,100 people lost their jobs. What is more important to realize is that not only did those people lose their jobs but it affected their families, and the companies that rely on that large auto assembly plant. This is absolutely discouraging and it needs to be addressed.</ParaText><ParaText id="767599">These are some of the salient points that were not mentioned in the motion. </ParaText><ParaText id="767600">The Conservative government has developed no comprehensive action plan. The government really has a flawed policy when it comes to forestry and manufacturing. An example would be the softwood lumber agreement, and I highlighted some of the concerns with that. The other issue is the South Korea free trade agreement.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767601"> In my opinion, what is even more troubling is the Conservative government's track record of being counter-productive when it comes to improving our manufacturing sector abroad. We are a trading nation. We need to make sure we have open and accessible markets abroad. What does the government do? It closes key consulate offices in key markets in Japan and Milan, for example. These are areas where we need to make sure that we have a presence, where we can sell our products, and where we can brand Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="767602">The government has cut and cancelled many programs. One of the initiatives was the Canada trade program, which was a very important comprehensive package that dealt with small and medium sized enterprises to look and examine ways where we could make our companies competitive, where we could make sure that we exposed our manufacturing above and beyond the North American borders abroad, and we could make sure that we retained good, high quality paying Canadian jobs. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767603">This really is troublesome if we look at the overall job market situation. For example, let us look at forestry. Roughly 300,000 jobs are directly impacted by the forestry industry. These jobs are in decline on a daily basis. We have close to 550,000 jobs in the auto manufacturing sector, for example. Most important, there are about 7.5 spin-off jobs. For every one job that we lose, we lose 7.5 jobs. Those are thousands of jobs. </ParaText><ParaText id="767604">I visited some communities that totally and absolutely rely on a mill because it is very much integrated into the forestry sector. Some towns, for example, Windsor, Brampton, and many places in southwestern Ontario, rely heavily on manufacturing. For every one job that they lose, approximately 8 spin-off jobs are lost. </ParaText><ParaText id="767605">These job losses are going to devastate these communities. This is going to devastate hard-working families. This is going to devastate the local economy. The government has turned its head the other way. If anything, it is going to accelerate the process by signing a flawed South Korea free trade agreement. More important, the government has completely tied its hands with respect to the softwood lumber agreement. </ParaText><ParaText id="767606">We have completely compromised our sovereignty. What bothers me is that Canadians have elected this minority Parliament and this particular make up to ensure that this Parliament works to protect and preserve good paying Canadian jobs, not to compromise our sovereignty. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767607">I think it is absolutely disheartening and disappointing to see the Conservative government ignore these two vital industries that employ thousands of people, that help generate thousands of jobs, and that help generate millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars, in tax revenue. </ParaText><ParaText id="767608">At the end of the day the issue is about trust. This motion speaks to the fact that Canadians cannot trust the government to protect good paying Canadian jobs. People in this country cannot trust the Conservative government to fight for our sovereignty and to protect our sovereignty. The government is absolutely out of the game when it comes to forestry. It cannot do anything. Anytime it takes an action to help the forestry sector, it will be sued. That is the kind of policy the government has developed. It is trying to appease our neighbours to the south and in doing so we are going to lose thousands of jobs. </ParaText><ParaText id="767609">Both industries are in crisis and this motion speaks to that today. I hope the government is listening to this and will take action.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

This is not the way to respond to an urgent crisis.</ParaText><ParaText id="767627">This country has lost upwards of 175,000 manufacturing jobs in the past three years. The high dollar has clearly compounded this reality.</ParaText><ParaText id="767628">We have only to look to the recent announcement by the Chrysler Corporation that it would be cutting 1,100 jobs at the Brampton, Ontario, plant as evidence that this situation is only getting worse.</ParaText><ParaText id="767629">In fact, Gerry Fedchun of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association stated quite clearly this reality when he said recently, “It just gets worse and worse”.</ParaText>

In fact, the Canadian Auto Workers are promoting a campaign across the country called, “Manufacturing Matters”. They are right. Manufacturing does matter.</ParaText><ParaText id="767633">These are good jobs that are being lost and the government simply ignores the pleas of so many Canadians who are losing their means to support their families and their communities in this country.

He further states, “It's pretty desperate times out there”.</ParaText><ParaText id="767637">It has been noted by the Quebec Federation of Labour that up to 10,000 jobs have already been lost in the forestry sector in the province of Quebec.

							<ParaText id="767663">Today's debate is of particular interest to me, because I represent a riding that has suffered from the crisis in the manufacturing sector. Indeed, since 2003, the riding of <Affiliation DbId="78483" Type="2">Beauharnois—Salaberry</Affiliation> has suffered a direct loss of 2,500 jobs. In a community like mine, the impact of such a loss is almost similar to that of a bomb. It is rather catastrophic for my constituents.</ParaText><ParaText id="767664">I will give a few examples. It started with the closure of textile plants in the town of Huntingdon. We talked about it a lot in this House. Among other things, we asked for an income support program for older workers, for the workers who worked very hard in the textile plants and who unfortunately, to this day, four years after the closure, still have not been able to retrain in order to find another job and are now looking at a rather depressing retirement, and a very precarious one from a financial point of view. </ParaText><ParaText id="767665">Then there is the closure of Gildan, another textile plant located in Salaberry-de-Valleyfield. Recently, we witnessed yet another plant closure which really hurt, namely that of the Goodyear plant, in Valleyfield. The closure of that tire plant alone resulted in the loss of 1,000 jobs. In addition to that, Les Abattoirs Z. Billette, Quebec's only steer slaughterhouse, closed its doors, which resulted in the loss of another 230 jobs in the town of Saint-Louis-de-Gonzague, in the riding of <Affiliation DbId="78483" Type="2">Beauharnois—Salaberry</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767666">I want to go back to Goodyear again to illustrate some of the consequences of closing a plant of that size in a community. Goodyear Valleyfield had a payroll of $85 million in the Salaberry-de-Valleyfield area. When the Goodyear plant closed, 1,000 jobs were lost, but that figure does not include the maintenance subcontractors, the construction contractors, the restaurant and a number of support businesses that had contracts with Goodyear. For example, C.A.T., a transport company, lost a lucrative contract that was important to its bottom line.</ParaText><ParaText id="767667">When a large plant like this one closes its doors, the consequences are felt not only by the workers, but by an entire region. I can assure my colleagues that the consequences are being felt even though elected representatives and economic development stakeholders are working very hard with the unions and the people who are trying to revive the plant. Reviving a plant like Goodyear or like Les Abattoirs Z. Billette takes a great deal of energy and concentration. I am extremely proud of my region, and I would like to congratulate the mayor of Huntingdon, Stéphane Gendron, and the mayor of Valleyfield, Denis Lapointe, who are leading the way and mobilizing all the stakeholders to find a solution and be innovative and creative.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767668">When everyone is rolling up their sleeves to deal with this crisis, people have a right to expect that the federal government—which has a huge surplus—will support these companies better. Maybe these crises could have been avoided if the government had taken a proactive approach to the crisis in the manufacturing sector.</ParaText><ParaText id="767669">As I travel around my riding, everyone is talking about the crisis in the manufacturing sector. Everyone is sensing the urgency and telling me how important it is to take real action to try to stem the flood of job losses and find solutions to the crisis in manufacturing. All the parties in the House of Commons are in agreement and are urging the federal government to take tangible measures, like the National Assembly in Quebec, the businesspeople, the companies, the unions and the Government of Ontario.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="50">(1550)</Timestamp><ParaText id="767670">In short, I believe that the message cannot be clearer for the Conservative government: in Quebec and in Ontario, among other provinces, the crisis in the manufacturing sector is hitting really hard and is causing economic devastation, but also great human devastation. What we are feeling, what we are hearing from the Conservative government is that all is well in Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="767671">Of course, when one lives in the western part of Canada, one can say that all is well, but this in fact is hiding a reality. When one knows that the economic boom in the west is hiding the reality of what is happening elsewhere, in Quebec for instance, one has to wonder whether the Conservative government is not totally blinded by the economic boom in the west, to the point of forgetting what is going wrong in other parts of the country, including in Quebec. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767672">Perhaps I should remind the House that 135,000 jobs have been lost in Quebec since 2003, including 65,000 since the Conservatives came into office. To refresh the memory of members opposite, Quebec accounts for half the 275,000 jobs that were lost in Canada. We can say that job losses have a major impact in Quebec. We agree that action is needed. The only people who do not believe that it is urgent to act, who are not taking concrete action, are the people opposite, those who hold the power, who can make decisions and really prove that they care about the manufacturing sector and workers who are losing their jobs. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767673">It is said that the economic boom triggered by the oil industry in western Canada is making the Canadian dollar go up in value. We know that the fluctuations of the Canadian dollar primarily affect the manufacturing sector. I have here an article published in the newspaper <I>Les Affaires</I>. It is entitled “Loonie and Oil Go Hand in Hand”. I will quote this article, which explains how the increase in value of the Canadian dollar is related to the higher cost of the barrel of oil. The article says:</ParaText><ParaText id="767674"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The spectacular increase in oil prices allows for profitable oil sands development in western Canada. According to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, production could quadruple between now and the year 2015. Therefore, the dollar should continue to soar, as long as the price of oil keeps increasing.</QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText><ParaText id="767675">More than ever, the value of the loonie is influenced by the price of oil. It is totally unimaginable that the Conservative government would ignore this reality. </ParaText><ParaText id="767676">Here is a familiar metaphor. If there are 20 jobless people in a room and Bill Gates walks in, the average income of all these people immediately goes up. Similarly, when Bill Gates leaves the room, it is just as easy to imagine that everyone remains unemployed. This sorts of reflects the current situation in Canada, in that the economic boom in western Canada masks the stark reality facing Quebec's businesses, manufacturing sector and workers.</ParaText>

						</PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="767691">Mr. Speaker, I wanted to take part in this debate today and to congratulate my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78399" Type="2">Trois-Rivières</Affiliation> on having raised this important matter: the crisis in the manufacturing and forestry sectors. I must also thank my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78483" Type="2">Beauharnois—Salaberry</Affiliation> for agreeing to share her speaking time with me. </ParaText><ParaText id="767692">In her riding, as in many others in Quebec of course,—and one might include Ontario and the Maritimes as well—many MPs are involved daily with the crisis in the manufacturing and forestry sectors. This is, therefore, an important issue for our regions. Thinking of the manufacturing sector alone, this represents 536,000 jobs. It is no trifling matter.</ParaText><ParaText id="767693">The situation is a paradox, given today's context. The present vitality of the Canadian dollar bears witness to Canada's overall economic health. Looked at through a distorting lens or rose coloured glasses, as is the Conservative government's wont, the Canadian economy is seen to be doing well. That is what we are constantly being told by the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> during question period, when we raise the difficulties certain sectors are experiencing.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767694">In fact, his response that everything is doing well is because of the Alberta oil boom. That is all very fine for them, anyway, and far be it from us to say that the people of Alberta are not entitled to a healthy economy. On the contrary, we are very happy for them. Other sectors, however, are experiencing hard times. Unfortunately for other sectors, the oil boom has the effect of strengthening the Canadian dollar, thereby creating the difficulties we are discussing. The vitality of the dollar is therefore linked to the oil boom in Alberta. It has gone up some 60% in relation to the American dollar in four years, thus depriving businesses of their competitive edge in foreign markets.</ParaText><ParaText id="767695">They either lose sales, or they see less profits, or they lay people off. Unfortunately, in many instances, businesses do all three because the hurdles are too great and they are trying to survive. Restructuring then takes place and the restructuring plans include the elements I have referred to. So the bottom line is that jobs are lost. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767696">It is also catastrophic to realize that, for every cent that the Canadian dollar goes up in relation to the American dollar, at least 19,000 manufacturing jobs are threatened. As we know, the dollar has shot up in recent weeks, and every time that it went up 1¢, 19,000 jobs were in jeopardy.</ParaText><ParaText id="767697">The strengthening Canadian dollar has also meant more manufacturing business failures in the first six months of 2007 than in all of 2004. We are now in a situation where those rose coloured glasses I referred to a few minutes ago really must be set aside. The government must not only wake up to the situation but also start taking action, particularly given its much vaunted and huge surplus. This surplus is a complete reality and all manner of measures have been put in place to please this sector and that, while oddly enough totally forgetting those sectors that have been hit the most from the economic point of view: manufacturing and forestry. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767698"> The Quebec manufacturing sector as a whole did not make a profit in 2006. We have to exclude the pharmaceutical industry, but for the rest everything was bad. At least, if we did manage to get anywhere, we just made it, without making a profit. Quebec exports have fallen steadily over the last three years. If these statistics cannot wake the government up, I do not know what will.</ParaText><ParaText id="767699"> We are talking about a loss of 135,000 manufacturing jobs since 2002, including 65,000 since the Conservative government came to power. This too should have told these people something. They pride themselves on being in power, on being able to do anything, on being the only ones in a position to take action. And yet, since the Conservatives have been in power, 65,000 jobs have disappeared in the manufacturing sector. Might there be someone, somewhere in this government, who will decide to roll up his sleeves and do something to ease these problems? </ParaText><ParaText id="767700"> I want to talk about the clothing industry because, in my constituency of <Affiliation DbId="78421" Type="2">Richmond—Arthabaska</Affiliation> there are many clothing, textile and furniture businesses. These are businesses that have suffered huge losses for many years. It is a glaring problem.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp><ParaText id="767701"> In the clothing industry, for example, there were 30,000 jobs in 2006. In 1988 there were 90,000. The decline has been steady since 1988. </ParaText><ParaText id="767702"> In textiles, there were 17,500 jobs in Quebec last year. There were 36,000 in 1988.</ParaText><ParaText id="767703"> In the furniture industry, there has been a 22% reduction in the workforce. </ParaText><ParaText id="767704"> There are also the paper mills and sawmills. Again, in my riding there are Domtar and Cascades, for example. These are job-creating companies that are pulling out all the stops to preserve these jobs. And I must point out that these are quality jobs. They say that the economy is doing well. They are proud of the unemployment rate. I have heard a number of members here today telling us to pay attention: the unemployment rate may be about the same, but what kinds of jobs are these now? High-tech jobs and jobs with excellent conditions and salaries are being replaced by much more precarious jobs, part-time jobs, less well-paying jobs. This is not included in the unemployment statistics and percentages. So this is a reality which we also have to face up to. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767705"> As I was saying, for the paper mills and sawmills, we are talking about a reduction of 10,000 jobs between 2002 and 2005. And since April 2005, if we add the jobs lost in the forestry industry, 21,000 more jobs have been lost. </ParaText><ParaText id="767706"> The rising dollar, combined with Chinese competition in these sectors, has resulted in our traditional sectors being even harder hit. Here again, the Conservative government has not taken the necessary action to mitigate the consequences of this competition. I mention China, but there are many other countries that are exporting more and more to Canada and Quebec. China is the most significant: between 2001 and 2006, Chinese clothing and textile imports have increased by a factor of eight, furniture imports by six, and bicycle imports by five. There are certain measures under World Trade Organization rules that can be taken, but which Canada is refusing to take. Whether the government is Liberal or Conservative, the end result is the same.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767707"> Let us look now at some examples of that damage in a riding such as my own. There are many factory closings in the clothing industry—I spoke about them earlier—and in the textile industry. In the furniture industry, Shermag, which operated for years in Victoriaville, has closed its doors. Shermag is doing more and more business with China. Shermag products and furniture, unfortunately, are now made in China. This is happening not only in our area. In the Eastern Townships generally, where Shermag was located, regrettably, many factories have been closed. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767708"> In the lumber sector, Placages St-Raymond, Flexart division, has just closed its plant in Victoriaville in my riding. There were about 30 jobs left. In the paper sector, I just visited Domtar in Windsor, where they began a restructuring plan in 2005. They were forced to reduce the workforce. At one time, Domtar employed more than 1,100 people in Windsor; now there are just under 900. There has been attrition, and retirements to try to minimize the damage. In short, they used all available resources so that people would not be too badly affected. Once again, these were excellent jobs with excellent salaries. I do not have to tell you what a disaster it would be if ever we lost those jobs in our region. </ParaText><ParaText id="767709"> There was also Cascades at Kingsey Falls. This company has been highly praised all around the world. Just recently, Cascade said it might be forced to increase its investments in the United States in order to move its production base to where it sells its products, which is the United States. So, this is a serious concern for the people in my riding.</ParaText><ParaText id="767710"> In closing, I do not want to forget to mention some important quotations: </ParaText><ParaText id="767711"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The Conservative laissez-faire policy is not a solution.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>

Lawrence Cannon (Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="767732">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be sharing my time with my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78465" Type="2">Lotbinière—Chutes-de-la-Chaudière</Affiliation>, and I would be happy to respond to the motion by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78399" Type="2">Trois-Rivières</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="767733">To start, I would like to state that the government shares the concerns about workers adversely affected by current changes currently sweeping through certain sectors of our economy. We share the concerns of our colleagues opposite, but our situation is quite different. The Bloc is in a position to point out problems; as the government, we are in a position to solve them and that is what we are doing. </ParaText><ParaText id="767734">Although the economy and employment in Canada are experiencing vigorous growth, it is clear that certain sectors, the forestry sector in particular, are under a great deal of pressure.</ParaText><ParaText id="767735">Last year, 422,000 jobs were created in Canada, with 89,000 in Quebec. However, for various reasons, this is not the trend in the forestry sector. External factors, especially the rapid appreciation of the Canadian dollar on international money markets, rising energy costs, pest infestations and increased overseas competition, have greatly harmed this sector.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767736">Workers in this sector are directly affected by these changes. The Government of Canada is aware of the difficulties faced by workers in the Quebec forestry sector and, of course, throughout Canada, and wants to help these individuals adapt to the upheaval. The throne speech expresses our commitment in this regard.</ParaText><ParaText id="767737">The government has undertaken to defend the interests of traditional industries in crisis. We have taken concrete measures to follow through on this commitment. For example, the 2006 budget set aside $400 million for the forestry industry to help it deal with difficult situations. We are particularly aware of the plight of workers who have lost their jobs in this sector.</ParaText><ParaText id="767738">Our contribution to labour adjustment includes, among other things, assistance enabling laid-off workers to acquire skills and find jobs in other sectors, particularly in construction and mining, where there is strong demand in various regions throughout the country and in Quebec. </ParaText><ParaText id="767739">We are also investing significant resources in order to provide support to laid-off workers, through the employment insurance program, parts 1 and 2, and the targeted initiative for older workers, which was recently put in place.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767740">In all, $350 million will be paid out in regular benefits to Canadian workers who have lost jobs in the forest industry. Close to $60 million go to older workers who have lost their jobs in this particular sector. </ParaText><ParaText id="767741">The government is also making sure that unemployed workers are being treated fairly as far as income support is concerned. We do, however, also wish to ensure that these people have the opportunity to receive support and assistance in order to remain in the workforce when they lose their jobs. This is particularly the case for older workers who lose their jobs. The knowledge and experience they have accumulated over the years are immeasurable assets. </ParaText><ParaText id="767742">Despite all they have to offer, older workers run into particular obstacles when they try to find a new job. Some lack the training required to adapt to today's workforce; some have skills that are not a good fit with the new jobs available; employers may be reluctant to hire people who are nearing retirement age. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767743">For these reasons, we have created the targeted initiative for older workers. The federal government has announced a contribution of $70 million, through this initiative, to support the cost-shared programs put in place in conjunction with the provinces and territories in order to help older workers hard hit by this reality to adapt to the new requirements of the job market. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp><ParaText id="767744">To date, as part of the targeted initiative for older workers, the Government of Canada has signed agreements with nine provinces and territories. Moreover, the funds have now been disbursed in support of new projects. Some 40 cost-shared projects have been approved so far, 20 of those in Quebec.</ParaText><ParaText id="767745">Out of the current $8.9 million envelope available to Quebec under the targeted initiative for older workers, the equivalent of $7.1 million has been earmarked for the forestry and forest products sectors. In all, approximately 1,400 older unemployed workers are receiving an income supplement through this initiative. They are also entitled to training and other forms of assistance in order to remain productive. We have also struck a group of experts on older workers with a view to assessing what measures the older laid-off worker requires, focusing particularly on improvements to training and income support. </ParaText><ParaText id="767746">It is evident, therefore, that the government is already providing the unemployed with the type of support the opposition motion addresses. I would stress that we will continue to work in conjunction with our counterparts in the provinces and territories within the targeted initiative for older workers with a view to ensuring the creation of other projects in sectors that are experiencing these difficulties. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767747">We are also contributing to other activities that help workers adjust to changing economic circumstances and new market conditions. The Sector Council Program of Canada is a good example of that. Last month in Jonquière, Quebec, my colleague, the <Affiliation DbId="78744" Type="4">Minister of Labour</Affiliation>, announced an investment of over $250,000 to help set up a forestry sector council. As is the case for the other sector councils, this project brings together leaders within the sector to address their human resources issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="767748">The <Affiliation DbId="105827" Type="4">Minister of Human Resources and Social Development</Affiliation> has spoken with members of the mining industry's sector council. The mining industry is growing and is in great need of skilled workers. This council sector recently launched a new project to communicate with the declining sectors, in order to assess the interest the mining industry might generate among workers whose employment is uncertain.</ParaText><ParaText id="767749">The forestry industry is a good example of a sector where workers might have transferable skills. Our government is well aware of the problems facing workers affected by the changes happening in the global economy. We are working on resolving these problems in a tangible way. </ParaText>

As a result, $1 billion dollars has found its way into the pockets of companies in Quebec. Despite this, recent months have been difficult for the Canadian forestry sector. The Government of Canada is acutely aware of that.</ParaText><ParaText id="767771"> In October 2006, the Government of Canada provided $72.5 million to fund a shared-cost program for older workers who have lost their jobs and who live in vulnerable communities. We announced a series of measures designed to support the competitiveness of Canadian companies and vitality of the regions, especially those dealing with very difficult situations due to the importance of the forest sector to their economies.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767772"> In February 2007, the Government of Canada allocated $127.5 million to ensure the competitiveness of the Canadian forestry industry through three initiatives of Natural Resources Canada: $70 million was allocated for promoting innovation and investments in forestry; $40 million was invested in market development; and $12.5 million was provided for development of a national strategy to address forest pests. In addition to these three measures, a forestry sector council has been established with a mandate to focus on issues relating to the forestry workforce. Human Resources and Social Development has invested $5 million in this project.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767773"> In July 2007, we announced the introduction of the forest communities program of Natural Resources Canada, which will help forestry communities to develop the tools, techniques and strategies they need to meet the challenges facing the Canadian forestry sector. This program takes into account Canada’s obligations under international agreements that we have signed, including agreements with the World Trade Organization and the softwood lumber agreement. </ParaText><ParaText id="767774"> Economic Development Canada is also contributing to diversification of forest communities by means of the Community Economic Diversification Initiative—Vitality. This program, with a budget of $85 million, will operate until September 2010. It is designed to support economic diversification of regions that are particularly affected by current difficulties in the forestry and manufacturing sectors. CEDI-Vitality covers seven regions, including several resource regions, such as Abitibi-Témiscamingue, the North Shore, northern Quebec, Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine and 21 other regional municipalities grappling with specific economic problems.</ParaText><ParaText id="767775"> Despite the energetic action of the Government of Canada, rationalization of the forestry industry continues and other losses of jobs are predictable. The difficulties of the forestry sector, just like those of the manufacturing sector, are not solely the result of a weak business climate, but they rather indicate that these sectors are going through a structural transition period affecting the whole world.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767776"> It was in this context that the government announced in the Speech from the Throne its firm intention to continue defending key sectors of our economy, such as forestry and the manufacturing industry. I remind you that the Bloc Québécois voted against this acknowledgement of the difficulties in these industries.</ParaText><ParaText id="767777"> Furthermore, when our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">prime minister</Affiliation> commits himself to something, unlike the leader of the Bloc Québécois, he keeps his promises. The role of the government is to create an environment conducive to innovation, investment and productivity, because this is the way to maintain a business climate that will protect jobs and companies in this country. This is the spirit in which the <Affiliation DbId="78745" Type="4">Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec</Affiliation> launched new economic measures for the regions of Quebec, and in which our government developed Advantage Canada, a strategic plan designed to improve the prosperity of our country, which necessarily depends on that of our regions.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp><ParaText id="767778"> Regarding taxes, the 2007 Economic Statement proposed an enhanced capital cost allowance rate of 50% for eligible machinery and equipment acquired since March 19, 2007, and before 2009. We have also proposed increasing the capital cost allowance for buildings used for the manufacture and processing of computer equipment and natural gas distribution lines and liquefied gas facilities. </ParaText><ParaText id="767779"> Recently, in the latest economic statement by the Minister of Finance, we announced a major reduction in Canadians’ tax burden. Since our election, Canadians’ income taxes have been reduced by $190 billion, and the GST has dropped from 7% to 5%. Although the leader of the Bloc Québécois voted for the abolition of the GST in 1996, now he is against these measures that are putting taxpayers’ money back into their pockets. These measures, which are designed to improve the investment climate, were welcomed by Canadian exporters and manufacturers, and by many organizations active in various industrial sectors. We are thus meeting one of the main priorities of the manufacturing sector by taking action in the corporate tax environment. Once again, the Bloc Québécois voted against it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767780"> Behind all these questions there is a whiff of panic in the Bloc Québécois. It has conflict trouble. Since the Conservative government was elected, the Bloc has been panicking. It does not know which way to turn, a bit like its leader who took a flying leap into provincial politics for 24 hours a couple months ago. </ParaText><ParaText id="767781"> However, I would like to congratulate my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78561" Type="2">Saint-Lambert</Affiliation>: it is a wise decision that shows he understands how powerless the Bloc is and that he will never be able to do anything for his riding. </ParaText><ParaText id="767782"> The Bloc is panicking because we are delivering concrete results for Quebec, something that the Bloc members could never do. Since we were elected, we have practised open federalism in Ottawa, to the great benefit of Quebec. We recognized the Québécois as a nation and gave Quebec the seat it deserves at UNESCO. We solved the fiscal imbalance, settled the softwood lumber dispute, provided $350 million for the Government of Quebec’s green plan, and much more besides. The unemployment rate has never been so low, just like taxes, which have not been so low in 50 years. It is typical to see the Bloc shouting itself hoarse, as it is doing over the forestry crisis. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767783"> I have a question to ask of the Bloc members: where were they in 1993 when the crisis erupted in the forest industry? They were never heard denouncing the Péquiste government of the time for trying to wipe out Quebec forestry. Why their sudden interest now in the working people and families of Quebec? </ParaText><ParaText id="767784"> What results has the Bloc Québécois achieved? It has immobilized Quebec for more than a decade. There was no fiscal imbalance before the Bloc arrived in Ottawa. It was only with a powerless Bloc Québécois facing the old Liberal government that the fiscal imbalance materialized. The Bloc did nothing when a crisis erupted in the forest industry because it did not want to embarrass the Péquistes. It did nothing about the softwood lumber dispute. It did not prevent the Liberals from stealing from taxpayers in the sponsorship scandal, and did nothing to stop the Liberals’ laissez-faire approach to the environment. All that the Bloc does is ask questions, and it sure does that. But in their rush to ask questions, the Bloc members forgot to do their work. That is why Quebeckers now want to unblock their future. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

If they did, they would realize that they are being well served by members of the Bloc Québécois, who are smart enough to see past the narrow partisan interests that, as we have just seen, are the Conservatives' stock in trade. That was made very clear just now.</ParaText><ParaText id="767794">The truth is that things are not going well in Quebec's manufacturing sector or in Ontario's. Instead of pretending this is not happening—my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78421" Type="2">Richmond—Arthabaska</Affiliation> suggested that the Conservatives take off their rose-coloured glasses—they should take a good look at the numbers, which do not lie. The manufacturing sector lost over 100,000 jobs between 2002 and 2006, many of them—65,000—since the Conservatives came to power in 2006. Even though jobs have been created in the manufacturing sector, jobs have also been lost. Job losses have been increasing over the past few months because of the combined effects of the surging Canadian dollar and rising energy prices.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767795">Jobs have been created in sectors that depend on the wealth created by the manufacturing sector. This can all be found in the government's economic statement. I do not understand why the Conservatives refuse to read their own document. Page 30 clearly shows that all manufacturing sectors, except oil and coal, have seen a decrease in their real gross domestic product since 2005, including the following industries: machinery, paper, plastic, food and beverage, primary metals, textile, clothing, leather, wood, furniture and automobile. All those sectors have experienced negative growth since 2005. The Conservatives really are turning a blind eye on this reality by refusing to acknowledge the figures they give in their own document.</ParaText><ParaText id="767796">I forget to mention that I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78662" Type="2">Berthier—Maskinongé</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="767797">Even the Conservatives admit, in their document, that there is a crisis in the manufacturing sector. They are hiding—just as the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> hid during question period today—behind the fact that we have seen a net increase in job creation. Yes, we saw a net increase in job creation, but in what sectors? This information can be found in that same government document. I doubt the Conservatives will dispute the value of the their own document and the information therein. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767798">Basically, jobs have been created in the public sector, construction and retail. However, those sectors cannot function on their own. When someone has a house built, they can do so because they have an income to pay for the house. Those who do not have a job cannot afford to buy a house. Furthermore, one of the current effects of the manufacturing crisis is a decrease in the number of construction projects in Quebec.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767799"> Insofar as commerce is concerned, if there are no consumers because people are not working, business will necessarily tail off. In my riding, or more specifically in Saint-Michel-des-Saints, two factories closed at the same time in August 2006. These were Louisiana Pacific factories. Management in the U.S. decided to close them. Two hundred and fifty good jobs were lost. People are trying to find someone to take over these factories, but it will be hard under a Conservative government that has not announced any measures to come to the assistance of the manufacturing sector. </ParaText><ParaText id="767800"> When these 250 people lost their jobs, it was their livelihoods that they lost. They do not even get employment insurance any more. Some of them get social assistance. It is obvious and all the merchants in Saint-Michel-des-Saints will say that they have suffered steep declines in sales. Retailers cannot survive on their own. </ParaText><ParaText id="767801"> The Conservatives have this magic thinking and are not concerned about manufacturing. This was true of the former industry minister in particular, who is now the <Affiliation DbId="111553" Type="4">foreign affairs minister</Affiliation>. He obviously has not improved very much in view of the answer he gave today to a very important question about tortured Afghan prisoners. He gave a lackadaisical answer, a bit like the other member did a little while ago with his stupid attacks on the Bloc Québécois. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767802"> It is the same thing in the public sector. If jobs are to be created here, we need people first who have jobs and can pay taxes so that people can be hired. In places where there is some economic growth and increased employment, it is all in sectors that depend on other sectors, especially manufacturing. That is without counting all the services that depend on the manufacturing sector and are affected, the so-called corporate services such as engineering and consulting firms. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp><ParaText id="767803"> Closing our eyes to reality, as the Conservatives do, will just take us closer toward a catastrophe, which is already looking very serious. There is a slowdown in the United States—things are not going well—but they prefer just to close their eyes. As a Créditiste said some years ago, the Liberals led us to the edge of the precipice, the Conservatives will have us take one more step, and we will fall in for sure. <ForceColumnBreak/></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767804">It is therefore important to recognize that reality and, as my hon. colleague said, if the people in the Conservative government took off their rose-coloured glasses, if they could shed that ideological bias which is more than conservative and is indeed ultra-conservative, they would see that measures are necessary and that state intervention is required. This is especially important since the bulk of our exports, to the U.S. in particular, are in the manufacturing sector. It represents between 80% and 85% of our exports. That is why, with the decline of the manufacturing sector, Quebec, which had a positive balance of trade in 2000, 2001 and 2002, has been having negative ones since 2003. In 2003, the value of our imports exceeded that of our exports by $2.2 billion. By 2004, the balance had dropped to minus $4.9 billion, and in 2005 and 2006, it was approximately minus $8.4 billion. Do not come and tell us that all is well; it is not. Because of the Conservatives' lack of action, Quebec is getting poorer.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767805">We can clearly understand why the Conservative government is not particularly interested in helping the manufacturing sector. Its economic development strategy is entirely built on Alberta tar sands and on oil and gas development. Anytime this government announces new measures, they benefit the big oil companies first. The tax cut announced in the economic statement will essentially benefit those who make profits and, as I demonstrated, on average the manufacturing industry—not every company, but the industry on average—is running deficits and, being in the red, does not pay tax. Naturally, one industry stands out: the oil industry. The measure announced by the Conservative government will allow the country's five biggest oil companies to save, within five years, half a billion dollars a year in taxes. They will benefit from that measure, while all the other companies which are in difficulty will not.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767806"> We are making an appeal, and the motion brought forward by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78399" Type="2">Trois-Rivières</Affiliation> is very clear. There are solutions, but people must open their eyes, end their magical thinking, and forget about laissez-faire. That is not the case; as I have just said: they have a strategy essentially based on hydrocarbons and petroleum. This is harmful to Quebec and also part of Ontario. This strategy is causing extreme harm to the manufacturing sector, as well as to Quebec and its regions. In Montreal and in Quebec City as well, small and medium-sized businesses are now in trouble and they need a great deal more support. I spoke about “magical thinking” and that is exactly how the former Minister of Industry—now the <Affiliation DbId="111553" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation>—is thinking when, for example, the government buys aircraft from Boeing and it does not require the company to ensure that the benefits for Quebec will be proportional in terms of Quebec's jobs and production in the Canadian aerospace industry—between 50% and 60% depending on the criteria used—saying that Quebec will eventually feel the benefits some day. The problem is that Boeing is located in Seattle; all the sub-contractors are in the Canadian west. Without action by this government to ensure benefits for Quebec, there will be practically none. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767807"> That is what is going on at present. They have caused harm to Quebec with this laissez-faire policy. In her motion, my colleague proposes a series of measures that are absolutely necessary and being called for by manufacturing associations. On the weekend, I listened again to Daniel Charron, the former managing director of the Quebec export manufacturers association, who was calling on the governments to intervene, to come to the aid of the manufacturing sector—in particular, the forestry sector—through support programs, investment and tax measures, but tax measures that help companies that are in trouble, not those who are making profits like the large oil companies, who are assured of being well served with this government, which is not the case for the regions of Quebec and the manufacturing sector. </ParaText><ParaText id="767808"> It is fortunate that the Bloc is here to speak on behalf of the regions, the manufacturing sector, and the workers who make their living there.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I refer to the crises being experienced in all regions of Quebec in the forestry and manufacturing sectors, as well as the precarious situation in which thousands of workers have been thrust as a result.</ParaText><ParaText id="767825">The motion we introduced today calls upon the Conservative government to establish a series of measures to help the manufacturing and forestry sectors hard hit by the rising dollar and increased competition from new emerging countries, which are, as we know, capable of very low-cost mass production.</ParaText><ParaText id="767826">Our motion proposes concrete measures aimed at supporting businesses, such as loans to update production facilities, heavy investments, or tax measures to support innovation, research and development.</ParaText><ParaText id="767827">The Bloc Québécois also calls for a review of the trade laws to better protect our companies against unfair competition, dumping in particular, by bringing Canadian legislation more in line with that of other developed countries. </ParaText><ParaText id="767828">This is, moreover, what the Bloc Québécois is also proposing in its Bill <Document DbId="3073353" Type="3">C-411</Document>, soon to be debated in the House. </ParaText><ParaText id="767829">We are also calling upon the government to provide better financial support to the workers unfortunately affected by this crisis in the manufacturing sector. As a number of my colleagues have already pointed out today, this motion by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78399" Type="2">Trois-Rivières</Affiliation> has become necessary because this government has demonstrated, in its recent throne speech and its economic statement, its indifference to the difficult situation of all the men and women working in the manufacturing and forest industries and also the communities dependent on those industries.</ParaText><ParaText id="767830">In both cases, the Conservatives have demonstrated once again their total disdain for the lot of these thousands of workers who have been so greatly affected. This attitude appears all the more disdainful when we realize that the federal government has huge financial means with which to provide them with assistance. One need only think of the surplus it has amassed. </ParaText><ParaText id="767831">I am, however, not really surprised by the attitude of this government, which is being true to form. Once again, the Conservatives are choosing to do nothing to help the manufacturing and forestry sectors when they are in such crying need of help. </ParaText><ParaText id="767832">One must, however, acknowledge its consistency. When this government does decide to act, it tries to help its beloved petroleum industry based in western Canada, by reducing taxes. These companies, with their already huge profits, will be entitled to another hand up by this Conservative government. </ParaText><ParaText id="767833">However, tax reductions will be of no help to companies in the forestry and manufacturing sector because they are not turning a profit as a result of the crisis they are experiencing, a crisis brought on mainly by the policies of this laissez-faire government.</ParaText><ParaText id="767834">When the ministers responsible for the economic development of Quebec and for transportation babble on about how tax cuts will help these vulnerable sectors, they are demonstrating that they are actually unable to defend the interests of Quebeckers. Only the Bloc Québécois defends the interests of Quebec, as shown by this motion today.</ParaText><ParaText id="767835">Tax cuts benefit those who make profits. That is logical. We do not need lengthy economic studies to understand that when you record a loss, you do not pay taxes. Thus, many of the industries that are in trouble will not benefit from the measures announced by this government.</ParaText><ParaText id="767836">As pointed out today, Baronet, a furniture manufacturer in Sainte-Marie in Beauce—in the riding of one of our Conservative colleagues—announced last Friday that it was permanently shutting down its operations, resulting in the loss of 150 jobs, after attempting to restructure and get back on track for the past two years. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp><ParaText id="767837">A Conservative member was elected in this riding. But to no avail.</ParaText><ParaText id="767838">Did tax cuts help this company? I do not believe so. This company was not turning a profit. I am convinced that the type of assistance we are proposing could have helped this company and its employees. By lowering taxes, the Conservatives have chosen to give their oil friends a generous gift just in time for Christmas. Unfortunately, a great number of Quebec workers will experience hard times this Christmas because of job losses in the forestry and manufacturing sectors. In my riding, and throughout Quebec, people have lost their jobs.</ParaText><ParaText id="767839">It is rather disappointing to note that this government refuses to help these companies in trouble and the workers that depend on them. I would add that it is especially shocking to note that the Conservative members from Quebec are going along with the irresponsible decisions of this government. It is shocking because the lack of action by the Conservatives is jeopardizing important sectors of the Quebec economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="767840">Let us look at the jobs lost in Quebec's manufacturing sector alone. Some 135,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost in Quebec—the equivalent of one worker in five—since December 31, 2002, including 65,000 since the Conservatives came to power. This precious government, which currently does not see any economic problems in Quebec or Canada, achieved these results at the economic level. Quebec accounted roughly for half the 275,000 jobs lost in Canada during that period. Quebeckers will remember. While the manufacturing sector represented 17.4% of the jobs in Quebec in 2004, it represented just 15% of the jobs in July 2007.</ParaText><ParaText id="767841">In my riding of <Affiliation DbId="78662" Type="2">Berthier—Maskinongé</Affiliation>, which I have the honour of representing, there is a very significant manufacturing sector and that is the furniture sector. This industry plays an important role in Quebec's economy and has proven in the past to be able to respond to the new challenges of international competition. Now, in light of the new trade reality, this industry needs government support to help adjust. Let us not forget that this furniture industry saw a 22% cut in its labour force. It currently generates roughly 24,000 jobs compared to 25,000 jobs in 2005, 29,000 in 2002, and 30,500 in 2000. This is quite dramatic. We have to do something about this. The government has to take action to help these companies.</ParaText><ParaText id="767842">I have spoken about this a number of times in this House. In December 2006, I tabled a notice of motion calling on the federal government to implement an aid package to support the furniture industry as it adjusts to the rising Canadian dollar. I also asked for support to help the industry cope with fierce competition from emerging countries, a competition whereby Chinese imports have increased eight-fold, furniture imports six-fold, and bicycle imports five-fold. Unfortunately, the federal government chose not to present any aid package or research support program to help this industry adapt.</ParaText><ParaText id="767843">We all remember when the Canadian International Trade Tribunal declared that the Quebec bicycle industry was on the brink of being wiped out by Chinese imports. It concluded that the only thing that might limit the impact was the establishment of safeguards. The furniture industry even took an initiative in that regard. However, it backed off knowing that, despite favourable recommendations from the Canadian International Trade Tribunal, the government would not apply them.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp><ParaText id="767844">For the future of jobs in these sectors and of the communities that depend on them, I ask all members, especially Conservative members from Quebec, who are sensitive to matters involving Quebec, to support the motion of the member for <Affiliation DbId="78399" Type="2">Trois-Rivières</Affiliation>.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Masse" id="2192036"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78884" Type="2">Mr. Brian Masse (Windsor West, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="767845">Mr. Speaker, over the last decade, the Liberal and Conservative plans for the manufacturing sector have been abysmal. When we look at the record, it was the Liberals, under the member for <Affiliation DbId="78571" Type="2">LaSalle—Émard</Affiliation>, who introduced the notion of having a Korea trade agreement, which right now would cost our auto manufacturing sector. Ironically, the Liberal minister who was supposed to actually develop an auto policy, crossed the floor to the Conservatives and is now driving this home at the expense of our auto workers across the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="767846">Second, there is a connection with the Conservatives policy. The Conservatives have implemented a market policy under Transport Canada that is a feebate system, which is a tax on cars. Interestingly, it was done under the guise of incentivizing eco-efficient vehicles but it has done the exact opposite. The system they put in place is so flawed. Subcompact car sales have not gone down for those feebate vehicles. It is the same with the SUVs and large cars. It has had the exact opposite effect.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767847">What is ironic is that right now auto workers are being laid off in Oshawa, Brantford and other parts of the country where their hard-earned tax-paying dollars are actually going overseas to subsidize those vehicles that are flooding into our market.

Second reading</ProceduralText><ParaText id="767877"> moved that Bill <Document DbId="3073265" Type="4">C-376, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (impaired driving) and to make consequential amendments to other Acts</Document>, be read the second time and referred to a committee. </ParaText><ParaText id="767878"> He said: Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise to address the House of Commons this evening to debate Bill <Document DbId="3073265" Type="4">C-376, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (impaired driving) and to make consequential amendments to other Acts</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="767879">I table this bill on behalf of my constituents of <Affiliation DbId="78517" Type="2">Kelowna—Lake Country</Affiliation> to try to address a problem that concerns them and concerns me as a member of Parliament and, not least, as a father of three daughters, two of them still teenagers and thus part of a demographic that is particularly vulnerable to the tragic results of drinking and driving.</ParaText><ParaText id="767880">On February 6, my colleagues and I had the honour to rise and debate this bill. Here today we do so again, this time with the benefit of discussing the points of debate that were raised previously. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767881">In that first hour of debate, it was clear that all members agree in principle that drinking and driving is dangerous and that too many innocent people have paid too high a price. About 1,350 Canadians die each year in alcohol related motor vehicle crashes. Many thousands more sustain serious injuries. It is estimated that the annual costs associated with health care, damaged property and lost wages resulting from crashes involving alcohol exceed $5 billion.</ParaText><ParaText id="767882"> Other statistics are equally serious.</ParaText><ParaText id="767883"> Drinking and driving is responsible for about 40% of all fatal motor vehicle crashes. More than four million Canadians admit to driving after drinking. About 12.5 million car trips were made by people who thought they had too much to drink but failed to take the right steps to protect themselves.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767884">Clearly we as legislators have a responsibility to find a way to reduce the risks of drinking and driving on Canadian highways. Let us be clear. This is not an easy task. This particular bill does not work for everyone. </ParaText><ParaText id="767885">There is disagreement among the provinces, among members of Parliament and even among police enforcement agencies on how to best achieve our goal of reducing the fatal and injurious incidents caused by drinking and driving, on how to have a consistent law across the country, and on how to best help law enforcement carry out the law.</ParaText><ParaText id="767886"> I am well aware of this and I am willing to work with my colleagues to find the best way to reach the goal. We may disagree with the “how“, but we can all agree that we need to do something.</ParaText><ParaText id="767887">As the bill currently stands, Bill <Document DbId="3073265" Type="4">C-376</Document> will create a new .05 blood alcohol concentration, otherwise known as the BAC allowance. This offence is in addition to the current .08 BAC that already exists in the Criminal Code. </ParaText><ParaText id="767888">Within this legislation that is being proposed, the new .05 limit will be an exclusively summary conviction offence with relatively moderate fines and driving prohibitions, will give peace officers the right to issue a ticket to the accused, who can choose to plead guilty without having to appear in a court, and will make changes to the Criminal Records Act so that if a person convicted of the new .05 offence has no additional drinking- and driving-related convictions for two years, the record of the conviction will be destroyed.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767889">My colleagues have raised concerns that .05% could target the wrong drivers. These concerns are echoed by some in the alcoholic beverage industry. Their concern is that people who enjoy alcohol responsibly, rather than hard-core drinkers, would be targeted by the .05% BAC. These concerns are shared by some of my own constituents. I empathize with them. I understand. We are working together.</ParaText><ParaText id="767890">An example of this is a letter that appeared in the local paper in my riding, the <I>Kelowna Capital News</I>. A constituent wrote that lowering the blood alcohol content to .05% would succeed only in stopping people from going out to dinner and enjoying a drink with a meal and would fail to curb heavy drinkers, who he believed caused the majority of accidents and could not be deterred.</ParaText><ParaText id="767891">In fact, these are common misconceptions. Research supports the fact that a lower blood alcohol content does not impede one from enjoying a drink with dinner or going out with a few friends after work and having a few beverages. In fact, few people understand the amount one can drink and still come under the .08 limit.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767892">At the current level of .08, the average male of 200 pounds can drink six bottles of beer on an empty stomach over a two hour period, get behind the wheel of a car and likely not be charged for impaired driving. That is half a dozen beer. I do not know if a lot of people realize that this is the situation today under .08.</ParaText><ParaText id="767893">In contrast, a blood alcohol content of .05 requires that a person cut those drinks back to four or have a few less glasses of a beverage of choice, which I think we can all agree has no impact on the enjoyment of going out for dinner and enjoying a drink. This has nothing to do with drinking. It has to do with the fact that with drinking and driving there is no safe level. We need to be responsible Canadians. With rights come responsibilities.</ParaText><ParaText id="767894">Second, the assertion that the drunks causing the accidents are the ones who exceed the current .08% is not accurate. As a deterrent effect, a blood alcohol concentration of .05 reduces impaired driving at all BAC levels. In countries such as Germany and Sweden, which have legislated at .05 and .02 respectively, the sharpest declines were seen among those drinkers and drivers at the highest blood alcohol concentration levels.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp><ParaText id="767895">The .05 BAC, then, is not a prohibitionist measure and it is effective in reaching the so-called heavy drinkers. In fact, countries that have instituted a .05 or lower BAC have seen significant reductions in the number of deaths due to impaired driving and have witnessed a deterrent effect on those who drink and drive.</ParaText><ParaText id="767896">When Canadians are informed of these facts and understand the amount of alcohol that the current law allows drivers to consume, surveys show that support increases for a lower blood alcohol concentration limit. </ParaText><ParaText id="767897">Certainly a key component in the debate is education and changing the public's attitude to what is acceptable. In Canada, one organization in particular has a profound impact on educating the public and raising awareness of the harm that is the result of drinking and driving. I am sure it is no stranger to our colleagues in the House and to Canadians in general. The organization is Mothers Against Drunk Driving, otherwise known as MADD Canada. It is a grassroots organization that is the driving force behind the .05 offence and having such a law practised consistently across the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="767898"> At the heart of MADD Canada are the mothers, the fathers and the friends who have suffered great loss because of a drunk driver. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767899">Earlier this year, I met with MADD's national president, Margaret Miller. On May 16, 2004, Margaret's life changed forever. Her son, Bruce, was killed in an impaired driving incident in Caledonia, P.E.I. Bruce was a police constable with the Springhill Police Service. Like so many of MADD's volunteers, within months of Bruce's death, Margaret was speaking in high schools and became a volunteer with MADD.</ParaText><ParaText id="767900">MADD Canada has long supported this cause through the very successful red ribbon campaign. Over four million of these red ribbons have been distributed. I encourage my colleagues in the House to lend their support for the official launch of the 2007 campaign which will take place Thursday, November 15, on Parliament Hill. I wish MADD all the best as it continues in its efforts to fight against impaired driving. In the words of MADD, we have a long way to go to stop impaired driving.</ParaText><ParaText id="767901">Canadians might believe we have some of the toughest laws anywhere, but in fact far fewer drunk drivers are charged here than in the United States. Canada's charge rate of impaired driver arrests is less than half that of the United States. Other countries give their police forces much broader enforcement powers, with the result that they have higher apprehension and detection rates than Canada. In Sweden, for example, 90% of drunk drivers who end up in a hospital are convicted. In Canada, that figure is only 11%.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767902">We have to ask ourselves: is the current .08 blood alcohol concentration in the Criminal Code enough? Does it accurately reflect the true costs associated with drinking and driving? Does it send an adequate message to Canadians that no amount of drinking and driving is safe?</ParaText><ParaText id="767903">When parliamentarians set the .08% BAC in 1970, which is still today's legislation, they did so based on findings that we now know considerably underestimated the risk of fatal crashes associated with impaired driving. Not only does today's research show that a majority of the driving population is impaired in some important measure at as low as a .02% blood alcohol concentration, it has also established that occasional drinkers have a higher risk of fatal crash than regular drinkers at the same blood alcohol concentration.</ParaText><ParaText id="767904">The fact is that no amount of drinking and driving is completely safe, and although logically the only solution is to never drink and drive, as legislators we must balance such laws against the issues of practicality, of the burden it places on the resources of all levels of government and our police, and of the right of the individual to determine his or her choice to act responsibly.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767905">The evidence shows that a blood alcohol concentration level below .05% is a responsible limit. However, it is only part of the solution. Setting lower limits makes sense, but how we enforce lower limits is also critical. If this debate is to achieve anything, it is that it will answer this question: how should we enforce the law effectively?</ParaText><ParaText id="767906">Concerns have been raised about how best to deter drivers from drinking and driving, and these concerns must be addressed, for experience tells us that without agreement on the way forward, we will not succeed in our goals.</ParaText><ParaText id="767907">I am aware that many of the provincial governments are concerned that by adding a .05% BAC to the Criminal Code the measure will unduly burden some of the provinces, the courts and our police. I do not think anyone can argue that it certainly will change what is now the current practice.</ParaText><ParaText id="767908">In closing, at the moment, all provinces with the exception of Quebec have provincial and territorial short term roadside licence suspension legislation. This legislation does not create any offence or carry any fine or other penalty. In most cases, it is a four-hour to twenty-four hour suspension. The car is parked. Someone has to drive the driver home or the driver can take a cab home.</ParaText><ParaText id="767909">Bill <Document DbId="3073265" Type="4">C-376</Document> would add significant weight to the provincial sanctions at .05% blood alcohol concentration.

A study called the STRID report, done by a working group looking at short term suspensions, is a compilation of provincial and territorial organizations and insurance and transportation associations. The Traffic Injury Research Foundation has stated that “drivers with BACs in the 0.051% to the 0.08% range are 7.2 times more likely to be involved in a fatal crash than drivers with 0.00% BACs”. People who are between .051% and 0.08% are 7.2 times more likely to be involved in a fatal crash. Both Canadian and American studies indicate that these relative risks are much higher among young drivers.</ParaText><ParaText id="767916"> I would like to reiterate the fact that impaired driving remains the number one criminal cause of death in Canada.

Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="767919">Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="78517" Type="2">Kelowna—Lake Country</Affiliation> for bringing this matter before the House of Commons.</ParaText><ParaText id="767920">All Canadians and all members of the House are concerned about the damage and the havoc that can be created with drinking and driving irresponsibly. </ParaText><ParaText id="767921">My own view is the bill does not really address the real core issues. It does not address the incidence of the types of accidents caused by chronic drinkers and drivers, those people who drink well in excess of .08. They put their lives and the lives of others in jeopardy by getting behind the wheel of a car. It creates havoc on our roads. These are the people, the repeat offenders, who we should address.</ParaText><ParaText id="767922">We already have some very good sanctions in place at the provincial and territory level. In nine out of ten provinces it is an offence to drive with a blood alcohol content level of .05 or over. The tenth province, the province of Quebec, announced its intention to introduce similar legislation this fall. The law allows for the immediate roadside suspension for anyone caught with a blood alcohol content level over .05. In Saskatchewan is .04.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767923">The benefit of this approach is the sanctions can be handed out by police immediately without all the time and cost of a court proceeding. To criminalize these offences at the .08 or .05 level is unduly harsh. It will clog up our courts and prosecution. We already know about the dangers and the problems we have with Crown prosecutors plea bargaining because our courts are already filled with people who are committing particularly heinous crimes.</ParaText><ParaText id="767924">If it were justified, I would support it. However, in my view it is not supportable, given that the real problem is the chronic drinkers, those who reoffend, those who continuously take their lives and the lives of others in their hands.</ParaText><ParaText id="767925">How many times have we read in the paper about someone who has been charged with drinking and driving and may have been fined extensively. They get back on the road, drink and drive again and are given a slightly harsher penalty. Maybe their driver's licence is suspended. Then they drink and drive again, repeatedly. We need to deal with those people, not the casual drinker. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767926">Every now and then people make a mistake. They might have two or three beers and suddenly find themselves with a criminal charge, which will be with them forever. This may impair their ability to advance in life and become a contributing member of society. I do not think that is warranted in this circumstance. </ParaText><ParaText id="767927">I am not arguing that drinking and driving irresponsibly is not a very serious matter; it is. That is why the provinces, rightly, have imposed pretty serious restrictions and sanctions at the provincial level.</ParaText><ParaText id="767928">I should also add that Bill <Document DbId="3076458" Type="3">C-2</Document>, which is currently before the House, also brings in tougher sanctions for repeat and chronic drinkers who drive. That is the way to deal with it. People who are chronic offenders could be put away for up to 10 years. Those who drink and drive while their licence is suspended should be treated particularly harshly, and Bill <Document DbId="3076458" Type="3">C-2</Document> does that.</ParaText><ParaText id="767929">Bill <Document DbId="3076458" Type="3">C-2</Document> also deals with the question of drug impaired driving. This is a reality we are facing as well. Many people today know police can pull people aside and do a breathalyzer test. They have the technology to detect if someone is over .05 or .08. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="00">(1800)</Timestamp><ParaText id="767930">The reality is the technologies are not there to put in place a regime that recognizes people are taking drugs and driving. In fact, I think we are finding that people of all ages are saying they can beat the rap by having drugs or maybe a mixture of drugs and alcohol. </ParaText><ParaText id="767931">When the police pull them over, it is easy to tell what their alcohol content is through a breathalyzer, but it is very difficult to determine whether someone has ingested drugs. In fact, they might have had prescription drugs for some illness and given the technologies we have today, it is very difficult to determine whether someone has a prescribed drug or even an over the counter drug, or whether it is a mix of that plus marijuana, some cocaine, crack, heroin or whatever.</ParaText><ParaText id="767932">Bill <Document DbId="3076458" Type="3">C-2</Document> attempts, and I think rightly, to put in a regime that deals with drug impaired drivers, but the reality is it is not a simple matter. We should also focus equal attention on drug impaired driving.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767933">Some in this debate have said that by introducing the legislation before us, Bill <Document DbId="3073265" Type="4">C-376</Document>, we would be in line with other jurisdictions. With respect to those who said that, the facts say otherwise. A study was done of international drinking and driving laws in 77 comparable jurisdictions, sponsored by the Canada Safety Council, by an independent, respected organization. It found that only eight jurisdictions treat a .05 driving offence as a crime.</ParaText><ParaText id="767934">The study also has found that in most international jurisdictions a .05 driving is an administrative offence, not a criminal offence. I think the reason for that is for the reasons I outlined. We cannot slap people with criminal records for every crime that is committed otherwise we would be creating a lot havoc within our society.</ParaText><ParaText id="767935">The member who introduced the bill has the right intention and is motivated for the right reasons. However, I would draw him to the fact that the Canada Safety Council does not support the bill. It says that there is insufficient proof that the bill will have a positive impact on the number of serious accidents. This is a very serious negative evaluation of the bill from an organization that is well qualified and should know what would work and what would not.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767936">While I think the intentions of the bill are good, and we are all concerned about this problem, Bill <Document DbId="3073265" Type="4">C-376</Document> takes us in the wrong direction. What we need to focus on is the hard core drinkers, those who continually get in their cars, drink and drive or take drugs and drive. At the provincial level, we have seen a lot of activity with road checks, bringing people over and checking their blood level content. Now with this new regime for drug impaired driving there would be a similar approach.</ParaText><ParaText id="767937">The way I understand that would work, under Bill <Document DbId="3076458" Type="3">C-2</Document>, and I know we studied this at the Standing Committee on Justice, is there would be sort of a three-legged test. First, if people are driving in ways that looks like they are driving dangerously, police officers will pull them aside. They will ask them to do a simple test like walk a straight line. If they cannot do that, they will take a sample on-site of their breath or some other sample from their body and that will be checked by a technician. If that proves to be a problem, the sample will be put through a full laboratory test. If those three tests are there, if the person fails those three tests, they will be then charged with drug impaired driving.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp><ParaText id="767938">That is a positive development in Bill <Document DbId="3076458" Type="3">C-2</Document>. It is the direction we should go. Our party supports that and also the tougher sanctions for chronic repeat offenders, those who drink and drive repeatedly. Those are the people we need to address.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Ménard (Marc-Aurèle-Fortin)" id="2192120"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78405" Type="2">Mr. Serge Ménard (Marc-Aurèle-Fortin, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="767939">Mr. Speaker, indeed I believe that it can be extremely frustrating for a backbencher, in an assembly such as ours, to think about a serious issue and to want to bring a solution to it and help settle it. This is surely how the member for <Affiliation DbId="78517" Type="2">Kelowna—Lake Country</Affiliation> feels while presenting this bill. I know that he has studied the issue extensively before proposing this legislation. I also think that he has a sincere desire to correct a serious issue that needs to be corrected. However, I submit, with all due respect, that he has chosen the wrong means. This is one of the frustrations that we must live with within a federation, all the more so considering that a majority of our fellow citizens, who elected us here, are very often hardly aware of the problems created by the sharing of powers, or sovereignty, between the various levels of government.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767940">I also want to explain to my colleague what we should do if we want to do what most of the countries he mentioned do. They punish impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol content over 0.05%. I would suggest that the best solution would be to do as they have done. They consider it an administrative offence, which enables them to impose an immediate punishment that corresponds to the offence and yields the same results he is proposing in his bill. There is, however, one difference, and it is an important one. Because this is the federal Parliament, not a provincial legislature, he cannot legislate for traffic violations, which fall under provincial jurisdiction. Despite the precautions included in his bill, he can do nothing more than use the Criminal Code to add such offences to the criminal records of those convicted. In contrast, in almost every one of the 77 countries he mentioned that punish such actions, this is an administrative offence.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767941">It is also important to point out that all of the provinces have taken action in this regard. Only one had not taken action until recently, but this weekend, Quebec's Minister of Transportation announced that she would be asking Quebec's National Assembly to make it an offence to drive with a blood alcohol content exceeding 0.05%. That means that everywhere in Canada, in all provinces, on all roads, driving with a blood alcohol content over 0.05% will be considered an offence.</ParaText><ParaText id="767942">Nevertheless, I cannot ignore the statistics quoted by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78509" Type="2">Etobicoke North</Affiliation> the first time he discussed this issue. According to those statistics, only 3% of those injured in accidents had a blood alcohol content over 0.05%. In contrast, 67% had no alcohol in their blood at all. I think that the proportion of those injured who had a much higher blood alcohol content was somewhere between 3% and 67%.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767943">In my opinion, prevention and rehabilitation measures are much more effective than deterrence through scare tactics. Deterrence is necessary, but it is much less effective. In Quebec, we have significantly reduced recidivism rates. If a licence is suspended, it is extremely difficult to get it back. To get it back, the offender must take a course on the dangers of drinking and driving, taught through appropriate films, information on alcohol rates, the number of victims, and so on.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp><ParaText id="767944">Furthermore, offenders must re-take the driving exam to obtain their licence and must pay for all the courses they have to attend. In the end, it is almost like brainwashing. On the other hand, the intention is certainly good: to convince people who have committed this offence and who have been punished not to get their licence back until they have taken these steps.</ParaText><ParaText id="767945">Aware of the fact that he was using the Criminal Code, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78517" Type="2">Kelowna—Lake Country</Affiliation> wanted to reduce the consequences of the use of the Criminal Code for the offender. I appreciate his efforts, but I am not sure he was successful. Nowhere do we see a definition for “criminal record”. The question asked is “Have you ever been charged with or convicted of a criminal offence in Canada?” How is a person with such a conviction supposed to respond? I think that person must answer that they have been convicted of a criminal offence in Canada, even if they have received a pardon.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767946">Furthermore, in this age of computers, how can a record be destroyed? Someone could easily destroy it in Canada and assume that no electronic copies had been made. I have the impression that our neighbours to the south, who collect data on convictions in Canada, would not destroy them. Therefore, it could be harmful. A person convicted of an offence listed in the highway safety codes in various provinces does not have to answer that they have been convicted of a criminal offence. His or her record is not included in the records of criminal convictions.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767947">We share the hon. member's concerns but, the ideal solution, in my opinion, is an administrative one. I also believe that such a solution has the advantage of imposing a penalty in a measured but immediate fashion to the offender. This could mean that he is deprived of his car for a day. I am prepared to recognize that it could be for more than a day. In fact, at one time, in Quebec, we proposed a penalty of up to a month of immediate suspension. This can be done in the case of offences of an administrative nature, but that is not what is provided in the legislation, as it is currently worded.</ParaText><ParaText id="767948">I understand the limits. It is not because I am a sovereignist in Quebec that I am condemning federalism. Federalism may be very appropriate. In any case, I do believe in a true confederation. This is one of the problems that we have here. We come here, we want to change things, we identify a program, but we do not have the means to do it. The means to achieve these laudable objectives, and particularly to truly implement the measures that the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78517" Type="2">Kelowna—Lake Country</Affiliation> wants to implement, is a provincial act. It is with this in mind that the way we are going to vote should be interpreted.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767949">The hon. member felt that I asked him a good question, but I am not sure of the meaning of his reply. I understood that the study to which he referred is a theoretical study. In other words, experts have evaluated that, with a blood alcohol level between 0.03 and 0.08, the attention level of a person is seven times lower, or something to that effect. However, I would be curious to know whether there is a study which shows that, in Canada, people who drive their car and who have a blood alcohol level of 0.04 or 0.05 actually pose a problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="767950">I would like to make one last comment. I will always remember the title of a book. Lise Payette, who, at one time, was a television star in Quebec, and who went on to become the minister who had the National Assembly pass the automobile insurance act, also wrote a book with this very significant title: <I>Le pouvoir?

The first step, however, is to discuss the bill's principles in this House. The next one will be to refer the bill to committee, where it can then be improved. In dealing with matters of public significance, one really has to weigh the pros and cons. The pros are all the measures to stop the epidemic of deaths and injuries caused by individuals who consume alcohol before getting behind the wheel. These are important measures to take. Equally important, although secondary, is the issue of jurisdiction. The main issue is the principle of reducing the number of people killed or injured on our roads.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767955">Clearly, in countries where the legal blood alcohol content was lowered from 0.08% to 0.05%, this decision had a positive impact and fewer people were killed or injured. It is obvious that, as parliamentarians, we have to take measures to remedy the situation by lowering the legal BAC so that there are fewer victims on Canadian roads.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="767956">It is for those reasons that I rise to speak in favour of Bill <Document DbId="3073265" Type="4">C-376</Document> presented by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78517" Type="2">Kelowna—Lake Country</Affiliation>. I am certainly glad that he has done so because this is an important piece of legislation. </ParaText><ParaText id="767957">The NDP in Nova Scotia and in this House traditionally have been in favour of reducing the blood alcohol level that is present in a way that will reduce the number of victims, the number of deaths, and the number of injured on Canada's highways. This is extremely important because all of us as members of Parliament have experience in our particular ridings, in our regions, and our communities with drunk drivers and the victims that they create.</ParaText><ParaText id="767958">In my own riding, I am near to the Patella Bridge, and there have been a number of victims of fatalities and injured individuals as a result of drunk drivers operating on that bridge, particularly in the evenings and in the early morning hours. Taking this kind of measure helps to reduce those number of victims and that is extremely important. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767959">I would like to pay tribute at this time to Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Its headquarters are in New Westminster, on 12th Street, and the lower mainland chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Drivers has done a terrific job of educating the public about victims of drunk drivers. It has spoken about measures that we can all take, educational measures but also legal measures, to reduce the number of victims that we have on Canada's highways.</ParaText><ParaText id="767960">I certainly join with other members of this House in paying tribute to Mothers Against Drunk Drivers. It has made a real difference in our community.</ParaText><ParaText id="767961">Let us go back to the issue of whether or not reducing blood alcohol levels from .08 to .05 actually makes a difference.</ParaText><ParaText id="767962">We know that in this country, we actually have one of the highest percentages of fatally injured drivers who are legally impaired. We have .08 as our standard currently, and recent statistics have shown that over 30% of fatally injured drivers were legally impaired.</ParaText><ParaText id="767963">The United States has similar blood alcohol levels. In fact, in some states it actually ranges higher than .08, and there is a similar percentage of fatally injured drivers who were legally impaired.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767964">However, countries such as Finland, Japan, the Netherlands and Germany that have a lower standard of .05 have actually had much lower rates in regard to the percentage of legally impaired among fatally injured drivers. So in a country such as Finland, with the .05 standard, with a similar cold climate in much of the country, just over 20% of the fatally injured drivers were found to be legally impaired.</ParaText><ParaText id="767965">That is an important benchmark. Lowering that rate essentially seems to make a difference. In countries that have a .05 standard, the percentage of fatally injured drivers who were legally impaired is lower. That is extremely important.</ParaText><ParaText id="767966">Let us look at countries that have taken the action of lowering their blood alcohol level limits. For example, in Belgium there was a 10% decrease in traffic fatalities in 1995, and then a further 11% decrease in 1996 when it reduced the blood alcohol concentration limit to .05, so over a two year span there was an immediate reduction in the number of traffic fatalities.</ParaText><ParaText id="767967">Sweden enacted a .05 blood alcohol concentration limit in the 1950s and it saw a reduction later on, which further reduced that level down to .02. It found that there was a 9.7% reduction in fatal crashes, an 11% reduction in single vehicle crashes, and a 7.5% reduction in all crashes as it lowered the blood alcohol concentration.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767968">In Australia, a 1997 study that analyzed traffic data for periods ranging from 13 to 17 years indicated that those states in Australia that reduced their blood alcohol concentration limits from .08 to .05 experienced positive results right across. Queensland reduced its blood alcohol concentration limit to .05 and there was a 14% reduction in serious collisions, and an 18% reduction in fatal collisions. New South Wales is estimated to have reduced serious collisions by 7%, fatal collisions by 8%, and single vehicle nighttime collisions by 11%. In South Australia there were similar positive results.</ParaText>

It is a no-brainer. It just makes common sense. If we have seen in country after country, in local jurisdiction after local jurisdiction that lowering the blood alcohol concentration limit has saved lives, has reduced the number of crashes, has reduced the number of injuries, why would we not support the bill?

I would like to praise my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78517" Type="2">Kelowna—Lake Country</Affiliation>, for creating a dialogue on this very important subject and for putting this private member's bill forward.</ParaText><ParaText id="767973">As a volunteer and a past board member of Barrie's local chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, I am pleased to address this piece of legislation that will create a new .05% blood alcohol concentration, or BAC, offence. It is in addition to the current .08% BAC which already exists in the Criminal Code. </ParaText><ParaText id="767974">The new .05% will be an exclusively summary conviction offence with relatively moderate fines and driving prohibitions. It will give peace officers the right to issue a ticket to the accused who can choose to plead guilty without having to appear in court. It will make changes to the Criminal Records Act so that if a person convicted of the new over .05% offence has no additional drinking and driving related convictions for two years, the record of the conviction will be destroyed. Certainly these are reasonable proposals.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767975">Introducing .05% into the Criminal Code would save lives. What many people do not know is that impaired driving remains the number one cause of criminal death in Canada, more than all other causes of homicide combined. In part this is because the current .08% BAC is not an accurate reflection of the true risks associated with drinking and driving.</ParaText><ParaText id="767976">Who is most at risk? Youth are particularly at risk. The risk of a fatal crash for males between the ages of 16 and 20 is five times more likely at BAC levels of .02% to .049%. At the current .08% to .99% the risk increases to 52%.</ParaText><ParaText id="767977">When parliamentarians set the .08% BAC level in 1970, they did so based on findings that we now know considerably underestimated the risks of fatal crashes associated with impaired driving. What we know today is driving related skills are significantly impaired at levels well below .08%.</ParaText><ParaText id="767978">Not only does the research show that a majority of the driving population is impaired in some important measures at BACs as low as .02%, it also has established that occasional drinkers have a higher risk of fatal crash than regular drinkers at the same BAC level. </ParaText><ParaText id="767979">The British Medical Association has maintained for decades that a .05% BAC is the highest level that can be accepted as entirely consistent with the safety of other road users.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767980">Virtually all leading medical, accident prevention and traffic safety organizations around the world, including the Canadian Medical Association and the World Health Organization, support a BAC driving limit at or below .05%. As a result, many countries, including Germany, France, Australia and Sweden, have set their BAC limit at .05% or lower .</ParaText><ParaText id="767981">The fact is no amount of drinking and driving is completely safe. And although logically the only solution is to never drink and drive, as legislators we must balance such laws against issues of practicality, of the burden it places on the resources of all levels of government and our police, and the right of the individual to determine his or her own choice to act responsibly.</ParaText><ParaText id="767982">The .05% BAC will save lives. That is the reason so many public health groups, leading medical organizations across Canada and many victims groups are strong supporters of such a measure.</ParaText><ParaText id="767983"> Studies on the potential impact of introducing a .05% Criminal Code offence in Canada conclude that it will have significant traffic safety benefits. Most important, the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in a 1998 study estimated that a .05% BAC would reduce total traffic fatalities by 6% to 18%, a staggering statistic, thereby saving approximately 188 to 551 lives per year in Canada based on the 1998 statistics.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767984">Will .05% adversely affect social drinking? No. An average 200 pound man could drink more than four bottles of beer in two hours on an empty stomach without reaching the real-world threshold for charges under the .05% law. An average 120 pound woman could drink two five ounce glasses of wine in two hours. The assertion that the individuals causing accidents are the ones that exceed the current .08% is not accurate either.</ParaText><ParaText id="767985">As a deterrent effect, lowering the BAC limit reduces impaired driving at all levels. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="30">(1830)</Timestamp><ParaText id="767986">In countries such as Germany and Sweden where levels have been legislated at .05% and .02% respectively, the sharpest declines were seen among those drinkers and drivers at the highest BAC levels. </ParaText><ParaText id="767987">In fact, countries that have instituted a .05% or lower BAC level have seen significant reductions in the number of deaths due to impaired driving and have witnessed a deterrent effect on all those who drink and drive. Therefore, .05% is neither a prohibitionist measure nor is it ineffective in reaching the so-called heavy drinkers.</ParaText><ParaText id="767988">The current .08% BAC limit is simply not having a sufficient deterrent impact. Millions of Canadians continue to drive while impaired with predictably tragic results.</ParaText><ParaText id="767989">The current Criminal Code blood alcohol concentration limit of .08% allows individuals to drive after consuming a large quantity of alcohol. Given the margin of error accepted by our courts, most police will not lay criminal charges unless a driver's evidentiary BAC readings are .10% or higher.</ParaText><ParaText id="767990">When Canadians are informed of these facts and understand the amount of alcohol the current law allows drivers to consume, surveys show that support for a lower BAC limit increases. I believe there is a willingness on the part of Canadians to follow the lead of other countries and set a .05% limit.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="767991">The proposed .05% BAC offence is designed to deter impaired driving without being unduly punitive or creating unacceptable burdens on the police and the courts. The option of pleading guilty without having to go to court and the fact that a person can have a charge erased with two years of clean driving may discourage accused drivers from needlessly challenging the charges and consuming court time.</ParaText><ParaText id="767992">Bill <Document DbId="3073265" Type="4">C-376</Document> will add significant weight to the provincial sanctions at .05%.</ParaText><ParaText id="767993">In all jurisdictions, with the exception of Quebec, there is provincial and territorial short term roadside licence suspension legislation. This legislation does not create any offence or carry any fine or other penalty. In most cases the roadside suspensions are not officially recorded and have no long term licensing consequences. For most drivers the suspension will merely result in having to park the vehicle or allow a sober licensed passenger to drive.</ParaText><ParaText id="767994">Those who violate the proposed Criminal Code offence would be guilty of a federal summary conviction offence and subject to a mandatory fine and federal driving prohibition. The proposed Criminal Code .05% offence would apply uniformly throughout Canada. The federal sanctions have the potential to have a far greater deterrent impact than the existing patchwork of provincial and territorial short term roadside suspensions.</ParaText><ParaText id="767995">Those who violate the proposed Criminal Code offence would be guilty of a federal summary conviction offence and subject to a mandatory fine and federal driving suspension, and it would apply uniformly throughout Canada. </ParaText>

Every member who spoke to the bill and I am sure every member of the House agreed with the goal to reduce the death toll and injury on our highways caused by impaired drivers. </ParaText><ParaText id="768008">However, serious concerns regarding the mechanics of the bill, particularly its proposal to create a Criminal Code ticket and whether it would be used by police, were expressed by members. </ParaText><ParaText id="768009">For many years, law enforcement and prosecutors have complained about the complexities of the current impaired driving laws, the time needed to process the charge, the length of trials and the number of cases that are lost on technicalities. They have not asked for a lower blood alcohol content.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="768010">I am pleased that the government has responded to those concerns. Bill <Document DbId="3076458" Type="3">C-2</Document>, the tackling violent crime act, would simplify procedures and restrict defences to over .08 charges to those that have scientific validity. However, Bill <Document DbId="3076458" Type="3">C-2</Document> is not a substitute for a complete review of the impaired driving provisions of the Criminal Code.</ParaText><ParaText id="768011">As members know, the Criminal Code has two separate and distinct drinking and driving criminal offences. Under section 253(a), it is a crime to drive while one's ability to drive is impaired by alcohol or a drug. Under section 253(b), it is an offence to drive while one's blood alcohol content exceeds .08. The over .08 offence was enacted in 1969, based on a seminal scientific study in Michigan showing that at that level the risk of collision increases exponentially for all drivers, regardless of age, driving experience and drinking experience. The Michigan study has been validated repeatedly.</ParaText><ParaText id="768012">Recent studies have concentrated on impairment at .05. I believe there is a scientific consensus that indicates a degradation in driving skills and increased risk of accident at that level.</ParaText><ParaText id="768013">One study concluded that compared with a driver at zero blood alcohol content, a driver at .05 had a 38% greater chance of being involved in a collision. A driver at .06 had a 63% higher risk and a driver at .07 had a 109% higher risk.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="768014">To date, Canada has chosen to address the problem of the driver who is over .05 but less than .08 through administrative measures imposed by provinces pursuant to their legislative authority to address licensing matters and matters of the Highway Traffic Act.</ParaText><ParaText id="768015">All provinces and territories except Quebec already have a roadside suspension for being over .05. I am pleased to say that Quebec has announced that it will soon be introducing a suspension at that level. These suspensions occur without any criminal charge being laid and, therefore, without a trial. They are an immediate and certain road safety measure.</ParaText><ParaText id="768016">The issue for the House, I submit, therefore, is whether to lower the permissible blood alcohol content to .05 or leave the low blood alcohol content driver to be dealt with by the province, at least until there has been a comprehensive review of impaired driving countermeasures.</ParaText><ParaText id="768017">The provinces work together through the Canadian Council of Motor Vehicle Transport Administrators or CCMTA, which has a subcommittee on impaired driving. The CCMTA reports to federal, provincial and territorial transport ministers. The CCMTA has endorsed a model of sanctions for driving while being over .05 that would include the recording of violations, longer roadside suspensions, a licence reinstatement fee of $150 to $300 and recording the violation for 10 years so that repeat violators can attract higher sanctions.</ParaText>

							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="768023">This question has been quite active in the last five sitting days of the House. The Liberal Party has been hammering away asking for a public inquiry and giving the reasons why there should be a public inquiry. Finally we learned today that such an inquiry will be called. Unfortunately, we do not know the scope of the inquiry and we do not know when the inquiry will begin. Therefore, it is important that we take a step back and see how this all came to be.</ParaText><ParaText id="768024">Members will remember hearing this in the House and seeing media reports about it shortly after the government took power. When it became public in government documents, in documents filed with the court, that Mr. Mulroney had accepted a $300,000 cash payment from Mr. Schreiber and did not declare the taxes on it at the time but declared them some five years later through voluntary disclosure to avoid penalty, the current <Affiliation DbId="105829" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation>, who was then the minister of justice, asked the department for a briefing on this matter. His thinking, which was right at the time, was that perhaps we should recover the $2.1 million in taxpayer funds that had been given to Mr. Mulroney and that if some of the funds had not been paid out, then they should not be.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="768025">We subsequently learned that an order from somewhere on high went to the ministry that they should not brief the minister. Therefore, the minister was not briefed. </ParaText><ParaText id="768026">The person who is making these allegations against Mr. Mulroney is in a holding facility awaiting deportation to Germany where he faces some tax evasion charges. The day that he was going to court to hear exactly whether or not his appeal would be heard and if he would be able to remain in Canada because he raises certain points, at six o'clock in the morning, the RCMP went to the holding facility and told him they had to bring him with them because new charges were being laid and he had to go to court. He contacted his lawyer and found out that that was not true. Obviously, the government was preparing to, the minute that the court rendered its decision, throw him on a plane and get him out of the country so that he could not file a leave for appeal or ask for a stay of surrender. It would have been very convenient for the Conservative government because nobody else is going to speak in this matter, nobody else has the information that he has. Luckily, his lawyers were able to keep him in the country. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="768027">Then we started to find out a lot of other things about the Schreiber-Mulroney affair. We found out that he put a lot of pressure and finally Mr. Schreiber told us that he saw Mr. Mulroney when he was still in office, that he made a deal with Mr. Mulroney for the $300,000 while Mr. Mulroney was still the prime minister and that he gave him the first $100,000 when Mr. Mulroney was still a sitting member of Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="768028">Those allegations came to light and that forced the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister </Affiliation> to react. Last Friday he told us that he is going to name an independent person to advise him on what he should know is his duty to call for a full public inquiry. Today after more pressure and suggestions by Mr. Mulroney that there should be such an inquiry, he said that that person will tell him what the scope of the inquiry should be.</ParaText><ParaText id="768029">I will tell the minister, through the parliamentary secretary, what the scope should be.

He should be able to look at the whole question. </ParaText><ParaText id="768030">Perhaps Mr. Mulroney is innocent of a major crime.

When new allegations surfaced, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> acted immediately and called upon an independent third party to, first, give advice to the government on how to proceed and then, when subsequent new allegations were made, acted even more decisively and now has called upon that independent third party to give terms of reference for a public inquiry to the government.</ParaText><ParaText id="768034">That is acting not only appropriately but swiftly, something that my friends in the Liberal opposition never knew how to do while they were in government. In fact, I would question why, when the issue of the $300,000 first surfaced in 2003, the former Liberal government did nothing.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="768035">Would one not think that since they are so up in arms about the $300,000 today that some red flags might have been raised in 2003 when they first learned about it, when it first became public? However, they did nothing. Now it is convenient for them because they are trying to engage, as they always do, in a political witch hunt.</ParaText><ParaText id="768036">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said that we will have a public inquiry. I would suggest to all members in the House that it is the appropriate action to take place. We obviously will not be able to set the terms of reference ourselves, nor should we. I am amazed that members opposite would suggest that the government set the terms of reference. We are talking about an inquiry affecting the Office of the Prime Minister, the highest office in the land.</ParaText><ParaText id="768037">For opposition members to even remotely suggest that the government of the day should set its own terms of reference into an inquiry about the Office of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is absurd. Of course we need to have an independent analysis of that and set the terms of reference, otherwise there would be clear conflict. It is a very fundamental concept and, I would suggest, even a tenet of democracy that the member and others do not understand.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="768038">Once that independent third party, who I am sure will be an eminent, qualified Canadian, makes his or her recommendations, we will move swiftly to hold a public inquiry to examine all aspects of the allegations that have been made. I must also say that everyone knows those allegations are only that, unfounded and unproven allegations. </ParaText><ParaText id="768039">In a final response to the member who is suggesting perhaps that the government step in and stop extradition proceedings that have been going on now for eight years against Mr. Schreiber, that is absolutely absurd. The government cannot affect ongoing investigations or extradition proceedings. We cannot do that. We agree that Mr. Schreiber will be a key individual whose testimony should be examined. Mr. Mulroney's testimony should be examined.</ParaText><ParaText id="768040">There are many other elements to this case, if we want to call it that, that should be examined and that is why we have called for a full scale, independent judicial inquiry or at least a public inquiry, perhaps not judicial. We will have to wait to see what the independent third party suggests.</ParaText><ParaText id="768041">We have taken not only swift and decisive action, we have taken appropriate action.

Accordingly, Transport Canada worked closely with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans on arriving at a Government of Canada position on the project. </ParaText><ParaText id="768063">It has been a lengthy but essential process for the people of Canada as Transport Canada had to take into consideration the relevant factors associated with the project's options put forward by the province of New Brunswick and the findings of the province's extensive environmental impact assessment report.</ParaText><ParaText id="768064">As I mentioned, this report, done in partnership with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, took approximately three years to complete. The purpose of the report was to evaluate and compare the potential environmental effects of the project options, all of which included an alteration to the current state of the river.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="768065">Naturally, any substantial change to the existing state of the river needed to be fully examined, which is so important, especially after the 40 years that this project has been in that particular state and 13 years of neglect by the previous Liberal government. This had to be carried out prior to making a decision to authorize the project under the Navigable Waters Protection Act and in the best interests of the people.</ParaText><ParaText id="768066">Furthermore, the province announced in August of this year its decision on which of the four options it preferred. The provincial government opted to replace the existing causeway with a bridge, which of course is within its jurisdiction to decide. With the preferred option identified, it was necessary for the department to ensure the specific legislative requirements under the Navigable Waters Protection Act for the construction of the 280 metre long bridge for the province.</ParaText><ParaText id="768067">Upon completion of the application and authorization process, the department issued a formal approval of the construction of the bridge on November 7, 2007. The province is now responsible for the implementation of the project requirements, including the terms and conditions associated with the authorization including those outlined in the province's own environmental impact assessment report.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="768068">Regarding the request for funding for this particular project, Infrastructure Canada officials have met with Premier Graham. Given the information that we have provided, the Petitcodiac River project is ineligible for funding under the building Canada fund. This type of project does not fall under the categories of core national highway system projects, which is so important across the country, or under the locally owned road projects. As such, funding for the project rightly rests with the government of New Brunswick.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Would it be the member's understanding, I wonder, whether 50% funding was previously offered to the province of New Brunswick for funding of this project. In that he answered that the building Canada fund was not eligible for this project, are there other programs under which this project might fit?</ParaText><ParaText id="768070">I wonder whether he is suggesting that the legal challenge brought by the river keepers is now a moot point in that the government has decided that it has no legal obligation to restore the river and replace the causeway with a bridge, and whether the government will be filing, in other words, a removal or deceasement of the defence that was filed by the Government of Canada in the Federal Court.</ParaText><ParaText id="768071">Finally, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78791" Type="2">Fundy Royal</Affiliation> seems to have been very--</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Where has the member been? I know he asked one particular question, but indeed, where was he?</ParaText><ParaText id="768074">On September 22, 2003, there was a press release by Environment Canada where the municipality of the city of Moncton pleaded guilty to federal environmental charges related to the decommissioned landfill. I go on to quote: “This is the first time that a municipality has been prosecuted by Environment Canada for landfill problems”. That is right. He was involved because he was the mayor of Moncton at that time and was in charge of such a disastrous thing. Do we want him to do that again? No. This government is acting in the best interests of Canadians and we will continue to do so in a fair and equitable manner.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It seems that these assurances have gone the same way as income trusts and health wait times promises.</ParaText><ParaText id="768078">Right now, in anticipation of the busiest foreign travel season in some time, the booming Canadian dollar and the looming passport requirements at the Canada-U.S. borders, incredibly there is still a growing backlog and an admitted minimum six week delay to receive mail-in passports when the benchmark is four weeks. In fact, the reality is several months or longer. Two out of these three factors were known months in advance and still Canadians must suffer the consequences of poor planning.</ParaText><ParaText id="768079">Last January, the Auditor General specifically singled out the Conservatives because they had no plan to deal with the demand for passports. It appears they still have no plan and Canadians are the ones who are paying the price in cancelled trips and sheer frustration.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="768080">As a member of Parliament, my staff and I are on the receiving end of the irate calls from constituents who have to cancel, sometimes at great expense, business and personal trips after waiting months in vain for their passports.</ParaText><ParaText id="768081">In one case, two families sent in their applications at the same time because they planned to travel to Mexico together. After three months, only one family's applications were processed. The other family was told that their applications may be in a pile of unopened applications. Since the original birth certificates were in the unopened passport applications, their only option in order to travel to Mexico the following week was to go to Toronto and reapply for birth certificates that allowed admission to that country.</ParaText><ParaText id="768082">Last June, another constituent had to purchase a new birth certificate and reapply in person at the St. Catharines Passport Office because his mail-in application, that was submitted six weeks previously, was also not yet opened, let alone considered. At that time, the passport office informed us that it was currently working on applications received eight to twelve weeks prior.</ParaText><ParaText id="768083">These stories are not the fault of the overextended staff, only the fault of the government in not providing the extra resources that they need to keep up to the level of service expected.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="768084">In Niagara, the looming deadline of the western hemisphere travel initiative at our land border crossings is causing an additional strain on both our local passport office and the mail-in resources. On January 31, 2008, all Canadians entering the United States at a land border crossing must have a valid passport, a measure that disproportionately affects those who live in border communities such as Niagara.</ParaText><ParaText id="768085">For those of us who live adjacent to the border, the reality is that we move frequently and seamlessly between the two countries for work, cultural and sporting events, attending church or visiting family and friends. The pressure of this January 31, 2008, deadline is going to result in an ongoing increase of applications for the foreseeable future.</ParaText><ParaText id="768086">When is this government going to get control of this situation?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Since April 2007, the start of the fiscal year, Passport Canada has issued over 2.4 million passports, a 43% increase over the same period in 2006-07.</ParaText><ParaText id="768089">The agency now anticipates issuing close to 4.7 million passports during this fiscal year. By comparison, it issued approximately a third of this number in the year 2000.</ParaText><ParaText id="768090">Under our government, Passport Canada is making every possible effort to ready itself for the winter months and remains committed to ensuring that Canadians receive the highest standard of passport services.</ParaText><ParaText id="768091">To help expedite the passport issuing process, our government has recently implemented a series of initiatives to modernize the services and increase its capacity to better meet demand.</ParaText><ParaText id="768092">Between April and November 2007, we hired close to 800 employees, modernized printing equipment, streamlined application processes, held weekend blitzes and overtime, extended office hours in several offices, increased the call centres' capacity, and improved overall access to services.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="768093">Since August 15, eligible Canadians are able to renew their passports by means of a new simplified process.</ParaText><ParaText id="768094">Meanwhile, a new guarantor policy was also introduced on October 1. The new simplified guarantor policy will allow most Canadian adult passport holders to act as guarantors for applicants who are still required to complete the general passport application form.</ParaText><ParaText id="768095">Please bear in mind that measures taken by our government to reduce waiting times will never jeopardize the security and the integrity of the Canadian passport. As a result of these numerous initiatives, Passport Canada has significantly reduced its inventory and service delays. I am proud to say that under this government, Passport Canada is now able to issue over 20,000 passports each and every day.</ParaText><ParaText id="768096">Passport Canada offices can issue passports in two weeks. Approximately 80% of all applications are processed through passport offices. Two week service for passports is one of the fastest turnarounds in the world. First-time applicants in the United Kingdom are advised to allow at least six weeks for their passport to be issued. The United States processes applications within four to six weeks.</ParaText><ParaText id="768097">Mailed in applications are now processed in six weeks, compared to 12 weeks earlier, and applications submitted through receiving agents are processed in five weeks or less. Complex cases may require more time, however. In short, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78608" Type="2">Welland</Affiliation> will be pleased to know that under this Conservative government, delays are going down, not up.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I commend our passport personnel for their exemplary service. I know the St. Catharines passport office is under exceptional pressure, yet has always come through in the emergency cases it handles. Taking an application directly to a passport office is definitely the best way to get a passport right now.</ParaText><ParaText id="768099">Unfortunately, the majority of Canadians do not have access to a passport office and must rely on the mail-in system and worry if they will have a passport in time for a travel date.</ParaText><ParaText id="768100">Canadians deserve better. Will the minister responsible for Passport Canada admit that he has not done his job? His government is aware of the annual increase of applications over the winter months and has been aware of the implementation of the WHTI since it took office in January 2006. </ParaText><ParaText id="768101">Canadians are still waiting for the not so new, and indeed aging, government to fix the problem. The member opposite simply does not get it. The initiatives undertaken, as elaborated upon by the parliamentary secretary, simply do not cut it. They are insufficient. The Auditor General is waiting for them to fix the problem.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="768102">Will the minister finally take full responsibility for delays at the passport office and remedy this unacceptable situation? How long will the government continue to mishandle this file? How long will it be before Canadians get their passport when they actually need it?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

In fact, we have opened up 60 new service points, so now 84% of all Canadians are within a 50 kilometre radius of a passport office. This is a level of service that we have never seen before, particularly under the Liberal government that preceded us.</ParaText><ParaText id="768104">I also suggest to the member that he may want to take a look at some of the things individual Conservative members of Parliament are doing. I conduct passport clinics throughout the rural portion of my riding. For people who do not have close access to a passport office, I take a passport clinic to the constituency, to the small towns and villages. I bring passport officials with me. I bring qualified passport photographers. We process passport applications on site, with qualified passport officials from Ottawa. Therefore, I can guarantee that 100% of the people in my riding have equal and quick access to all passport services.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
