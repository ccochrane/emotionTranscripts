Second reading</ProceduralText><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Marston" id="1663201"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78549" Type="2">Mr. Wayne Marston (Hamilton East—Stoney Creek, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="91039">Mr. Speaker, I rise today on Bill <Document DbId="2334521" Type="3">C-24</Document>, the bill put forward by the <Affiliation DbId="78741" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation>, the softwood lumber products export charge act, 2006 </ParaText><ParaText id="91040">As I was considering the fact that I would be speaking today, a thought crossed my mind that this softwood sellout kind of matches a definition I have used for years relative to some folks who have passed through the House, ministers, members, even governments, that we ordinary folk call rogues and scoundrels. </ParaText><ParaText id="91041">Mostly, the common people on the street will say it is their view that far too many people who have sat in the House or held official positions in the House have been quick to bow to an American policy on one file or another. One of the first that comes to mind, maybe even the most notorious up until this point in time especially in the minds of working Canadians, was the act of former Prime Minister John Diefenbaker when he caved into Dwight D. Eisenhower in the late 1950s. It was that prime minister, a Conservative prime minister by the way, who bowed to President Dwight D. Eisenhower and cancelled the Avro Arrow project.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91042">In fact, we were reminded just this week that there is a prototype of the Avro Arrow that has been restored and taken to one of our national museums to be put on display I guess to say what might have been. At the time of the cancellation of that project there were five leading prototypes of an aircraft that was 20 years ahead of its time.</ParaText><ParaText id="91043">What happened on Black Friday? Prime Minister Diefenbaker cancelled this project and cancelled the futures of over 15,000 workers when he did that. One has to sit back and wonder why. Why would a government turn on its own people in that fashion?</ParaText><ParaText id="91044">Then again in the 1980s many of us, including myself in the Hamilton labour movement, saw then Prime Minister Brian Mulroney sign the free trade agreement which basically sacrificed over 500,000 manufacturing jobs in Ontario, not to mention across this country. My riding of <Affiliation DbId="78549" Type="2">Hamilton East—Stoney Creek</Affiliation> was affected in major ways.</ParaText><ParaText id="91045">I can recall when the draft text of the free trade agreement was signed. That very day Firestone Tire announced the closure of the plant in Hamilton because it no longer needed a plant. It could simply bring goods across the border. Thus, 1,500 people lost their jobs.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91046">Not to pick on just the Conservatives, but maybe to throw a little fire across the way to the former Liberals, it was in the 1990s, as we will recall, that the Liberal Party ran on a platform in the 1993 election saying that it would not support the GST and would cancel it. It would not sign NAFTA. I recall a full page newspaper ad that had five priorities of things it would and would not do and those were the top two on that list. Lo and behold, what did it do? It kept the GST and signed the free trade agreement and again workers in my city were sold down the river.</ParaText><ParaText id="91047">We will recall not too long after that event the member from Hamilton at the time resigned on the basis that she had given her word that if the GST was kept, she would resign. A byelection took place. In fact, I was the candidate for my party in that byelection. We went from fifth place to second place just simply on the anger that the people had at the time for what was going on.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91048">Steelworkers and manufacturers in my area wonder what is next. They see this softwood sellout. It is little wonder they do not trust the government after the previous Liberal and Conservative governments have sold them down the river. Now there is a spectacle by the present government. In the campaign it ran on being a fresh face, accountability and all of those grand words. What happened? Lo and behold, just before the House convened it had an unelected person appointed as a senator.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="05">(1005)</Timestamp><ParaText id="91049">Then, further embarrassing to the House I would suggest, we had the minister who had the file on softwood lumber cross the floor two short weeks after the election. People in that member's riding, who worked hard to elect a Liberal, suddenly found themselves waking up one morning with a Conservative member.</ParaText><ParaText id="91050">Maybe I should have said switching allegiances because he did not physically get up and cross the floor. I think that would have taken a bit of courage and I do not see too much of that.</ParaText><ParaText id="91051">The government expects steelworkers, autoworkers and other workers in manufacturing in my riding to have faith in the <Affiliation DbId="78741" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation>. I can say there is not a chance of that. They are cringing. They are wondering what industry is next, that perhaps it will be one of theirs.</ParaText><ParaText id="91052">Our critic on this file from <Affiliation DbId="78654" Type="2">Burnaby—New Westminster</Affiliation> has been warning the people of the country and the members in the House of what is happening. The critic has been in the House day in and day out drawing the attention of Canadians to this file. He has exposed the hidden costs of the softwood agreement to Canadians. He has also exposed the bullying tactics of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> as the government goes after the industry to force it to support the agreement.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91053">I have a quote from our critic. He said:</ParaText><ParaText id="91054"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The [Conservative] government, who used bullying tactics to force support from the industry, is now using the tax system to punish his opponents.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="91055">The word is today, at least in some of the circles I was travelling in this morning, this deal may well be in trouble. If that is the case, it is certainly good news to this member's ears.</ParaText><ParaText id="91056">He also said:</ParaText><ParaText id="91057"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Under the softwood lumber agreement, [the Prime Minister] and the [Minister of International Trade] are coercing Canadian softwood companies to hand over to the United States $1 billion of the $5.3 billion in duty deposits illegally collected by the Unites States Customs as a result of the softwood lumber dispute.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="91058">On top of that, we have had case after case where we have won rulings on this dispute. It is beyond me why our government would cave in and position us in front of the Americans as people who are on our knees when we do not have to be. We can win the next round of legal battles, the future litigation that is going to carry on, but more importantly, we have to prepare the way for the next sector that comes under attack from the Americans.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91059">The Conservative government is again slapping on the Canadian softwood companies that refuse to join in this fiasco, for the lack of a better word, a 19% charge applied as a percentage of the refunded deposits. The charge would not be collected from companies who abide by the agreement. This is an abuse of power, especially when we have won, as I have said before, in the court of law. Canadian companies owe nothing to the United States. It baffles me why we are giving a billion dollars to the Americans.</ParaText><ParaText id="91060">Steelworkers and members from Hamilton are very concerned. American litigation will likely resume on future files. The Bush government recently moved to overturn the U.S. court decisions of April 7 and July 14 on the NAFTA and the Byrd amendment. This is clearly a very plain and simple, even simple enough for the government to get it, indication of what is coming.</ParaText><ParaText id="91061">We have a dispute settlement mechanism within NAFTA that we are flouting with this agreement. It is beyond belief that our government would do this to the workers in the softwood industry.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp><ParaText id="91062">Our leader was in Thunder Bay recently. He was there to show the workers that at least some members in this House were standing with them on this. It was very clear that the members of the government were not.</ParaText><ParaText id="91063"> In the words of our leader, “The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has sold out northern Ontario”. That is a fact. “This is a total failure,” he said. “One billion dollars left on the table in Washington”, he said, but worse, “the Bush administration now has a direct say in how we manage our forestry industry”. </ParaText><ParaText id="91064">Clearly, the actions of the <Affiliation DbId="78741" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation> fly in the face of democracy. I say the minister has sold out our country. He deserves to be ranked among the rogues and scoundrels that I spoke of in my opening remarks. I think the government will go down in history for this, maybe not ahead of the Diefenbaker government for cancelling the Avro, but it will be very close on the sellout of softwood lumber.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Szabo" id="1663269"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78477" Type="2">Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="91065">Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his input on this important debate.</ParaText><ParaText id="91066">We have had several days of debate on this whole issue of softwood lumber, but what I have not heard from members is what I think is the real issue. The real issue is about trade. It is about trade under NAFTA. It is about the years that this country has spent to build up trade relationships under the various treaties we have.</ParaText><ParaText id="91067">I am very concerned about the whole issue of dispute settlement mechanisms. It appears that notwithstanding all this work that was done to establish the rules of the game, those rules have been set aside, through bullying tactics, to impose a deal on those who have no choice. I wonder if the member would care to comment on that.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Marston" id="1663271"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78549" Type="2">Mr. Wayne Marston</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="91068">Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite for raising this. As I referred to in my remarks, under our trade agreements we have a dispute settlement mechanism that we may as well not have. It is astounding.</ParaText><ParaText id="91069"> The member talked people being forced off an issue, but when it is our own government that is forcing us off the issue, that is amazing. Our own <Affiliation DbId="78741" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation> is pushing at Canadian companies. It astounds me. Members might note that I am lost for words at times on this, because it flies in the face of everything that this House represents or that a minister should represent in this House.</ParaText><ParaText id="91070">As for our role, I will remind the Conservative members that they had as their campaign slogan “Stand up for Canada”. If this is the way the <Affiliation DbId="78741" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation> will stand up for Canada, God help us all.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Goodyear" id="1663274"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78351" Type="2">Mr. Gary Goodyear (Cambridge, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="91071">Mr. Speaker, I was not going to ask any questions this morning, but I think the member from the no democracy party has drifted off the ranks.</ParaText><ParaText id="91072">I would just like to bring to our minds the fact that Canadians know very well why the Liberals failed to reach this agreement. It was partly because there was no leadership on that side of the House and partly because they saw the phenomenal financial benefits of dragging out the litigation for another seven to 10 years.</ParaText><ParaText id="91073"> In January, Canadians chose change. They chose a leader who actually brought together a deal that, frankly, represents the wishes and the needs of 90% of the lumber community in Canada. It helps save families' incomes. It allows us to move forward. One would arguably agree, in fact, that the better relationships this <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has been able to establish around the world have allowed us to bring this agreement together.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91074">There is one thing I would like to ask the member to comment on, because of course he is telling us all these woeful things. I do remember back when NAFTA was brought in by another government with leadership, and our economy is extremely strong today as a direct result of that NAFTA agreement.</ParaText><ParaText id="91075"> I just wondered if the member could comment. I am from Ontario. I remember the Rae days. It took a decade for Ontario to pull itself out of the economic bliss that Bob Rae as premier got us into, yet on the federal level we entered an economic boom as a result of a Conservative government with leadership.</ParaText><ParaText id="91076"> I do not know whether the member wants to comment on that embarrassing period in the history of Canada, particularly Ontario, but maybe he wants to tell us why 90% of the lumber industry wants this agreement. The member has his head in the sand in thinking we should just go on forever with litigation. Maybe he wants to comment on that in some logical way.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Marston" id="1663289"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78549" Type="2">Mr. Wayne Marston</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="91077">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to hear that the member heard my previous logic.</ParaText><ParaText id="91078">On the situation in Ontario in 1990, the hon. member asked about the government of the day. As I recall, that was two years into the free trade agreement. The 500,000 lost Ontario jobs that I just spoke of took away funding from the tax base. We were in the worst recession in the history of our country at that time. That government ran three successive deficits of $10 billion, $9 billion and $8 billion to keep people employed and to keep the economy moving.</ParaText><ParaText id="91079"> Would I have made the same choices? I do not know. I was not sitting around the cabinet table. Did I agree with the social contract? No, I did not agree with the social contract, end of story.</ParaText><ParaText id="91080">Getting back to the hon. member's point, he talked about how the previous government showed no leadership and all kinds of things around that particular file. I will remind you that you brought the Minister of International Trade--</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Blaikie" id="1663291"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="81494" Type="96">The Deputy Speaker</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="91081">Order. I caution the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78549" Type="2">Hamilton East—Stoney Creek</Affiliation> that he should be speaking to the hon. member through the Chair, not using the second person. He did that a couple of times and I let it slide, but if he keeps doing it, I have to bring it to his attention.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Marston" id="1663292"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78549" Type="2">Mr. Wayne Marston</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="91082">Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the help. I am a new member in the House and your advice is always well received.</ParaText><ParaText id="91083">Again, all I can say is that in my view, in the view of my party and in the view of the critic in this area, this softwood deal is a major sellout. I stand by that.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Keeper" id="1663294"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78912" Type="2">Ms. Tina Keeper (Churchill, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="91084">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on Bill <Document DbId="2334521" Type="3">C-24</Document>, otherwise known as the softwood lumber products export charge act.</ParaText><ParaText id="91085">The dispute has been of particular interest to me, as the lumber industry is an important contributor to the economy of my riding of Churchill. It is certainly a critical issue and is of critical concern to the men and women who work in this industry in my riding. </ParaText><ParaText id="91086">Not only has the softwood lumber sellout been an issue of considerable local concern, but it is of course of concern throughout the country given the immense trade that takes place between Canada and the United States. This trade has a long history. It has developed over time and represents a history that is fundamental to the trade between our countries.</ParaText><ParaText id="91087">Today, over 37,000 trucks cross over the Canadian-American border daily. In 2003, two way trade in goods and services exceeds $441.5 billion, which firmly establishes Canada and the U.S. as the world's largest trade relationship. The economies of our two countries are intertwined. Cooperation and respect are therefore essential components in order for this relationship to flourish. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91088">No one in the House can deny the importance of trade with our closest friend and nearest neighbour. Trade is a two way street and it must be mutually respected in order to maximize efficiency. To this end, various trade courts and tribunals have been established to assist if and when trade disputes emerge. In fact, while exhausting such avenues in respect to the longstanding softwood lumber dispute, it was ruled in a variety of courts that Canada's practices in the softwood industry complied with international law. </ParaText><ParaText id="91089">Whether we took our case to the North American Free Trade Agreement tribunals, the World Trade Organization or U.S. courts, Canada always seemed to come out successfully. As recently as July 14, 2006, the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled in favour of Canada, concluding that the American tariffs and duties were in fact illegal. As well, NAFTA and WTO judgments were clear that our industry was not subsidized.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91090"> If this was indeed the conclusion, why did Canada settle for anything less? Canadians deserve better. We had won all the challenges and it is believed that the U.S. would have exhausted appeals within a short period. </ParaText><ParaText id="91091">The Conservatives did not fully appreciate, it seems, all that was at stake. There was much more at stake than simply the capital that was owed. First, Canadian sovereignty was at stake. Canada must have the courage to stand up to even the strongest of powers. Second, ensuring that the United States respected our trade agreement was also at stake. This settlement sets the stage and ensures that Americans do not take our agreement seriously. </ParaText><ParaText id="91092">This in effect highlights another point: the credibility of our dispute mechanism. By compromising the rulings found by the dispute resolution provisions of NAFTA, we are destroying the credibility of the dispute mechanism as a whole. Moreover, and most important, I have spoken with the industry in my riding and I would like to take this time to talk about its position and its displeasure.</ParaText><ParaText id="91093">The United Steelworkers in my riding have expressed great concern and frustration with this agreement. The union represents forestry workers in many communities throughout my riding and across Manitoba. Those communities include Thompson, Wabowden, Cranberry, Moose Lake, The Pas, Birch River, Swan River, Roblin, Neepawa, and even Winnipeg, which is not in my riding.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp><ParaText id="91094">The president of the local has denounced the agreement, and on August 24 he stated, “This is a devastating deal with possibilities of having even higher penalties imposed on our lumber exports when prices fall, and a quota system legislated by the U.S. that will downsize operations”. He went on to say, “[The Prime Minister] has done nothing in this effort to meet with Canadian workers and hear us...This isn't a respectful agreement. This is a sellout”.</ParaText><ParaText id="91095">This represents the concerns and the position of the forestry workers in my riding. They believe this deal is a sellout. The minority government has simply abandoned them.</ParaText><ParaText id="91096">While the softwood lumber dispute was certainly on the forefront, its existence was by no means unique. In fact, a number of other trade disputes have emerged between Canada and the United States in the past. There have been disagreements with Canada Post and the Canadian Wheat Board among other things.</ParaText><ParaText id="91097">When the minority government finalized its agreement with the <?bk?>U.S.,<?ek?> it in effect sent a strong message to both Canadians and Americans.</ParaText><ParaText id="91098">Canadians, particularly those in trade disputes, despite how many international court challenges they win, now understand that, under Conservative leadership, there is a possibility, and a very good possibility, that they will be compromised. Simultaneously, Americans, particularly those in trade disputes, despite how many international court challenges they lose, now understand that, under Canadian Conservative leadership, anything is possible.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91099">Are Canadian industries wrong to believe that if they find themselves in a trade dispute, the government may settle for much less than they deserve?</ParaText><ParaText id="91100">The agreement has left $500 million for the American lumber industry. This $500 million should have been returned to Canadians. This so-called deal created an export tax, which at current price levels, is higher than current U.S. duties.</ParaText><ParaText id="91101">Canadians deserve better. The men and women working in the forest sector in my riding have worked too hard to have the government simply sign their industry over to the Americans.</ParaText><ParaText id="91102">In addition to this disconcerting precedent, the agreement has already begun to have consequences on production. For example, as a direct result, one of the operations in my riding in northern Manitoba had to eliminate the night shift, immediately. It has also stated that further employment opportunities will be reduced as a result of the agreement. </ParaText><ParaText id="91103">This is an outrage. How could the industry in my riding possibly approve an agreement that would have such negative implications? How could I, as their respected member of Parliament, support an agreement that would cut jobs and lower wages?</ParaText><ParaText id="91104">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his government bullied the Canadian industry with an ultimatum. The Conservatives have illustrated that they are willing to punish sectors of the industry and companies that refuse to support them by leaving them behind, and this is exactly what has happened.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91105">Canada is a strong country. There is no good reason why a Canadian government must compromise and sacrifice our industry. We owe it to our lumber industry to support them with a solid deal.</ParaText><ParaText id="91106">Despite what they argue, there were alternatives. The Liberal Party proposed a supplementary aid package that included: $200 million over two years to enhance the forest industry's competitive position, improve its environmental performance and take advantage of the growing bio-economy; $40 million over two years to improve the overall performance of the national forest innovation system; $30 million over two years to improve the competitiveness of the workforce, promote upgrading of workplace skills and provide assistance to older workers impacted by forestry industry layoffs; $100 million over two years to support economic diversification and capacity building in communities affected by job losses in the forest industry; $30 million over two years to develop new markets for Canadian wood products; and $200 million over two years to fight the spread of the pine beetle in B.C. forests.</ParaText><ParaText id="91107">In addition, the previous Liberal government offered the industry to either accept a negotiated settlement or continue the justified legal actions, which we would have supported by providing loan guarantees, reinvestment support, community and worker adjustment and assistance with legal costs. The Liberal Party also offered solutions and alternatives to the forest industry.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp><ParaText id="91108">I have risen today to speak on behalf of the forestry workers in my <Affiliation DbId="78912" Type="2">Churchill</Affiliation> riding and, indeed, all workers across the country that have been left with the consequences of this careless agreement. I have joined them in their fight to ensure they have a future and proud livelihood. </ParaText><ParaText id="91109">Canadians deserve better. With this in mind I can never support such an agreement.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Davies" id="1663302"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78973" Type="2">Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="91110">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate hearing the comments of the member for <Affiliation DbId="78912" Type="2">Churchill</Affiliation>. She spoke about the impact in her riding, particularly on smaller communities, individual families and workers. We do not hear very much about this. We have heard a lot from the government that the deal is supported by the industry. In actual fact, I believe we are looking at very large corporations with their backs to the wall.</ParaText><ParaText id="91111">As we learn more and more about the agreement, and as the member for <Affiliation DbId="78549" Type="2">Hamilton East—Stoney Creek</Affiliation> pointed out earlier, it seems to be unravelling. I think there is more and more unease and concern of what the impact of this deal will really be.</ParaText><ParaText id="91112">I am from British Columbia. There is no doubt a huge impact on local communities as a result of this agreement. One of the things that really puzzles me is the agreement does not seem to be based on any industrial strategy, a strategy that looks at Canadian resources in a way that sustains our environment, protects jobs and produces value added products.

Certainly the concern is the immediate impacts that will be felt because of this deal.</ParaText><ParaText id="91115">One of the first things that happened was a night shift was lost. Because of the quota system, there is great fear that the agreement will have a serious impact. It has been made clear to the workers in the smaller mills that this is likely to happen.</ParaText><ParaText id="91116">What seems to be important is the government seemed anxious to strike a deal. Perhaps it was politically motivated and done in haste. I know it has been mentioned several times that there has been a long history surrounding the agreement, and there is. It represents years of hard work, efforts and challenges, which were won on behalf of Canadians. Many believed this would continue into the near future. It was the role of the previous Liberal government to support the industry so it could continue with those challenges.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91117">Workers in my riding do not often talk about jobs lost, but it is a primary concern. They are talking about sovereignty issues and the future of our country. The workers feel the agreement is a clear sign that Canada is selling out and that our rights are sailing down the rivers and the lakes.</ParaText><ParaText id="91118">We need to support the industry. We need to look to incentives to help the industry develop in other areas.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Bevington" id="1663363"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="79025" Type="2">Mr. Dennis Bevington (Western Arctic, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="91119">Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on to the bill in front of us.</ParaText><ParaText id="91120"> I have heard the debate over the previous number of days and have followed it in the press and throughout the time I have been in Parliament. I have tried to put it in the perspective of the north. We are mentioned in the bill because the Northwest Territories, Yukon and Nunavut get an exemption under the clauses.</ParaText><ParaText id="91121">In some ways that is a result of certain trade links we have with the state of Alaska. Certainly the United States does not mind taking care of its own. In terms of Alaska and the relationship of how it receives lumber from some of the north, the United States is very good about taking care of its own. That speaks volumes about the United States and suggests to me volumes about what Canada is about right now.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91122">This agreement is about short term gain for long term pain. Let us look at it from a perspective of what the government is trying to accomplish. The government is very interested in moving toward a majority in Parliament the next time an election is called. It is very interested in appearing to be decisive and able to deal with issues. I think this has triggered the effort that has gone into selling out our industry. It is short term gain.</ParaText><ParaText id="91123">There will be short term gain in the industry as well, because the industry is starved for dollars and opportunities. We will get some investment dollars back in the short term. Companies will be able to hang on for a little longer and continue to work in the industry. However, we are in a North American market where housing has boomed for many years and now it is starting to die. When housing dies, the requirement for forest products die and the prices drop.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91124">As the prices drop, the duties come in, so our industry will get the double whammy. Not only will we not have prices that are strong, but we will also have a duty imposed on us. That duty will drive us further into the ground. As time goes on, the industry will either shrink or the corporations will recognize that unprocessed raw logs will continue to cross the border duty-free. Their incentive, as the prices drop and as the duties come on, will be to relocate manufacturing and processing of wood into the United States. That is exactly what will happen with this deal.</ParaText><ParaText id="91125">Where will we be at the end of the day with our lumber industry? We will be in long term pain. That is what we will get from this deal. We will get a short term gain and long term pain.</ParaText><ParaText id="91126">Where is Canada going with this softwood lumber deal? It is larger than that, of course. Canada fundamentally is structurally altered with the free trade deal. Exports to the United States increased by 250%, and the U.S. now receives 87% of all Canadian exports.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91127">As Canada becomes more dependent upon U.S. markets, trade within Canada and the rest of the world has decreased. The result of the free trade deal has led to dependency. We are in a dependent position to a country that has 10 times the economic clout that we do. We put ourselves in a position of a mouse and we have shortened the chain to the elephant. What kind of life is that when we are so close to that big foot?</ParaText><ParaText id="91128">I have noticed one thing in the softwood lumber deal. It is the interference of the deal in federal-provincial and provincial to provincial relationships. All of a sudden we have the United States demanding that we treat our internal politics differently.</ParaText><ParaText id="91129">We have deals for the Maritimes. The Americans have given it an exemption. We have different deals for Quebec. We have different deals across the country. Therefore, we have a foreign power now telling us how to run our internal affairs. That to me is once again an abrogation of Canada's sovereignty, the sovereignty for which all our forefathers fought hard and that this government seems to treat with a great deal of disdain.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp><ParaText id="91130">The rights of Canadian citizens are being taken away in this deal. All of a sudden we have a deal that has numerous punitive clauses that go beyond most people's expectations when they go into business. Corporate directors are to be held liable for corporate debts due to the duties that are imposed under this deal, even for companies in bankruptcy.</ParaText><ParaText id="91131">Spouses and children are liable for the debts in the case of transferred properties. We are going to track them down to make sure they deliver this blood money over to the government.</ParaText><ParaText id="91132">Searches without warrants are authorized under clause 77 for records pertaining to payments and taxes. The authoritarian arm of the government will come down on these people who try to go away from this very special deal with the United States. Canada is basically giving up control of our country's resources to a foreign power.</ParaText><ParaText id="91133">When we think of it, this is a foreign power that is 10 times our size. When we focus on its finances and its manufacturing, the U.S. is a global power of immense and important distinction. What does Canada have in contrast? Canada is a country of 32 million people with a vast landscape of land and resources. Canada's strength is in what we do with those resources and how we position those resources for our children and our grandchildren.</ParaText><ParaText id="91134">When we sell out these resources, as we are doing here, we are doing irreparable harm to all those young children who want to grow up and live in their communities in regions of the country such as the northern and rural areas of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="91135">What are we doing? We are saying that this lumber is not for Canadians. We are saying that we will ship these logs down to the United States and these young Canadians can go and work in the cities. What we are doing here is giving up control.</ParaText><ParaText id="91136">I could talk about the energy deal that Canada signed under NAFTA but I will save that for another debate because there certainly should be a debate on our energy sector soon. If the government thinks that it can get away without talking about energy in this Parliament, without putting these things on the table, then it has another think coming when it comes to the NDP caucus.</ParaText><ParaText id="91137">Conservatives used to say that good fences make good neighbours. When they said that I liked Conservatives. I thought they were good guys. I thought they were there to protect us and take care of us. They have certainly fallen far away from that goal.</ParaText><ParaText id="91138">I have not had a chance to talk about the environment yet. To me the boreal forest of Canada is one of the last refuges of natural wilderness that we have in this country and it is being destroyed. What will this deal do to help that boreal forest? Zero. This agreement does not take the boreal forest into account at all. We are again abrogating our responsibilities to the environment. We are creating a situation, unlike northern Europe where they get 12 jobs for every one job that we get in the forest industry, Canada is going in the other direction with this deal. This is very sad.</ParaText><ParaText id="91139">I do not think I need to talk about jobs. We have heard it and we know what will happen. This is the deal that these people want for Canada.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We have a huge opportunity in Canada to develop the biomass energy industry and this could really help. The United States cannot stop us unless somewhere in this insidious deal the development of the biomass energy industry would be considered a subsidy to our people. I do not understand the deal well enough, but we are dealing with a powerful trade nation and it may have included some of those qualifications in the deal.</ParaText><ParaText id="91153"> I certainly would like to understand the deal better because it is something that needs to be explored.

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Szabo" id="1663415"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78477" Type="2">Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="91154">Mr. Speaker, I have listened to hours of debate on this ways and means motion relating to the so-called softwood lumber dispute. I have heard some very eloquent speeches from members all across the House, particularly those who have softwood industries in their ridings. They talked about the implications for their constituents and those businesses. We have heard stories about people who have gone bankrupt and people who have enormous loans and do not know whether they will have a future in the industry. </ParaText><ParaText id="91155">Those are devastating circumstances, which is why we are here debating the issue. However, we need to consider that this is not simply a debate about softwood lumber. This is, more important, a debate about the state of free trade between Canada and other countries.</ParaText><ParaText id="91156">When I first came to Parliament back in 1980, we were talking about trade deals. I remember going through the Mulroney years where free trade was the mantra. That was the future. Significant debate was held about whether or not we should enter into bilateral trade deals. As members know, we now have a variety of deals and they have been good for Canada.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91157">At that time, diplomatic and consul-type people were going back and forth to meeting after meeting, month after month, almost year after year. One of the items they talked about more than anything else was the dispute settlement mechanism. In other words, if there were a problem with a deal, would they be able to anticipate the substantive importance of it and the criteria under which they could deal with its resolution under a trade deal. We have not had a lot of discussion in the House on that but I think it is vital because this is not just about softwood. This is about softwood and every other trading relationship that we have. This is, in fact, an admission that the dispute settlement mechanism does not work.</ParaText><ParaText id="91158">Panel after panel of both NAFTA and the WTO have ruled that we are not subsidizing our softwood industry. During all the time the discussions were going on, we know that duties were being slapped on. I have heard a lot of numbers thrown around in the House but, just for ballpark purposes, we are talking about $5.4 billion of duties that have been withheld and charged to the industry.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91159">We are also faced with the unusual situation of the trade minister in the current government, who is responsible for this file, having been the minister responsible for this file in the previous government. We have some continuity here but we need to look at what the trade minister said to Parliament, to Canadians and to the industry. What he was saying was that we would fight this thing. He said that we were right under the NAFTA panels and under the WTO panels. He said that we would fight for the rights that we negotiated as part of the NAFTA. That is the essence of what he said but he sold our softwood industry to the Americans. </ParaText><ParaText id="91160">The softwood industry believed the minister and said that it would fight with the minister even if it meant going into debt to fight it in court. The federal government then said that it would give the industry loan guarantees and that it would stand with the softwood industry shoulder to shoulder to fight the Americans. </ParaText><ParaText id="91161">What happened? The government brought the industry to the brink and then the minister said that he had changed his mind because it was taking a long time. He claimed that fighting this was costing a lot of money. He also said that he was getting a lot of pressure from softwood lumber companies asking how they were supposed to manage their lives and operate their business on loan guarantees. They wanted to bring this issue to a head. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp><ParaText id="91162"> What happened? Parliament was virtually hijacked one day with, eureka, we have a deal. But the deal was not to get our $5.4 billion back. It was something else. It was “We are not going to worry about what the WTO and NAFTA said about the dispute and about their decisions on whether or not we were subsidizing. We are going to abandon everything we have done, all the strategy that was carried through and pushed into, we are just going to abandon all of that”.</ParaText><ParaText id="91163">The government sat down with the U.S. and basically said, “Let's cut a deal. This is not a win-win. We don't want to spend any more money in the courts. We want to bring this to a head. There is $5.4 billion on the table. How about if we give you $4 billion and we will call it square?” That is what happened.</ParaText><ParaText id="91164"><B>An hon. member:</B> It is $4.5 billion, Paul.</ParaText><ParaText id="91165"><B>Mr. Paul Szabo: </B> Mr. Speaker, the member will understand that if we are talking about the American document, it is in U.S. dollars, but if the member is telling me it is $4.5 billion in Canadian dollars converted, that is fine. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91166">Basically, for argument's sake, there is $1 billion left on the table. That $1 billion is not going where one would think it would go. In fact half of it, half a billion dollars is actually going to the U.S. lumber industry lobbyists who are going to use that half a billion dollars to fight us any other time something comes up in the future. Does that not give them an advantage? The U.S. softwood lumber industry all of a sudden is going to have $500 million to fight future disagreements that may come up.</ParaText><ParaText id="91167">The balance of the money that they are not going to give us back is basically going to George Bush and he will be able to do with it whatever he wants. He probably is going to invest the money in Iraq.</ParaText><ParaText id="91168">Why is it that the minister who has been the continuity on this entire file would take the industry down a road that he was not prepared to fight to the finish? He was not prepared to stand up for the softwood industry from the beginning to the end. He bailed out. That is why we call it a softwood sellout. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91169">I understand the industry has been shafted by the Conservative government, totally shafted. People in the industry are not getting all their money back and any money they get from this settlement is going to be turned over to the banks to repay the loans they had to take to go through this process that the minister sucked them into. That is what it turns out to be.</ParaText><ParaText id="91170">I have great sympathy for people in the softwood lumber industry. They cannot even count on the leadership of the government and particularly the minister to be with them. What did he do afterward? He came into the House and said, “Take the deal. If you don't take the deal, we are not with you any more”. It is like Allstate when someone has an accident, “Sorry, not with you any more”.</ParaText><ParaText id="91171">It led some in the industry into basic bankruptcy in many cases and now for the government to say, “We are not with you. If you decide to further pursue your legal options, do not even count on the Government of Canada to be by your side. Do not even count on the Government of Canada to be there to provide loan guarantees. As a matter of fact, we will look for other ways to make sure that your life is uncomfortable”.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91172">When the Conservative Government of Canada threatens the softwood industry, all I can say is shame on the government, shame on the government.</ParaText><ParaText id="91173">This is an issue of trade. Trade issues will arise. Maybe we have to reaffirm our commitment to free trade agreements and to the support of dispute resolution mechanisms that we will not abandon so that we do not give false hope to any industry which is caught in the same regard. </ParaText><ParaText id="91174">This is a short term deal. It is not going to provide security or stability for the industry for the long term. It is less than 24 months. On top of that, what does it mean in the future? Who is going to respect NAFTA in the future if they know all they have to do is spend more money?</ParaText>

I believe it does not understand how gravely it has hurt first nations, Inuit and Métis communities, directly and indirectly.</ParaText><ParaText id="91477">Over the spring and summer, we have seen the Conservatives' attitude toward Kelowna regress, from saying that they supported the accord, to “putting the wheels on” the accord, to finally denying that it ever existed.</ParaText><ParaText id="91478">Not only did the government mislead Canadians, it also misled the aboriginal people of Canada. Premiers across Canada were shocked by the government's betrayal. For example, the Premier of Saskatchewan and the leader of the official opposition voted unanimously in support of a motion urging the federal government to implement the agreement.</ParaText><ParaText id="91479"> First nation, Inuit and Métis leaders were stunned by the complete lack of consultation before the government chose not to honour the agreement. No one could believe the Conservative government would simply cut and run from its commitments. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91480">Perhaps the Conservatives like to tell themselves that the new consensus struck at Kelowna was nothing significant. To do so, however, ignores this landmark agreement and reinforces over 100 years of distrust and shame.</ParaText><ParaText id="91481">Kelowna is a high-water mark, one achieved through collaboration and good faith, aimed at reconciling the wrongs of the past.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91482">My elders tell me that in order to move forward, we must truly understand the past and the present to properly envision the future. We must understand the three phases of modern aboriginal-state relations. Every member in this House must be able to grasp these words before we are to truly understand what will be lost if the members of this House continue to vote against the Kelowna accord.</ParaText><ParaText id="91483">The first phase was an ad hoc/crisis phase. During this period of time from the 1950s until 1969, the federal government's approach to working with aboriginal people was with ad hoc responses to crises occurring in the communities. It was not until a crisis occurred that the government would respond. No medium, short or long term goals were ever taken. No constructive plans were ever enacted. This was simply and purely crisis management.</ParaText><ParaText id="91484">The second phase was an adversarial phase. The introduction of the 1969 white paper sparked aboriginal Canadians to respond strongly to its recommendations. Aboriginal people were tired of being swept under the rug and ignored until the last possible minute as they suffered misguided, imposed directives often disguised to assimilate the people and their lands.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91485">From the 1970s until the mid-1990s, aboriginal Canadians found their voice and explored many avenues to speak out and affirm their rights. We demanded that our rights be recognized, respected and protected. We succeeded.</ParaText><ParaText id="91486"> In the courts, we attained victories in Calder, Guerin, Baker Lake, Sparrow, Delgamuukw, Marshall, Powley, Haida, Mikisew and many others. First nations, Inuit and Métis rights were recognized and affirmed in section 35 of the Constitution. The United Nations also gave support to aboriginal Canadians, particularly in the case of Ms. Sandra Lovelace, who asserted her rights on the international stage and prevailed.</ParaText><ParaText id="91487">However, this was also a time of conflict, marked with protests, such as those at Oka, Ipperwash and others. Relationships were strained with increasing distrust and hostility. That had to end. We needed to move on and we did.</ParaText><ParaText id="91488">The relationship began to change in the mid-1990s. Canadian courts demanded that governments use political fora to address and deal with first nations, Inuit and Métis issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="91489">Self-government negotiations sprang up across the country, with an acceleration of programs being devolved to aboriginal control. Round tables were set up to deal with socio-economic issues. Real improvements in the lives of aboriginal people began to be made.</ParaText><ParaText id="91490">These were the three phases of aboriginal-state relations leading up to the Kelowna accord.</ParaText><ParaText id="91491">I also want to briefly make mention of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91492"> In 1996, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, RCAP, was concluded. RCAP emerged from the Oka crisis in 1990, with the then Progressive Conservative government realizing it could no longer ignore aboriginal people, something this government should take note of.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp><ParaText id="91493"> RCAP was incredibly ambitious in its vision and all-encompassing in its scope. Based on 177 days of hearings and 3,500 witnesses, a six volume, 5,000 page report could be boiled down to one key statement: that Canada can no longer allow aboriginal people to remain dependent upon the nation.</ParaText><ParaText id="91494">It laid out the history of how aboriginal people became dependent, of how their world became one of poverty and social upheaval. RCAP identified three characteristics of government action that led to this upheaval: first, the systematic denial of aboriginal peoples' nation status; second, the violation of most agreements made with aboriginal peoples; and third, the suppression of culture and institutions.</ParaText><ParaText id="91495">RCAP also made recommendations to overcome the incredibly challenging realities of dependency and poverty. In particular, it argued that substantial key investments be made with multi-year commitments. In time, those investments would pay for themselves, realizing net savings over the long term for the government. For example, RCAP recommended an immediate $3 billion investment in housing that would result in Canada recovering more than twice that amount over the next number of years. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91496">Poverty has become the reason for expense, but empowerment of the people and communities will be the way out. If the Kelowna accord is not honoured, this situation of empowerment and moving beyond dependency will not be reversed. Moreover, it is incredibly unsettling that the three key factors of oppression identified in RCAP, which I went through, namely, the denial of nation status, abandonment of agreements, and suppression of culture and institutions, are once again the government's agenda.</ParaText><ParaText id="91497">This minority government has a negative trend of undoing much of the progress made over the last 10 years. This relationship building stage is giving way to an adversarial stage once again. Yes, we are moving backwards with the Conservative government.</ParaText><ParaText id="91498">First, it has denied the nation status of aboriginal people. The UN declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples has been strongly opposed by the Conservatives, mostly on the basis that it would “revive 'extinguished' rights”, as if section 35 of the Constitution and many Supreme Court decisions did not exist.</ParaText><ParaText id="91499">Second, it has violated agreements. Most important, of course, it trashed the Kelowna accord over the objections of the first nations, Métis and Inuit peoples of this country.</ParaText><ParaText id="91500">Third, it has suppressed culture and institutions. This is what it is doing with the cuts to literacy and skills training, scrapping the first nations SchoolNet program and the court challenges program, and cutting off funding for band elections. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91501">I am not sure who the Conservative government purported to represent when it chose to kill the Kelowna accord. Everybody, and I mean everybody, wants the accord honoured. </ParaText><ParaText id="91502">The background or context of our choice is this. Let us look at some of the facts.</ParaText><ParaText id="91503">First, Canada is going through its most significant demographic shift in more than 50 years. Baby boomers are retiring while the aboriginal population is poised to enter the workforce in unprecedented numbers. The time to invest in education and post-secondary is now. At no other time has it been more important to support first nations, Inuit and Métis education.</ParaText><ParaText id="91504">Second, because of the baby boom occurring in the aboriginal community, we are experiencing overcrowded housing. It is not uncommon to see three families and up to 16 or so people living in one house. The Saskatoon <I>StarPhoenix</I> described in detail the results of this overcrowding on health, on education and on self-worth. </ParaText><ParaText id="91505">Black mould is killing the people of Black Lake in my riding and many other communities across Canada. An elder passed away literally having black mould growing in her lungs. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91506">Tuberculosis is rampant in my riding. I urge members to read the article in the <I>StarPhoenix</I> of September 26 and see a woman, a wife, a mother, lying in a coma from the complications of tuberculosis. Her husband and family are devastated. My daughter, Taylor, had to live with TB medication for a year. The government has ignored the TB outbreak in Black Lake like it has ignored the TB outbreak in Garden Hill. How can kids study or do homework in these conditions?</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp><ParaText id="91507">The <I>StarPhoenix</I> editorial board called this a “public health horror”. The Regina <I>Leader-Post</I> editorial board called it “a national disgrace”. And the government is going to tell me that it is not going to vote in favour of solving these issues. I hope government members can sleep at night. </ParaText><ParaText id="91508">A key reason why the Kelowna accord is so crucially important is that it provides the means to empower aboriginal communities to respond to the facts I have just laid out for members. If the Conservatives do nothing, not only will opportunity be lost but another generation will be lost to dependency and poverty. This must not and cannot happen.</ParaText><ParaText id="91509">The Kelowna accord represents, in the context of this speech, two things: first, the progress of the aboriginal people, the progress that they have made to improve the lives of their people, to have government recognize their rights, and to ultimately take their rightful place in Canadian society. Of course, these struggles are best described in the three phases I spoke of earlier.</ParaText><ParaText id="91510">Second, we need to begin to see the recommendations made in RCAP in 1996 implemented. This report was widely supported by aboriginal leaders across the country as a report which began to finally recognize our struggles, but also provided solutions for consideration.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91511">Therefore, the Kelowna accord represents hope for first nations, Métis and Inuit people, and prosperity for Canada. It is a high watermark in aboriginal state relations, clearly leading toward implementing the nation to nation relationship necessary to resolve longstanding conflicts related to the numerous issues that could only be addressed through an improved legislated relationship recognizing the jurisdictions of each party.</ParaText><ParaText id="91512">It represents a new consensus in which all parties at the table agreed to jointly work toward resolving, issues such as housing, health, economic development and more. For the first time, Métis, Inuit and first nations people would be allowed at the table to set the agenda, the objectives, and the action plans to address social justice issues which have for too long been rampant in our communities. Finally, the cost of doing nothing was clearly understood, or so we thought. </ParaText><ParaText id="91513">Enter the Conservative minority government. How things have changed for the worse. Aboriginal people were betrayed as the Kelowna accord was killed without a second thought. Let us look at this novice Conservative government performance over the last eight months.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91514">Of course, the Kelowna accord was not honoured. The government barely respected the residential school agreement, as I am sure there were some detailed discussions against this in cabinet. It refused to sign onto the UN declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples. The government was able to convince one country to side with it after unsuccessfully trying to convince others with horrendous human rights violations against indigenous peoples in their countries.</ParaText><ParaText id="91515">The government dragged its feet on responding to the Caledonia land dispute. It undermined the Dehcho nations negotiations on the Mackenzie pipeline and I know there is more to come.</ParaText><ParaText id="91516">Why do I say this? Let us look at some of the trends emerging on the government side. Let us list them. </ParaText><ParaText id="91517">Trend no. 1, there is no consultation with aboriginal people. There was no consultation on a decision to kill the Kelowna accord, no consultation on Bill <Document DbId="2158135" Type="3">C-2</Document>, no consultation on the UN declaration, and no consultation on the water or limited consultation on the water quality panel it set up. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91518">There was no consultation on land claim issues, no consultation and no role for aboriginal people on the ministerial advisory committee on child care spaces initiative, and no consultation on the post-secondary review process which, coincidentally, the AUCC does not feel is fair consultation anyway. </ParaText><ParaText id="91519">There was no consultation on cutting the aboriginal procurement strategy, no consultation on cuts to education capital, and no consultation on cutting funding to Ontario first nations elections. And of course, there was no consultation on the federal budget of 2006-07.</ParaText><ParaText id="91520">Overall, this Conservative government just does not care enough to consult with aboriginal people. Aboriginal people are getting the message that the government does not want to talk to them.</ParaText><ParaText id="91521">Trend no. 2, there is a diminishing of aboriginal rights. One of the principles of the UN declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples is the recognition of collective rights. In fact, the <Affiliation DbId="78767" Type="4">Minister of Indian Affairs</Affiliation> stated in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> that “the text (in the declaration) could be used to revive rights that were lawfully extinguished or ceded by treaty.”</ParaText><ParaText id="91522">What rights were extinguished lawfully? This is the basis upon which aboriginal people have battled the government for decades. Aboriginal people were swindled and prevented from defending themselves. In fact, many first nations people could not even hire a lawyer to act on their behalf. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp><ParaText id="91523">This tells the aboriginal people that the minister is not open to discussing aboriginal rights in a fair and reasonable manner, especially it seems, collective rights. I think there is a reason to why collective rights are being targeted.</ParaText><ParaText id="91524">The <Affiliation DbId="78767" Type="4">Minister of Indian Affairs</Affiliation> was quoted as saying in a Saskatchewan newspaper that fee simple land ownership is the only solution to dealing with aboriginal poverty. This is an entirely American policy. In the United States the Dawes act of 1887 stole Indian land from the Indian people on the premise of eliminating poverty.</ParaText><ParaText id="91525">In the book, <I>Reconciliation: First Nations Treaty Making in British Columbia</I>, Mr. Penikett, who is a well-respected authority on aboriginal rights, writes a passage that states:</ParaText><ParaText id="91526"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Theodore Roosevelt praised the Dawes Act as “a mighty pulverizing engine to break up the tribal mass”. Through foreclosures and state tax collections, settlers soon grabbed all the best land. In less than a lifetime, Indians had lost half of their remaining lands in the United States.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="91527">Will this future Conservative government on reserve private land ownership legislation be known as the member for <Affiliation DbId="78874" Type="2">Calgary Centre-North</Affiliation> act? </ParaText><ParaText id="91528">The minister's comments tell the first nations of Canada that the goal of the government is clearly not to respect their collective rights but to open up reserve lands for speculators. But, it does not end there. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91529">The next issue the government is dressed in sheep's clothing on is matrimonial real property. Clearly, first nations women are not fairly or legally protected when it comes to the Indian Act. It is a very discriminatory piece of legislation that must be eliminated. In June 1992, Ms. Nellie Carlson of the group Indian Rights for Indian Women said:</ParaText><ParaText id="91530"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Historically the Indian Act has thoroughly brainwashed us. Since 1869 Indian women already were legislated as to who she should be. Six times the Indian Act changed on Indian women. But each time she lost a little bit of her rights as an Indian.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="91531">To resolve this issue requires a very complex set of negotiations to take place. The respect and recognition of the first nations dispute resolution processes is necessary. The membership rules of the Indian Act, and specifically the Bill C-31 amendments must be changed to further protect the rights of first nations women.</ParaText><ParaText id="91532">Socio-economic conditions must be addressed. Recognition of women's rights within the communal land ownership context must be addressed effectively. If it is the plan of the Conservative government to establish fee simple land ownership in order to divide up matrimonial property upon dissolution of marriage, it will not work. If this is the plan, first nations women may end up losing more of their rights as Ms. Nellie Carlson described.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91533">The move of the Conservative government is clearly to establish fee simple land ownership through any means possible, recognizing of course what the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> did recently when he stood proud to denounce the rights of the aboriginal people of this country as race-based.</ParaText><ParaText id="91534">Aboriginal people have fought hard to have their rights recognized through the avenues available to them in this democratic country.

This has been a long outstanding issue, an issue that has unfortunately been in place for well over a century. There is no question that the government is taking action. The minister, within a very short period of becoming the minister, has engaged this very important file. </ParaText><ParaText id="91573">Today I am very proud to say that we will be moving forward, we will be finding developing legislation after the consultative process, and very soon we will have this issue resolved.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91574">Today my hon. colleague, with whom I have the pleasure of sitting on the aboriginal affairs committee, is raising the issue, which he seems to often do, about what our government is doing in relation to the so-called Kelowna accord. As was already mentioned by my colleague from the government's side, who also sits on the committee, “accord” is really the wrong word to use. The word “accord” has an element to it which one would think requires signatures. When I asked the former prime minister this very question, he was unable to state that there were signatures associated with this so-called accord. Unfortunately, it was a promissory press release, and the former government did not follow through on many of its promises.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91575"> We can look back to the early parts of its administration in relation to cutting the GST, one of the most infamous promises of the former government. In fact, one of its ministers had to resign over that. It also wanted to kill the free trade agreement. Obviously that government enjoyed having the free trade agreement and all the benefits it brought to our great nation. There is no question that we had record surpluses throughout the nineties. The Liberals would say that it was due to them, but as an entrepreneur, it was due to the hard-working business people and all the employees who paid those taxes.</ParaText><ParaText id="91576">Today I will talk a bit though about what our government is doing for aboriginal people. I spoke already about the great announcement we made today on matrimonial real property. However, I would like to look back to the spring when we spoke of major increases in our budget for aboriginal affairs. We are spending considerable dollars in the areas of housing. We have the long outstanding residential schools settlement of $2.2 billion. Our government is moving forward.</ParaText><ParaText id="91577">Structural reform, unfortunately, is something that was completely left out of the first ministers meeting of last year. In my travels throughout the country, I met with many aboriginal people, first nations, Inuit and Métis, but first nations specifically, because they are under the thumb of the terrible Indian Act, this pre-Confederation document. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91578">First nation citizens have called for structural reform. They want to see a new system through which benefits actually flow to the people who need it most. Unfortunately, this was not addressed by the first ministers meeting. It was not addressed by the former government. The new minister has said that structural change and reform is one of his key pillars, and I am very much looking forward to being a part of those discussions.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp><ParaText id="91579">As we look at the first ministers meeting last fall, we do have a deeper and shared understanding of the challenges and needs faced by aboriginal people in areas such as health, water, housing, education and economic opportunities. </ParaText><ParaText id="91580">The first ministers meeting brought the parties together, federal-provincial-territorial and aboriginals, for discussions to clarify priorities and shared responsibilities. The process and discussions actually began much earlier, but, as several aboriginal groups have pointed out, they were not perfect. In fact, some groups found out about the meeting literally the week before. Nevertheless, they were a significant step forward in terms of consultation and consensus building, one of the three elements that the Auditor General identified as essential to improving the lives of aboriginal people. </ParaText><ParaText id="91581">Last fall's meeting, however, did not go so far as to culminate in an actual accord, outlining focused and immediate initiatives. Nor did it adequately address two other elements that the Auditor General had highlighted as key to further progress: structural change and capacity building, which I have already mentioned. After 13 years of Liberal governments, little or nothing has been done on this front, and I am not surprised.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91582">As was noted earlier, structural changes are difficult. What has not been emphasized is that they are nonetheless very necessary. In many cases they are needed simultaneous, if not prior, to further investment. This will ensure that current and future investments have measurable results, which someone is accountable for and producing.</ParaText><ParaText id="91583">Our new Conservative government is committed not only to conserving and building on the good consultation and consensus work done at the first ministers meeting. We are not only committed to investing additional funds when they will be most effectively expended. We are not only committed to increasing capacity. We are also committed to making the difficult structural changes that the Liberals so long neglected at significant cost to all Canadians, especially aboriginal Canadians. We are committed to accountability, another area in relation to which the Liberals have had to scramble to prepare statements of defence. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91584">Given that we fully support the objectives and targets identified last fall, there is little the Liberals can do except try to pass off a press release, with a Liberal pre-election spending promise attached to it, as a legally binding Government of Canada commitment. The Liberals may publicly attack five months of Conservative action, now eight, because it does not fulfill one day of pre-election Liberal promises. Will they ever publicly admit, however, that today's debate is all about deflecting attention from the fact that five months, now eight months, of Conservative action has brought more new funding and initiatives on key aboriginal issues than 13 years of Liberal inaction? These 13 years have given the Liberals a record that even their potential future leader, Gerard Kennedy, has recently called “devastating”. </ParaText><ParaText id="91585">As another hon. colleague from Winnipeg Centre pointed out earlier this year, the Liberals, after 13 years of power, had become skilled in announcing program funding spread over so many years, which it had little significant impact, and re-announcing the programs year after year. This did nothing to aid in the plight of aboriginal people. This will not be the new Conservative government's approach. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91586">What is required now is a plan of action, a means to move forward, a plan that will evolve, as needed, specific consultations, as we have done today. We announced a major consultation with aboriginal women's groups across Canada. I am speaking about our plans for matrimonial property. However, we need structural change, capacity building and additional funding, a plan that will prove and produce tangible, measurable results and one that will have details of the concrete steps we need to take in order to implement the plan. Furthermore, the plan must be prioritized, focused and resourced, with clear responsibilities and accountabilities. We are taking that swift action.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp><ParaText id="91587">In March of this year, one of this government's first acts was to launch a plan to address drinking water concerns in first nations communities. This was a terrible blight that was left upon the Government of Canada, a situation that was left at our feet by the previous administration, but we set this as a priority. The minister wanted to personally deal with the situation so he immediately put together a plan to remediate the situation.</ParaText><ParaText id="91588">This government understands the critical importance water is to improving the quality of life for aboriginal women, children and families. We recognize that providing opportunities for these women and their families builds economic strength and capacity from inside their communities, which means that aboriginal people will become more prosperous in their own right with their own source revenues, which they are so desperately striving for. We as a country want to assist them on that front. We feel that providing matrimonial real property to on reserve women who hold families together will be an excellent foundation from which economic development and economic prosperity will grow.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91589">Looking back at our budget earlier this year, we allocated $3.7 billion for aboriginal and northern programs. This amount of money dwarfs the previous budgets of the entire 13 years in this area. This also includes the $2.2 billion that was put in place to address the legacy of Indian residential schools, a dark chapter in our history but we have moved forward. We put that money in the budget and we are very proud of the fact that cheques are now being sent out to some of the claimants in advance of the process being fully in place. We took that action because we knew that some of these claimants were rather older in their term of being involved in this process and, thankfully, our government has streamlined this process.</ParaText><ParaText id="91590">The budget targeted investments for aboriginal Canadians in other key areas. These investments included $300 million for affordable housing programs in the territories, benefiting both aboriginal and non-aboriginal peoples. Being a northerner myself, originally from the north, I can tell members that these housing dollars will be greatly appreciated as the cost of living in the north is considerably higher than here in the south, as is the cost of building a house.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91591">Nunavut is where the problem is most pressing. I had the pleasure of travelling to Nunavut on my first trip in my capacity as parliamentary secretary. I enjoyed visiting the people of Nunavut and I saw firsthand that the need there is most pressing. That government will be receiving $200 million in order to deal with this major issue. The other territories, as well, are receiving a considerable amount for the important issue of housing.</ParaText><ParaText id="91592">However, many aboriginals in Canada live off reserve so we put $300 million into housing in those areas, as we see more aboriginal people moving from the reserve to urban centres. Sometimes they feel that is the right approach to find the economic means to look after their families. We have seen that and we are taking action.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp><ParaText id="91593">We have also set aside $450 million for key initiatives, such as education, something that the minister is very serious about. In fact, he feels that education is the key to children's future and the futures of aboriginal youth. Part of the money has been set aside for children and families to make a better community on reserve, as well as for on reserve water, which we dealt with immediately upon taking office. In fact, the minister had barely dusted off the desk in his new office when he had already begun working on that issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="91594">Of the $3.7 billion earmarked for aboriginal and northern Canadians, we have a $500 million socio-economic fund that will be essential to community development in the north in areas that will be potentially impacted by the Mackenzie Valley pipeline project. This will be an incredible fund to bring about own source revenues for so many communities that are interested in finding business opportunities in the north and to operate on funds that they generate themselves. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91595">Many aboriginal communities are not interested in seeing the government be the sole funder of life within their communities. They are looking for economic opportunities. This is a message that all too often was not heard by the previous government. However, as someone who comes from the private sector and who is an aboriginal Canadian, I know many aboriginal entrepreneurs who are proud of the fact that they are very successful within the business sector. I know this same type of entrepreneurialism will be found in the north, especially in the Mackenzie Valley delta.</ParaText><ParaText id="91596">This government has pledged to make progress toward its goal of working with first nations, Inuit and Métis partners and with the provinces and territories to establish priorities and develop effective sustainable approaches to the social and economic challenges they face in their communities. </ParaText><ParaText id="91597">We are delivering real results, not just empty rhetoric. Canadians voted for change and we are delivering to them positive change. We are committed to bettering the lives of aboriginal people in Canada through a practical and decisive approach and the steps we have taken so far clearly show this.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

In fact, I have been hearing Conservative members suggest today that there never was an accord. I would like to quote from a letter that their <Affiliation DbId="79007" Type="96">Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and Federal Interlocutor for Métis and Non-Status Indians</Affiliation> wrote to the chair of the committee. Here is what he wrote on the second page of his letter: </ParaText><ParaText id="91627"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The time has come to build on what was decided on November 2005—</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="91628">The minister himself confirms in his letter that decisions were made in 2005. Today, we are told that there is no text, no accord, but that decisions were made.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91629">It is typical of the Conservative Party to talk a great deal but do nothing. Earlier, the parliamentary secretary provided proof of this. The Conservatives consult, they travel, they visit, but they do not accomplish anything. They probably picked up this habit from the Liberal Party, which did that for a long time. Maybe one day, after listening to and understanding the Bloc Québécois members, they will manage to do some good things.</ParaText><ParaText id="91630">Speaking of good things, our Bloc Québécois Indian and northern affairs critic, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78785" Type="2">Abitibi—Témiscamingue</Affiliation>, introduced the motion we are discussing today. This motion became a report that was tabled by our colleague on May 8, 2006. The motion recalls that, once again, Ottawa has not kept its promises and lived up to its responsibilities to Canada's aboriginal peoples.</ParaText><ParaText id="91631">The motion that led to the report today reads as follows:</ParaText><ParaText id="91632"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That, pursuant to Standing Order 108(2), the Committee recommends that the government implement the Kelowna agreement, entitled Strengthening Relationships and Closing the Gap, which was reached on November 25, 2005 between the First Ministers and the National Aboriginal Leaders. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91633">When we talk about the Kelowna agreement, we have to understand something. The provincial premiers were there, as were aboriginal representatives and federal government representatives. Consequently, the Kelowna meeting was far more important than the Conservative government is trying to imply.</ParaText><ParaText id="91634">The third paragraph of the report reads as follows:</ParaText><ParaText id="91635"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That the Committee adopt these recommendations as a report to the House and that the Chair present this report to the House. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="91636">This is what we are discussing today.</ParaText><ParaText id="91637">We must not kid ourselves, though. The Kelowna agreement is just a temporary measure that will do nothing to improve aboriginal peoples' living conditions in the long run. It is a good start. That is what the Bloc Québécois means to say. It helps to close the growing gap between the quality of life of aboriginal peoples and that of Quebeckers and Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="91638">The agreement represented $5.1 billion over five years for aboriginal education, health, housing and economic opportunities.</ParaText><ParaText id="91639">Considering that the $5.1 billion is shared by the federal government, Quebec, the provinces and territories and the aboriginal administration before it reaches the first nations, Inuit and Métis, where the need is, this is very little money to use to really close that gap.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91640">The need is critical—as I was saying earlier—in housing alone for the first nations of Quebec. The immediate, known, calculated, negotiated and discussed need is over $700 million to provide the roughly 7,000 housing units that are lacking. I am glad to hear the parliamentary secretary say that aboriginals are doing well. I told him as much. In my riding, aboriginals are doing very well, just as non-aboriginals are. There are many successes, but there are also many pockets of poverty. Obviously resolving the social housing problem helps eliminate the pockets of poverty.</ParaText><ParaText id="91641">In Quebec, we need $700 million for 7,000 housing units. The shortfall gets bigger every year. If this problem is not resolved, the gap will widen further and the 7,000 units we need now will become 8,000 units in a few years' time.</ParaText><ParaText id="91642">As we know, this lack of housing has extremely dire human and social consequences. Health issues are closely linked to the lack of housing. It is high time to stop the increase in the number of cases of poisoning, infection, tuberculosis and so on. It is also worrying to see the incidence of diabetes, fetal alcoholism and suicide.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp><ParaText id="91643">Suicide is a serious problem, although it should be noted that the rates vary considerably from one community to another. Nonetheless, the overall rate is much too high. Knowing that the suicide rate is five to seven times greater among first nations youth than among non-aboriginal youth, and that the suicide rate among Inuit youth is among the highest in the world, some 11 times higher than the Canadian average, it is urgent to invest time and money. There is no need for consultations since everyone knows these statistics. It is high time to devote resources to dealing with the increased rate of suicide.</ParaText><ParaText id="91644">As far as education is concerned, if the government ever decided to address the problem, it would take 27 to 28 years to narrow the gap between aboriginals and other Quebeckers and Canadians, according to the Auditor General's 2004 report. That is saying something.</ParaText><ParaText id="91645">The Auditor General told us that the gap between Quebeckers, Canadians and aboriginal peoples is 27 to 28 years if it is to be addressed based on federal government spending in 2004. That is why the Kelowna accord was important, but, once again, the Conservative Party has decided to continue to hold consultations. The gap will widen as the Conservatives consult. Apparently this has become the Conservatives' magic recipe: travel and consult.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91646">The multiple reports of the Auditor General, the observations of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples and, more recently, the last report of the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, namely on living conditions of aboriginal peoples in Canada, sound the alarm. The United Nations published a report on the living conditions of aboriginal peoples in Canada and the situation is considered alarming. This is not something we can deny. Reports have been written about it. The Conservatives tell us more consultations are needed. Yet the United Nations produced a report on the living conditions of aboriginal peoples in Canada. I do not understand why we are not taking action, unless it is because we want to save even more money at the expense of the poor. That is the reality, that is what is happening. For the past two weeks we have watched the Conservative party play politics at the expense of those most in need. It goes looking for money, makes cuts to programs and that is what is being done to aboriginal peoples. We carry on, no investments are made, the money promised at Kelowna is not forthcoming and, obviously, savings are had. But for what? We shall see some day. They will probably use it to help their friends. They are going to catch the Liberal sickness.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91647">Aboriginal peoples have already presented to Ottawa this study by the United Nations as well as their own. But Ottawa has always turned a deaf ear.</ParaText><ParaText id="91648">On the eve of the first ministers' conference, the Bloc Québécois publicly supported the shared position of the Assembly of First Nations of Quebec and Labrador and Quebec Native Women, who rejected the government's actions. Aboriginal peoples have already conducted their own analysis of the situation under the auspices of the Assembly of First Nations.</ParaText><ParaText id="91649">Quebec Native Women has already carried out its own study. The Assembly of First Nations of Quebec and Quebec Native Women deplored the fact that the approach used to diminish the gap between living conditions of aboriginal peoples and those of Quebeckers and Canadians would not tackle the root causes of the first nations' plight, that is the absence of equitable access to land and resources as well as respect for their rights. </ParaText><ParaText id="91650">Earlier today the parliamentary secretary announced some trifling measures, but the real problems are not being addressed.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91651">Aboriginals, first nations and Quebec Native Women are telling us plainly that there is no equitable access to lands and resources, and no respect for their rights. The Assembly of First Nations of Quebec and Labrador and Quebec Native Women also deplore the fact that the Kelowna objective's pan-aboriginal approach and lack of community consultations to target the real issues would perpetuate the first nations' cycle of dependency. </ParaText><ParaText id="91652">The Bloc Québécois believes we need concrete solutions that are in tune with all of the different aboriginal nations and that go to the root of the inequalities that affect their communities. Furthermore, these measures must be decided in concert with aboriginal nations because money alone cannot solve these problems.</ParaText><ParaText id="91653">The Bloc Québécois believes that an agreement was reached in Kelowna, and that there was $5.1 billion on the table. Great—that is a start. Now we are ready. Let us sit down with the first nations, with the aboriginal peoples, and find solutions to their problems. Aboriginal communities are not all the same. We cannot approach this from a pan-aboriginal perspective. We have to sit down and talk about it. However, we should not go about it like the Conservative Party, which talks a lot but does not put up the cash. They will talk and talk, they will beat around the bush, then eventually they will come up with some money, but the problem will go on. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91654">In the end, ten years will have passed and the problem will have gotten worse: more housing units will be needed; health problems will not have been resolved, but will have worsened; and furthermore, the education gap will not have been bridged. It is estimated it will take 30 to 35 years to bridge the education gap. All of this because the Conservative party decided to save money in the short term at great cost to our most vulnerable citizens, aboriginals.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp><ParaText id="91655">We know in this House that commitments to aboriginal Canadians—particularly concerning housing, infrastructure, education and health care—are federal jurisdictions. </ParaText><ParaText id="91656">I do not believe this will be questioned. As the Bloc Québécois has always maintained, Ottawa must not default on its fiduciary obligations. It must be understood that this is a federal jurisdiction. All too often, this House hears criticism about federal attempts to take over provincial jurisdictions.</ParaText><ParaText id="91657">Here is a striking example: our <Affiliation DbId="79001" Type="96">Minister of Labour and Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec</Affiliation> wanted to create a Marshall plan in an area of jurisdiction that, once again, is not federal. Regional economic development is a provincial jurisdiction.</ParaText><ParaText id="91658">The federal government has the fiduciary responsibility for any problems facing aboriginal peoples, yet it is not resolving those problems. They do not want to spend any money, yet they want to create programs.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91659">The <Affiliation DbId="79001" Type="96">Minister of Labour and Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec</Affiliation> wanted to create a vast Marshall plan to provide assistance to all areas of Quebec. He finally coughed up a mouse this week: $85 million over three years. Moreover, this money is recycled from other programs, money that was not already spent. Once again, this is not a federal jurisdiction.</ParaText><ParaText id="91660">Some would argue that the Supreme Court said that the federal government has the spending power and can therefore spend its money however it likes. This is true. It has the power to do so. The Supreme Court granted that power. However, the Constitution says that regional development is a provincial jurisdiction. That is the reality.</ParaText><ParaText id="91661">Thus, they are not minding their own business. They are not resolving aboriginal peoples' problems, or a number of others. Rather, they are trying to invest or gain visibility in areas that are not federal jurisdictions.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91662">The Conservative government's approach to managing aboriginal issues is not very reassuring. For example, a plan to guarantee safe drinking water in first nations communities is commendable in and of itself. The idea is a good one. However, there is cause for concern when the initiative excludes the communities in the greatest need, those with no drinking water system that still bring water in. The plan targeted communities that had drinking water systems, but there was no money for those that did not. That shows how the Conservatives are managing this issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="91663">Moreover, the plan to ensure safe drinking water explains that:</ParaText><ParaText id="91664"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">First Nations are responsible for the construction, design, operation and maintenance of their water systems. INAC provides funding to First Nations for these activities, subject to the appropriate technical review and funding approval process. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91665">With this initiative, the Conservative government is telling communities that not only is no new money being committed to implement the plan, but communities in the greatest need could lose their funding if they fail the INAC approval process. This is totally unacceptable. It shows a lack of trust in our aboriginal peoples. The government is setting up an inspection system that they might spend money on, but that does not mean that the government is going to pay them. It is not paying anything up front; work is done, but then is inspected, and there is no guarantee that the money will be paid out in the end.</ParaText><ParaText id="91666">The first budget the Conservatives brought down is also indicative of the new approach of this so-called new government. Aboriginal communities have critical socioeconomic problems. The situation is untenable in some cases. The Bloc Québécois does not believe that the $450 million over two years that has been announced will be enough to respond appropriately.</ParaText><ParaText id="91667">We must not forget that the Kelowna agreement provided for $5.1 billion over five years. This is nowhere near that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91668">I said it earlier, and I will quote from the minister's letter again, because it is really something to hear what the Conservatives are saying today: the minister writes to the committee chair that “The time has come to build on what was decided in November 2005—”. That was it. He figures that decisions were made. One of those decisions was to invest $5.1 billion, but the money is not there. When the time comes to talk money and to help those in our society who are most in need, the Conservatives consult, travel, visit, listen and take so long to do anything that the issue will never be addressed. </ParaText><ParaText id="91669">In its search for a new and better approach to managing aboriginal issues, the Conservative government should start with the findings of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. The commission, which cost $58 million, was set up when the Conservatives were in power and was paid for with Quebec and Canadian taxpayers' dollars, but since the report was released, its conclusions have been completely ignored.</ParaText><ParaText id="91670">The government wants to hold a new round of consultations. Yet the Conservatives have already paid for consultations: the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. The commission's report is not being used. Like other reports, it is gathering dust.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp><ParaText id="91671">This enables us to travel, visit first nations, find out just how bad their situation is and bemoan their plight. Unfortunately, nothing gets resolved and no money is forthcoming despite a Conservative-mandated royal commission that cost $58 million and produced a report the Liberals chose to ignore. </ParaText><ParaText id="91672">One might have thought the Conservatives would have gone back to the royal commission's conclusions and would have tried to apply them, rather than consulting, visiting and travelling.</ParaText><ParaText id="91673">The Bloc Québécois supports the report—that is what I have been saying all along. Among other things, we support the implementation of the Kelowna accord. The commitments the federal government made in Kelowna are the first step toward bridging the gap between aboriginals and Quebeckers and Canadians. However, the Bloc Québécois finds that the underlying causes of these inequalities have not yet been corrected.</ParaText><ParaText id="91674">Aboriginals must be given all of the tools they need to direct the development of their own identity: the right to self-government and recognition of their rights. The Bloc Québécois has always supported this. Furthermore, we demand that the funds promised during the Kelowna conference be delivered.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91675">We were open to having a discussion at this conference. When we agreed on the $7.1 billion, we realized that there would be discussions with aboriginal peoples to ensure that the funds would not be uniformly distributed in standardized programs. We were aware that we would have to take action based on needs. At least we had an agreement on the amount of money.</ParaText><ParaText id="91676">I would like to state once again that Kelowna is not the only issue that the Conservatives are not interested in addressing. As I mentioned earlier, when I read the minister's letter, he stated that conclusions were arrived at and decisions made at Kelowna. However, the Conservatives do not believe in making monetary investments. We witnessed it this week: when the time comes to help those most in need and the weakest in our society, the Conservative party stands aside; it prefers to give money to the rich, not the poor.</ParaText><ParaText id="91677">With regard to future relations between the government and aboriginal peoples, we recommend a more comprehensive approach, one that recognizes the aspirations of aboriginal peoples and one that favours negotiating agreements nation to nation.</ParaText><ParaText id="91678">The Bloc Québécois believes that Quebec is a nation, that the aboriginal peoples are nations and that Canada is a nation on an equal footing with the others, and that these nations must negotiate with one another in order to arrive at agreements and real solutions.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91679">I also wish to point out in this House that we agree entirely with the idea of the right to self-government of aboriginal peoples. In more general terms, we identify with the aboriginal peoples' claims for autonomy; we recognize aboriginal peoples as distinct peoples with the right to their own culture, language, customs and traditions as well as the right to direct the development of their own identity.</ParaText><ParaText id="91680">In closing, I remind you that the Bloc Québécois endorsed the main recommendations of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples and the Erasmus-Dussault report. This commission set out an approach for self-government based on recognition of aboriginal governments as a level of government with authority over issues of good governance and the well-being of their people. The entire report is based on recognition of the aboriginal peoples as self-governing nations occupying a unique place in Canada.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

In June 2002 the former Liberal minister of justice, Martin Cauchon, announced that tough new legislation protecting children from sexual exploitation, Internet luring and child pornography received royal assent.</ParaText><ParaText id="91693">The new law fulfilled a commitment made in the 2001 Speech from the Throne. The legislation also met with commitments undertaken by the federal, provincial and territorial ministers of justice at their meeting in September 2000 to create a new offence of Internet luring. In these discussions, the penalty for this offence would have been discussed and a consensus would have been reached.</ParaText><ParaText id="91694">In the justice committee's deliberations on this new section of the Criminal Code, I was impressed with the presentation of a report on child exploitation and the Internet submitted by the Canadian Resource Centre for the Victims of Crime, and I wish to reference some of the information provided.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91695">The Internet has made the world a smaller place. It has also made it more dangerous for our children. While we encourage our children to take advantage of the benefits of the net as a wonderful tool for education and obtaining information, we must also ensure that they are aware of the dangers and that we take the necessary steps to protect them. There is a dark side to the Internet.</ParaText><ParaText id="91696">Chat rooms have opened up our homes to virtual strangers who can pretend to be anyone, any age and either sex. They can talk to children in complete secrecy. They can prey on a child as the child's parents sit in the very next room. They can entice a child to meet in person, where the risk of sexual abuse becomes imminent, and they do. Pedophiles who used to be isolated can now find victims without leaving the security of their own homes, at little expense and reduced risk of being caught.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91697">Millions of children are online in their own homes, in public libraries, schools, or at a friend's house. Children who come home from school to an empty house may turn to the Internet as much as they used to turn to television. They may not feel any threat by talking to someone online, especially when they believe it is a child like themselves. After a few weeks or months of communication, they are not strangers any more and that new-found friend is actually a sexual predator ready to claim another unsuspecting victim.</ParaText><ParaText id="91698">The Internet does not respect any global boundaries. This makes it difficult to police. Experienced users were operating with virtual anonymity, although law enforcement in some parts of the world are struggling to catch up. Countries like Canada have recognized this new form of child sexual exploitation and have begun to dedicate the necessary resources and attention to this growing problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="91699">The protection of children has always been a priority for Canadians as well. As more and more Canadians recognize the value of the Internet and get online in their homes, the risks to their children increase as online predators go searching for new victims. There is an acknowledgement, both inside and outside Canada, that we need a coordinated law enforcement to deal with this problem.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91700">Pedophiles may use the Internet for a variety of reasons, including validation through communication with like-minded people, to find potential victims and to trade child pornography. Pedophiles who use the Internet to search new victims may be the predatory type who have above average intelligence and have the economic means to operate the Internet, as was referenced in the publication “Use of Computers in the Sexual Exploitation of Children”.</ParaText><ParaText id="91701">Some online services and Internet service providers allow parents to limit access by their children to certain services and features, such as adult oriented websites, chat rooms and bulletin boards. In addition, there are filtering features built into the popular Internet browsers that empower parents to limit their children's access only to those sites that have been rated appropriate for children. Other useful tools are software programs that block websites, newsgroups and chat areas that are known to be inappropriate for children.</ParaText><ParaText id="91702">Most of these programs can be configured by the parent to filter out sites that contain nudity, sexual content, hateful or violent material, or that advocate the use of drugs, tobacco or alcohol. Some can also be configured to prevent children from revealing information about themselves, such as their name, address or telephone number. They help, but they are not foolproof.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91703">Children benefit from being online, but can also be targets of crime and exploitation in this as in any other environment. Just like there are good and bad people in schools, parks and our homes, there are good and bad people on the net.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp><ParaText id="91704">The fact that crimes are being committed online, however, is not a reason to avoid using these services. To tell children to stop using these services would be like telling parents not to send their kids to school because of some high profile cases of teachers preying on their students. Parents need to instruct children about both the benefits and dangers of cyberspace, and how to protect themselves.</ParaText><ParaText id="91705">We all have a stake in protecting our children. Governments, Internet service providers, educators and others should focus resources and efforts into educating children and parents about the dangers that the Internet presents. </ParaText><ParaText id="91706">There are over 100 million Internet users around the globe. The overwhelming majority are people who use the net for work, research or to communicate with family and friends. Even if cyberstalkers and predators represent only a small percentage of users, we are still talking about a significant number of offenders and even more potential victims. </ParaText><ParaText id="91707">The complexity of the Internet means that solutions are equally complex. The net is truly international and laws about crime committed against children, in particular child pornography, vary from country to country. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91708">We owe it to our children to do what we can to protect them from predators, whether it is a family friend, camp counsellor or a pedophile on the net. It is only logical that Canada would enforce the same laws on the net that we do in the real world. While this may be a difficult challenge, society's efforts to protect children must not change simply because technology has changed.</ParaText><ParaText id="91709">The global nature of the Internet makes any police response difficult because offenders and/or victims may not be in the same country. This underscores the need for an international approach to this problem and Canada must be at the forefront of such an initiative.</ParaText><ParaText id="91710">Society is only now beginning to learn of the dark side of the Internet. The sexual exploitation of children is only one of the many other types of crimes committed online. Sabotage, fraud and hacking all present major problems for companies, individuals and governments, and all deserve a law enforcement response. However, there is no more precious commodity than our children and no more important priority than their well-being.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91711">What is an appropriate sentence for the Internet luring of a child? That is really the crux of the debate today. I would suggest that there are a wide range of opinions. For a child who has been sexually abused or harmed in other ways, and most especially the parents and friends of such child, 10 years imprisonment as suggested by the bill may be inadequate. That is an understandable response. For the sponsor of the bill a maximum of 10 years is more in line of what he feels is appropriate.</ParaText><ParaText id="91712">For the government of the day four short years ago and its justice minister, as well as the justice ministers of our 10 provinces and three territories, five years imprisonment would have been an appropriate response. The approach of the Conservative government and its predecessors, the Canadian Alliance and the Reform Party, have the same theme: more incarceration and double, triple the prison times. That will certainly deter child sex predators and pedophiles, that will be the fix for them.</ParaText><ParaText id="91713">Four years ago the former Liberal government put in place this offence with a sentence that was thought to be appropriate under the circumstances. Before we change that sentence, I would like to see the empirical evidence and statistics to support the premise that an increase in penalties, a doubling of penalties, is warranted. Then we can respond to this legislation in an informed and educated way.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

This issue is very important to me because I am aware that for a 13-year-old child, chatting on the Internet is much more interesting than doing homework. Every day I have to bring myself to discipline him to make him understand that too much chatting is not good.</ParaText><ParaText id="91716">Unfortunately, I believe this bill does not achieve the goals that it sets out to achieve. The Bloc Québécois has always recognized the need to better protect children and it took an active part in the pursuit of this goal, including through the recent addition of provisions on the luring of children to the Criminal Code. However, the increased maximum sentence proposed in Bill <Document DbId="2182343" Type="4">C-277</Document> for this offence is aimed specifically and deliberately at increasing the scope of Bill <Document DbId="2172003" Type="3">C-9</Document> on conditional sentencing.</ParaText><ParaText id="91717">In fact, Bill <Document DbId="2182343" Type="4">C-277</Document>, combined with Bill <Document DbId="2172003" Type="3">C-9</Document>, will give judges less flexibility and will take away from them the possibility of handing down a conditional sentence in certain minor cases. Currently, conditional sentences allow judges to give a person who is not a threat to society a sentence of less than two years to be served in the community. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91718">Bill <Document DbId="2172003" Type="3">C-9</Document>, introduced by the Conservatives in the spring, eliminates conditional sentences for offences punishable by a maximum of 10 years or more.</ParaText><ParaText id="91719">The Bloc Québécois opposes this bill because the list of offences for which conditional sentences would be eliminated is arbitrary and includes offences such as graffiti, counterfeit money, credit fraud, false prospectus and mail theft. </ParaText><ParaText id="91720">Furthermore, by removing judges' prerogatives to order sentences in the community, Quebec and the other provinces would assume the additional financial burden of having to imprison more people, while that money could be better spent on rehabilitation and prevention. </ParaText><ParaText id="91721">The Bloc wants to do whatever it takes to protect children from predators. Unfortunately, the Bloc believes that Bill <Document DbId="2182343" Type="4">C-277</Document> is not the way to achieve this.</ParaText><ParaText id="91722">Once again, the ideology of this Conservative government is modeled after the Americans. The government's proposal is based on the slogan <I>Tough on crime</I>. The idea behind this is simple, that is, to put as many criminals as possible in prison where the living conditions are intolerable and to keep them there as long as possible.</ParaText><ParaText id="91723">According to the Conservatives, this should get the criminals off the streets and dissuade others from committing crimes.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91724">Furthermore, they believe that punishment is the key to controlling crime. The philosophy behind their policy is this: if penalties are lax, crime rates go up; if they are tough, crime rates come down.</ParaText><ParaText id="91725">However, our American neighbours have proven that this model does not work. The homicide rate in the United States is three times higher than in Canada, and four times higher than in Quebec. California spent $14 billion to build prisons between 1982 and 1993. The prison population increased by 500% and the overall crime rate went up by 75%.</ParaText><ParaText id="91726">In 1992, the situation was compared to that of Texas, which reacted very differently to the pressure on its prison system in the 1980s. In an economic recession, Texas decided to build fewer prisons and to impose more conditional releases. The only difference noted between the two crime rates was a certain increase in the repetitive nature of offences against property, although certain indications also attributed this to high unemployment rates in Texas during that time.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91727">According to the information available, there is simply no compelling evidence that imprisonment or various periods of imprisonment have a greater deterrent effect, even for property offences. There are even some reasons to believe the opposite: recidivism rates for imprisoned offenders are higher than those for individuals given non-custodial sentences.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp><ParaText id="91728">This is why the Bloc Québécois disagrees with this way of thinking, and it is not alone. In the 1988 report of the Standing Committee on Justice and Solicitor General entitled “Taking Responsibility”, the committee admits that imprisonment has had no effect on rehabilitation, has not been a great deterrent and has contributed to protecting society only temporarily. </ParaText><ParaText id="91729">It also says that sure solutions to crime prevention are further sharing of wealth, working on better social integration and relying on rehabilitation. We can also see the success of the Quebec model, based on rehabilitation. There are fewer violent crimes in Quebec than anywhere else in Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="91730">In the past, the Bloc Québécois has taken concrete measures on several occasions to better protect citizens. As evidence of this, we have antigang legislation, the reversal of the burden of proof, the reopening of RCMP detachments—thus better border region security—and protection against sexual exploitation and forced labour. The Bloc Québécois pressed the government to give priority to adopting this bill that will provide more legal tools to police officers in the fight against the scourge of sexual exploitation and forced labour. We also have a DNA bank. These are real tools that we can work with. Imprisonment is never the best solution. </ParaText><ParaText id="91731">Victims of violence are always foremost in our concerns. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91732">Better protection for citizens is also and primarily accomplished by attacking the root of the problem and the causes of crime and violence. Poverty, inequality, and feeling excluded are the breeding grounds of crime. </ParaText><ParaText id="91733">The report by the Association des services de réhabilitation sociale du Québec deems conditional sentencing to be a tough, safe, and coherent measure that serves as a deterrent. In addition to its punitive value, conditional sentencing promotes the social reintegration of offenders without compromising the safety of our communities. </ParaText><ParaText id="91734">This measure, which has the support of the public, makes it possible to have a longer period of supervision for offenders jailed for committing similar offences. Abolishing conditional sentencing for more than 160 offences will not lead to improved safety of our communities. On the contrary, in the medium and long term, safety could be compromised.</ParaText><ParaText id="91735">Incarceration, particularly when unnecessary, can significantly impact offenders and their families in several ways: it can lead to loss of employment, poverty, isolation, worsening of social problems, loss of custody of children, inability to carry out certain responsibilities, loss of independence and so forth. These factors can place offenders and their families in a situation that is even more precarious and that could increase the chance of recidivism or firmly establish a lifestyle based on crime.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91736">Before handing down a conditional sentence, the judge must make sure that the offender does not represent a threat to society. This helps ensure that conditional sentencing is a safe alternative.</ParaText><ParaText id="91737">It is also said that serving time in prison tends to increase the risk of reoffending, as compared to community-based sentences. That is also true. We are talking about crimes that can sometimes be abhorrent in some instances and pretty minor in other instances, but the judge could no longer use his or her discretion in sentencing. That is really dangerous.</ParaText><ParaText id="91738">Public opinion is in favour of conditional sentencing, while showing a legitimate concern about the individuals' dangerousness and about certain types of violent crimes. The Supreme Court of Canada has pointed out that conditional sentences are designed not only to punish and denounce, but also to rehabilitate. The highest court of the land further stated that such a sentence provides an alternative which promotes both monitoring and behavioural improvement. </ParaText><ParaText id="91739">Moreover, this is a sentence that allows people to show that they are able to function properly in society, to take responsibility for their behaviour and to abide by the mandatory and optional terms and conditions of the conditional sentence order.</ParaText><ParaText id="91740">I will conclude with these words of my brilliant colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78559" Type="2">Hochelaga</Affiliation>:</ParaText>

I had the pleasure to work with the Media Awareness Network, which is based in Ottawa. Its work has been picked up and used as a model throughout the country. In fact, it is internationally renowned. What it does is educate young people. As its name suggests, it brings to schools, to children and to young people the tools they need to navigate not only the Internet, but various other media as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="91745">This is really important. All we have to do is turn on the television, walk down the streets and see the billboards, or look at our magazine stands. I believe we have taken the wrong direction in our society in how we display children and women and how we have sexualized and turned women and children into objects. Part of luring is about objectification, how we have commodified human beings.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91746">I have two young boys. Sadly, it is something that I have had to educate them about at a very early age, about why we have magazines displayed that objectify women in advertising to sell products, when it has nothing to do with the product. We have this kind of pollution put in front of us and seemingly as a society we okay it or we do not do much about it.</ParaText><ParaText id="91747">With Media Awareness Network, we were able to teach students from the elementary level to high school and show them what kinds of media were out there and how to interpret some of the images. Let us be honest, it is quite confusing for someone who is four, five or six years of age to see some of these images in magazines, on television screens and on the Internet, and to try to understand how that relates to what they see in their everyday lives.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91748">Quite clearly, if one were to take all the images that are thrown at our young people and children, put them in a context and say that this is reality, I think we would find that most children would be very confused and very disturbed if they were not given the guidance that most parents and teachers give. They need to be told that this is not reality, that this is a version of someone's reality and it does not reflect our human family and our human dimensions.</ParaText><ParaText id="91749">I wanted to start off with that because in essence what we are talking about is the objectification, the exploitation, the sexualization of young people, of children and of women, and we have seen that in the past. That is the heart of this issue. It is how we can tackle what really has become the commodification of human beings.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91750">With that in mind, what we did with the Media Awareness Network was put young people onto the Internet and have them show us the kinds of sites and images that they saw on a day to day basis. This had to to do with advertising, the kinds of things that kids are confronted with all the time. We pointed out there were places that were dangerous and what they should do if someone talked to them on a chat line, how to prevent being lured and why these people do this. Again, it is very confusing for young people. Quite rightly, we hope, young people trust others. Sadly, there are people who exploit that.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp><ParaText id="91751">What we really need to do is give them the tools to ensure they are not victimized. On that I guess I am a little surprised at the government's approach to this. On certain days we will hear the government say that this kind of behaviour is the fault of poor parenting. In essence, what it saying is that the government will be the parent because the parents are unable to do this. The government will make sure it does it. It will have the big hand of the law and take care of everything.</ParaText><ParaText id="91752">I am sad to say that this is not good enough and it is intellectually incongruent with what this political party asserts most of the time.</ParaText><ParaText id="91753"> I also have to mention this weeks cutbacks to literacy to help grassroots organizations, schools, community organizations and libraries. They work with young people to give them the tools they need to ensure they are aware of what is out there, the kinds of predators, the pitfalls when one turns on a computer. They need to know there are people out there of whom they should be weary.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91754">I find it strange that we have a government that on the one hand is saying we need to have a law like this, I would suppose, and without prejudice, because it would take care of the problem of luring children. On the other hand the government seems to be taking away all the tools that have been provided to prevent this. Ultimately, the way to deal with problems such as luring children is to prevent hee crime from happening. </ParaText><ParaText id="91755">I want to turn my attention to what has been done to date in other jurisdictions and what can be done. For the Ottawa police service and for many other police services, one of the problems they have right now is they do not have the tools to deal with the Internet being used as a tool, be it for luring children or for other crimes. Yet as Canadians, we are probably best suited to deal with this problem. We are at the top of the class in developing software and other IT tools to track this kind of phenomena. We have seen that when we have had to deal with and seriously take on concerns around terrorism.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91756">On the other hand, when we are talking about police services and their ability and financial and human capacity to deal with Internet crimes, it seems as though it is an afterthought. That is not because they have not identified it. I happen to know the people on the police services board in Ottawa. I happen to know that this is a concern around the country, and I am sure other members know this. One of the problems police services are having right now is they do not have enough person power. They do not have enough of the IT tools that are necessary. Particularly, the police do not have people who are trained and who can remain in those positions.</ParaText><ParaText id="91757">This is the kind of approach we need. It is the kind of thing we need to do to prevent these kinds of crimes from happening. We need to be able to identify predators who are on line. Then we can arrest these people and make sure something can happen before the crime happens.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91758">My major concern about the bill is not enough attention has been paid the prevention of crime. I extend that to an analysis on the approach the government seems to be taking on crime in general. Getting tough on crime is hard to argue with in some instances. However, it begs the question, what is the government doing to protect people and prevent these crimes?</ParaText><ParaText id="91759">If we are unable to have a debate and to put in the tools to prevent crime, then we are not fulfilling our responsibility and our jobs as legislators. Ultimately, we have failed our communities and we have failed children.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Let us send this bill to committee so that we can find out what tools are needed.</ParaText><ParaText id="91765">Bill <Document DbId="2182343" Type="4">C-277</Document> addresses the seriousness of a criminal behaviour that targets our children: Internet luring.</ParaText><ParaText id="91766">Since 2002 it has been a crime in Canada to use the Internet to communicate with a child for the purpose of facilitating the commission of child sexual exploitation or abduction against a child. Because we criminalize this behaviour, we have to be able to track for the first time the prevalence of this type of activity.</ParaText><ParaText id="91767">Over 600 Internet luring cases have been referred to the police by Cybertip since 2002. The trend seems to show that it is becoming an increasingly more common problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="91768">Cybertip has been Canada's national tip line for child sexual exploitation on the Internet. It has been in operation collecting valuable data and referring child sexual exploitation cases to the police since 2002. The data provided by Cybertip.ca and the anecdotal evidence that has been collected over the last four years paints a disturbing picture of a typical Internet luring case.</ParaText><ParaText id="91769">Picture a man in his mid to late 30s who portrays himself as a 17-year-old boy, who spends his time online in teen chat rooms. Now picture a young girl, 13 years old, who likes to chat with her friends in the teen's chat room, where the conversations get a little racy. Imagine this man gaining the trust of this young girl, striking up a friendship, talking about life, love and sex. Imagine this man taking the relationship to another level, telephone calls, using webcams and perhaps even in-person meetings. This is a typical scenario and escalation of events in cases where a real victim is at risk.</ParaText><ParaText id="91770">This criminal behaviour is becoming increasingly prevalent, which means that Canadian children are increasingly at risk.</ParaText><ParaText id="91771">When the luring provision was originally enacted, it was introduced to address a problem. The problem was not related to luring per se because luring itself is not a new phenomenon but one that has been greatly facilitated by the Internet and its associated technologies.</ParaText><ParaText id="91772">The problem with the act of luring, the grooming and enticing of a young person, was at that time there was no specific offence of luring to commit a child sexual offence and it fell short of an attempt to commit a child sexual exploitation offence. Canadian jurisprudence that dealt with the issue of attempts required that the act, which would constitute the attempt, would be more than mere preparation. It would be difficult to characterize chat or email as more than mere preparation, hence, the creation of the offence of luring a child. The new offence criminalized communicating for the purpose of facilitating the commission of a child sexual exploitation or abduction offence.</ParaText><ParaText id="91773">Why is all of this very important? Because this is how the current penalty of the luring provision was determined. </ParaText><ParaText id="91774">Under the Criminal Code the penalty for attempts is half that of the substantive offence that was attempted. Therefore, since the new luring provision, in a way, criminalized activity that was somewhat less than what could normally be characterized as an attempt, it was seen as appropriate that the penalty should be half of what the other child sexual exploitation offences carried.</ParaText><ParaText id="91775">Today we look at Internet luring very differently. The prevalence of this criminal behaviour and the risk of physical contact have been two supporting factors for treating this crime more seriously.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="00">(1400)</Timestamp><ParaText id="91776">However, it is the direct contact that is made between the predator and the victim via the Internet, where a relationship of trust is created for the sole purpose of exploiting the young person and betraying his or her trust, which escalates this behaviour above that of an attempt and puts it onto a level with that of the other child sexual exploitation offences.</ParaText><ParaText id="91777">The last time we debated the bill, a number of questions were posed in relation to it. After careful consideration of its aims and purposes, I think we may have the answers to those questions.</ParaText><ParaText id="91778"> If members will allow me to refresh the collective memory of the House, the questions were the following. Does the existing penalty of Internet luring adequately reflect the serious nature of this offence, particularly in comparison to other contact child sexual offences? Would the proposed new maximum penalty be consistent with the penalty with contact child sexual offences? Would it be consistent with other measures that are currently before Parliament, including Bill <Document DbId="2172003" Type="3">C-9</Document>, which proposes Criminal Code reforms to prevent the use of conditional sentences for offences that carry a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment or more?</ParaText><ParaText id="91779">These are good questions. I believe I have already answered the first question, in that the current penalty scheme does not adequately reflect the seriousness of this type of criminal behaviour. Internet luring should be treated in the same way as the other Criminal Code offences relating to child sexual exploitation.</ParaText><ParaText id="91780">Second, Bill <Document DbId="2182343" Type="4">C-277</Document>, as amended, which calls for increasing the maximum penalty on indictment and summary conviction for the luring offence to 10 years and 18 months respectively, is completely consistent with the maximum penalties for the other child sexual exploitation contact offences. Only two child sexual exploitation offences continue to have a five year maximum penalty on indictment. Both are related to child pornography, possession and accessing, where contact with the potential child victim is not an element of the offence.</ParaText><ParaText id="91781">Finally, the bill is also complementary to government bills currently before the House, namely Bill <Document DbId="2172003" Type="3">C-9</Document>, on conditional sentence of imprisonment, and Bill <Document DbId="2304794" Type="3">C-22</Document>, on the age of protection. Bill <Document DbId="2182343" Type="4">C-277</Document> also fits into the government's priority on tackling crime and, more specifically, on treating child sex exploitation crimes more seriously.</ParaText><ParaText id="91782">If enacted, Bill <Document DbId="2182343" Type="4">C-277</Document> would, by virtue of raising the maximum penalty on indictment for the luring offence to 10 years, bring the offence up to the threshold contemplated in Bill <Document DbId="2172003" Type="3">C-9</Document>, which would remove the possibility of a conditional sentence, or house arrest, if the accused was prosecuted by the way of indictment.</ParaText><ParaText id="91783">Bill <Document DbId="2172003" Type="3">C-9</Document> in its current form proposes to remove the possibility of conditional sentencing orders, which we commonly refer to as house arrest, for all serious crimes. Bill C-9 currently defines serious crimes as those crimes that carry a penalty of 10 years or more on indictment. The use of conditional sentencing in child sexual exploitation cases has been seriously criticized and Bill <Document DbId="2182343" Type="4">C-277</Document> and Bill C-9 together will answer that criticism in part.</ParaText><ParaText id="91784">Bill<Document DbId="2304794" Type="3">C-22</Document>, on the age of protection, although not directly linked to the penalty enhancements that are being proposed in Bill <Document DbId="2182343" Type="4">C-277</Document>, will expand the protective shield of section 172.1, the luring offence. Currently all children under 14 years are fully protected by section 172.1, but only some youth between 14 years and 18 years are protected by it. When Bill <Document DbId="2304794">C-22</Document> is enacted, the full protection of the luring offence will be extended to all children under 16 years.</ParaText><ParaText id="91785">New technologies, including the Internet, have created new opportunities for Canadians, and for the most part they have been extremely positive. However, they have also created new opportunities for would-be child molesters to anonymously and secretly enter into our homes through the Internet with a view to sexually exploiting our children.</ParaText><ParaText id="91786">Since its enactment in 2002, section 172.1 has served as a useful and effective tool for law enforcement and has resulted in convictions. In a recent Nova Scotia case, Kevin Randall was convicted of Internet luring as a result of engaging in explicit online communications with a person he believed was a 13-year-old girl but who was in reality an undercover police officer. The offender had arranged to meet the 13-year-old girl at a coffee shop, where the police apprehended him with a pocketful of condoms.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="05">(1405)</Timestamp><ParaText id="91787">Clearly, section 172.1 is an important tool for law enforcement and it is being used to successfully secure the conviction of offenders.

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Szabo" id="1663989"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78477" Type="2">Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="91789">Mr. Speaker, I do not think there is a member in this place who does not have a great deal of concern about issues that impact children. The cliché is that children are our future, but they, together with seniors--and I suspect people would agree with me--are the most vulnerable in our society because they can be taken advantage of depending on their circumstances. </ParaText><ParaText id="91790">We really get into a situation where people are now saying that this is even more serious. In fact, I have had a private member's motion that called for more serious penalties for those who abuse a spouse as opposed to committing assault against another person, the reason being that when someone abuses their spouse, they are violating a trust relationship. Therefore, it is an exacerbating circumstance and the penalty should be greater than the penalty for simply getting into a fight with a stranger in a bar and punching him in the nose. There is something different and it is called an exacerbating factor.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91791">I think members would agree that issues to do with harming children is an exacerbating factor. One member even said he did not think current penalties reflect the seriousness of the crime.</ParaText><ParaText id="91792"> A Bloc member spoke about her grandchild and the need to take care of that grandchild to give it the guidance it needs. If something untoward happened to that grandchild and we asked what should be done in terms of the response of the juridical system, the person with the emotional attachment is going to say, “Throw away the key”. The person will say that the individual who harmed that grandchild has absolutely no right to be in our society. That could be the solution to all serious crimes, to just throw away the key. The trouble is that it is not something we can do. I know that this point alone on just throwing away the key when people do bad things would be a very interesting debate in Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="91793">But in our system today, even those who commit the most serious crimes such as first degree murder, punishable by a sentence of 25 years' imprisonment, eventually will be released into society. They will be released with certain conditions, but they will be out of jail. That, in certain circumstances like the Clifford Olson crimes, is totally unacceptable. There are provisions for incarceration for longer periods of time, but in general first degree murderers eventually get back into society.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91794">That is why our judicial system is based on the principle of rehabilitation. It means that if someone in jail for a serious crime admits their crime and takes programs to rehabilitate themselves to reintegrate into society, they may qualify for probation and get out a little earlier. That is only if they behave themselves and take the program. Those who do not want to probably do not even get probation. Many get turned down because they are not sorry for their crimes. They do not realize the seriousness of their crimes or the damage they have caused to society.</ParaText><ParaText id="91795">I am going to support Bill <Document DbId="2182343" Type="4">C-277</Document> at second reading to go to committee. I am going to recommend it to my caucus colleagues because I think that although we have had a very large debate going on in Parliament, very piecemeal, this private member's bill may very well be the proxy for us to start talking about the whole sentencing and judicial model and whether or not we have confidence in our judges and in the courts, and whether we believe that some cases are different from others, even for the same crime. I can give members an example.</ParaText><ParaText id="91796">For instance, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba surveyed people in their prisons and found that about 50% of them suffered from alcohol related birth defects, fetal alcohol syndrome. It is a mental illness. Rehabilitation is not applicable to them, but they are in jail. Why are they in jail? They committed crimes, but they did not know the difference between right and wrong. Should they get the same penalty? Should they be in the same system where rehabilitation is what we do? Probably not. They should probably be in appropriate institutions to help them learn how to cope with their disability and their mental health.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="10">(1410)</Timestamp><ParaText id="91797">The courts have taken a greater latitude in looking at each case individually to find out whether there are exacerbating or in fact mitigating circumstances. I do not believe the latitude can be taken away from the courts and judges to be able to determine whether there are exacerbating or mitigating factors.</ParaText><ParaText id="91798">This bill, although it is very simple in saying to just increase the penalties from 5 to 10 years, is quite straightforward, but the enormity of the implications and the breadth of the discussion are absolutely phenomenal. </ParaText><ParaText id="91799">This is a hybrid offence. It means that matters can be handled by a summary conviction or by indictment. It may also still permit, in certain circumstances, conditional sentencing. It may in fact impose a mandatory minimum, effectively, in an inappropriate circumstance. I am not sure whether there is a model that is going to fit all. I am not sure whether raising the penalty from 5 to 10 years is going to be the best solution.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91800">I am one member of Parliament. I have some concerns. I know we do not have the tools to be able to deal with these complex issues in debate of private members' business. We do not have the same opportunity to have a fulsome debate on the vital issues and all the relevant issues, but we do know one thing. We know that at committee we will have the opportunity to have that clear debate with the officials from the justice department and from groups and organizations who are advocating on behalf of protecting children and from the public at large through their members of Parliament. That is where this should happen. That is why I think it is extremely important that we get this bill to committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="91801">I should specifically indicate with regard to the bill that although it simply doubles the sentence from 5 to 10 years for a conviction by indictment for luring a child into a sexual act through the Internet, the bill does not alter the existing availability of summary conviction procedure, where the maximum sentence would be six months in prison. People will never understand a sentence of six months' imprisonment for someone who is a sexual predator. There is something wrong with that, and I agree.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91802">It appears there is a second purpose of the bill. That is to bring this offence within a class of offences for which government Bill <Document DbId="2172003" Type="3">C-9</Document> would remove conditional sentencing as an option if and only if proceeded with by indictment. We have to note that all other sentencing options, including suspended sentence, probation, fines, et cetera, would in fact remain with this bill whether the indictment or summary procedure was used. It is not exactly as advertised, as just increasing the sentence from 5 to 10 years. There is a lot more included in the family of possible outcomes with regard to a case.</ParaText><ParaText id="91803">The offence of luring in section 172.1 prohibits only communication to facilitate possible sexual acts. It is not the actual acts themselves that are dealt with. So the bill may be short, but the implications and the related issues are very broad.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91804">I would like to conclude. I tend to agree with the speaker from the New Democratic Party who wanted to reach out to the House and to Canadians and say that bad things happen in this world but human beings are not born bad. They are a function of their environment. Loving, caring parents who guide them and give them a good sense of values help them to grow up to be good contributing members of society, but those who do not get that loving, that caring and that teaching obviously are the ones who have a higher probability of getting into some difficulty.</ParaText><ParaText id="91805">We do not need just tougher sentences. We still have to use all of the tools available. They involve prevention and education. They involve rehabilitation. They involve, in some cases, mandatory minimum sentences. In other cases, quite frankly, they require putting a person away and throwing away the key because there are cases that turn out like that. </ParaText><ParaText id="91806">I want to thank the member for bringing the bill forward, but I think members have shown the House that this bill has many more sweeping implications and that it should go to committee for us to properly address those other aspects of the bill.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="15">(1415)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Ménard (Marc-Aurèle-Fortin)" id="1664002"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78405" Type="2">Mr. Serge Ménard (Marc-Aurèle-Fortin, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="91807">Mr. Speaker, we can generally say that bills introduced by backbenchers are well intentioned. Members are rather radical in the solutions that they offer, probably because it is so difficult for them to take their bills all the way to the House, and it is even rarer that they get them passed. That is perhaps what is happening here. </ParaText><ParaText id="91808">All members of my party and of this House certainly feel that child exploitation in one form or another—whether sexual exploitation, which is one of the worst forms of violence, or child exploitation for economic or other purposes—is an absolutely reprehensible type of conduct that is naturally condemned. However, the clause at hand deals with only one means of luring children: through the Internet. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91809">However, if the individual continues, if he or she commits other offences, even rape, after luring the child through the Internet, these offences will be liable to tougher maximum sentences, up to and including life imprisonment. This can lead, in many cases, to more than 10 years of imprisonment, so that the judge must apply the maximum five-year sentence for luring. Moreover, he or she can decide to impose a concurrent sentence. </ParaText><ParaText id="91810">Certainly, when the judge makes the decision, he will consider the added rape or sexual exploitation, taking into account the fact that this started with the luring of a child through the Internet. Luring is thus secondary to offences that people find really reprehensible and that already carry very tough penalties under the Criminal Code. I say very tough, but I see that there are now in this House a majority of members who believe that we are never tough enough in Canada. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91811">This is all too apparent in this bill. It is not that a five-year sentence for luring a child—in addition to the sentence the offender will serve if, in the worst case, he goes as far as committing rape or sexual assault—is deemed insufficient. The worst cases will be treated according to the offence committed. No, that is not the issue. It is that some would like this offence to be in another category. They want to put it in a category where a judge cannot impose a sentence of deprivation of liberty. They want this offence to be punishable by a sentence to be served in the community.</ParaText><ParaText id="91812">I do not know why this fairly recent provision in the Criminal Code is being attacked. I believe it was approved in 1996 or 1998. I think it was 1998. I do not know of any serious studies that show that judges have abused this provision, especially since they still have recourse to probation, with what is called a suspended sentence. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91813">The difference between a conditional sentence and a suspended sentence is very simple. Under a suspended sentence, the accused is released under certain terms and conditions. No sentence is passed by the judge. If the accused abides by these terms and conditions, the judge will no longer have the ability to pass sentence. But if the accused violates the terms and conditions, he or she will be brought back before the judge to receive the sentence the judge could have passed initially. At that time, the judge may adjust the sentence, imposing a tougher or lighter one. </ParaText><ParaText id="91814">Under a conditional sentence, the judge gives a sentence of two years or less, which the accused may serve in the community under certain terms and conditions. These generally include a curfew requiring the individuals to be home by a certain time in the evening, the obligation to work, the obligation to support their family, and so on. If the terms and conditions are violated, then the accused has to serve the rest of his or her sentence in prison.</ParaText><ParaText id="91815">In other words, a person sentenced to serve 18 months at home who abides by the terms and conditions for 17 straight months, and then violates them after 17,5 months, will have to spend two weeks in prison to finish serving his or her sentence.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="20">(1420)</Timestamp><ParaText id="91816">Had the same person received a suspended sentence and violated the terms and conditions after 17 months, the judge would have said, “I gave you a break; now, I am sentencing you to imprisonment”.</ParaText><ParaText id="91817">The Bloc Québécois is among those who have most actively promoted this change to the Criminal Code. We believed that the legislation had to take into account new technologies and the new ways they provide of luring children. The Bloc Québécois therefore supported the establishment of a new offence. This needs, however, to be set in a broader context. We also have to look at the offence of using a computer to lure a child from the perspective of sexual assault. I think members will agree that sexual assault is a more serious offence than luring a child. Bear in mind that a child is under the age of 18 or 16—</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I had hoped that debate on this bill would transcend our partisan differences and for the most part it has. I especially want to thank those members of the opposition parties who have agreed to support the bill at least as far as the committee stage is concerned. For those who have expressed concerns, I respect those perspectives. I am hoping that all members of the House will at least agree to have the bill sent to committee for further review.</ParaText><ParaText id="91821">There may be some who will ask whether the bill is an overreaction to the problem of child luring. I would respond by looking at the experience in other countries such as Britain, Australia and yes, the United States. When we look at the maximum sentences for child luring in those jurisdictions, we see a range of 12 to 30 years in prison. In some cases the legislation provides for mandatory minimum sentences of five years.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91822">By comparison, Bill <Document DbId="2182343" Type="4">C-277</Document> represents a relatively modest increase in the maximum sentence from 5 to 10 years imprisonment. As my colleagues know, our government has also introduced legislation, Bill <Document DbId="2172003" Type="3">C-9</Document>, which will remove conditional sentences including house arrest where serious crimes are concerned. Increasing the maximum sentence for child luring for sexual purposes makes a clear statement that this is a serious crime and will ensure that sexual predators do not receive house arrest. </ParaText><ParaText id="91823">Members should also know that of the cases successfully prosecuted under the current child luring law, the large majority of the sentences are for terms ranging between 6 and 18 months, and most of those are conditional sentences to be served in the community. </ParaText><ParaText id="91824">My heart tells me that the protection of our children is worth much more than that. There is no doubt in my mind that offenders who are so depraved that they would take advantage of a vulnerable young child deserve tough sentences, not a sentence served in the comfort of their homes and communities.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91825">I would invite members of the House to reflect on our fundamental role as members of Parliament. That role is to ensure the safety and security of all Canadians, and to use the utmost diligence in protecting and defending the interests of the most vulnerable in our society. Clearly, young, impressionable children are included in that group. They face growing threats from a rapidly changing world, a world which is becoming increasingly less friendly and safe. More importantly, those who prey on and exploit children are becoming increasingly bold in their attempts to gain access to our children.</ParaText><ParaText id="91826">In fact, as I stated earlier, many of these predators cannot be treated and will remain a constant threat to our communities for the rest of their lives. It is our job as members of the House to ensure that we do everything within our lawful power to provide our justice system with the legal tools to keep sex predators away from our children. It is very simple. We have a job to do. Let us do it well.</ParaText><ParaText id="91827">Parents also have a job to do. I encourage parents to listen to and understand their children, inform themselves about parental controls on their child's computer, keep their child's computer in a public place, stay involved and remain vigilant, educate themselves, and understand that the Internet is not as safe as they may have assumed.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="91828">Bill <Document DbId="2182343" Type="4">C-277</Document> achieves three goals. First, it condemns in the strongest terms the sexual exploitation of our children. Second, it brings the maximum sentence for luring into line with other sexual offences. Third, it ensures that such offenders serve their sentences in jail, not in the comfort of their homes where they continue to have access to the Internet. </ParaText><ParaText id="91829">The message of the bill is very clear. If people choose to prey on our children, they will pay a significant price. I encourage the members of the House to put aside partisanship and do something significant for our children. At the very least, refer the bill to committee. Our children deserve nothing less.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
