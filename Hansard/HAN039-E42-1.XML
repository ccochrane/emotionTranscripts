Robert Nault (Kenora, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4270428">Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure and an honour to have the opportunity to speak today to the first budget of the new government. This is my opportunity to speak directly about the budget as it relates to northern Ontario and rural Canada. I want to start by saying that this is a historic budget, from the perspective of the investments that will be made in the north.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270429">If we look at the Canada child benefit and the needs of northerners for child care, financial resources, aboriginal children, and communities that have a large segment of their population who are unemployed or on social assistance, this Canada child benefit will have a disproportionate way of improving the lives of northerners more than any other region in the country. There are thousands of families in the north who are living in poverty, who do not have jobs, who are on social assistance. They could have an opportunity to collect the child benefit, and it would make improvements to the lives of those families right off the bat. That $23 billion that will be moved as early as July 1 will have a significant impact in regions like northern Ontario.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4270430">I want to congratulate the government for understanding the importance of raising children, and also understanding that there have to be options. It is not all about child care spaces. It is about the importance of having enough financial resources to buy food and clothes. We have had debates in this House about aboriginal people in the last few days. I strongly recommend that people visit communities in the north that are isolated, where the cost of living is sometimes double that in the south. If people had an opportunity to visit these isolated communities, some 22 that I represent in northern Ontario, in the heart of North America, they will find that this will be a welcome and historic investment in the lives of these communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270431">Because of the child benefit and the importance of of it being tax free and not clawed back, there will be an opportunity for people who are on social assistance and who fill out their income tax return to gain more opportunity to buy clothes, food, and other essentials for life. I want to ensure that members are aware of that.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270432">Before I forget, Mr. Speaker, I want you to know that I am splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="214080" Type="2">Vaughan—Woodbridge</Affiliation>.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4270433">The other major historic investment that could have a huge impact in northern Ontario is the investment in infrastructure. I have heard some comments across the way that it is not enough this year and that it is not what was expected. However, we all have to be very straight about how this will work.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270434">It will be a historic investment of some $120 billion of federal funds. That does not include in the discussion the share of the provincial, municipal, and first nations governments in infrastructure. If we look at it from the perspective of even being divided in thirds, we could in essence be talking about $350 billion over 10 years, if all levels of government participate. That is a lot of money to be putting into the process of developing our country's infrastructure. This is where I want to talk more about the north than I normally do. In this place, there is a big difference in representing a large rural riding which is one-third of Ontario's land mass, with 13 municipalities, 42 first nations, and virtually no infrastructure. This is a great opportunity for us in this place to support the building of the north, for the first time in decades.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4270435">It is always interesting in this House to listen to members of Parliament, in particular from urban Canada, talk about the importance of transit in Toronto or Montreal or places like that. However, where I come from, there are no roads. When we talk about transit, we have to start from the basics.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4270436">If we are going to invest and build our nation, if we are going to improve the lives of first nation citizens who live in isolated communities, we are going to have to start from the very basics of putting the financial resources, the infrastructure dollars, into building all-weather roads and grids.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270437">If we want first nations children to be successful, they have to start off with the same level playing field. These communities have to have the same infrastructure, the same abilities to see the progression of their lives in a positive way, as our children do. This infrastructure does not have to happen this year, because planning needs to take place.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270438">Let us talk about all-weather roads and grids. I will use Pikangikum as an example, because I attended the funerals last week of the nine people passed away in a major fire there. There was a lot of conversation nationally about it. Pikangikum has a shovel-ready project to build a grid that would connect energy to the community and allow it to have sewer and water, an operational recreation facility, and housing that is connected to energy. All of this is ready to go. All we need is the green light from the Government of Canada and the participation of the provincial government. We could build an all-weather road and the grid next to it, starting this year. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4270439">That shovel-ready project has been sitting on the books now for a number of years. The previous government could have put that infrastructure in place for Pikangikum, but refused to do it. That is one of the reasons there are the kinds of tragic situations that we hear about on a regular basis.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270440">My region, northern Ontario, does not have a twinned highway. It is the only region of the country, aside from the Northwest Territories and in some respects, obviously, the Yukon and Nunavut, that does not have that kind of infrastructure, from the Manitoba border into southern Ontario. When people talk about infrastructure, it is extremely important to realize that my region is coming from a long way back. If we want people to be successful, we have to start with the basic infrastructure that we all need and expect to have.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270441">The other part of this budget that I think is extremely important for northerners is the section on social infrastructure. There is $3.4 billion in the budget over five years for social infrastructure. What is social infrastructure? Social infrastructure includes affordable housing, early learning and child care, cultural and recreational infrastructure, and community health care facilities in places like reserves. Those are the kinds of historic things in this budget.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4270442">The next historic part of this budget is the environment, the whole concept of understanding what we need to do not only as northerners but as Canadians and citizens of the globe. We have to take our environmental issues a lot more seriously than we have in the past.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270443">I always tell people I am a lake person. Where I come from, there are thousands of lakes, in some cases lakes that people have never set foot on because they are so isolated. There seems to be more water than there is land. We have to not only cherish that but protect it, because that is the history and the future of my region; it is all going to be based on water.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270444">This budget put in place $5.5 million for the watershed on Lake of the Woods, which is where I live, and it will have a huge impact in doing studies on the effects that climate change and pollution have on a lake as large as Lake of the Woods. It runs into Manitoba and the United States, as well as Ontario. It is a big lake with a lot of issues that need to be dealt with, and I commend the government for understanding what that means.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270445">I stand here today to remind my colleagues in the House that making investments in infrastructure is not always political. It has to be done because it makes the most sense.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4270446">We will not get a lot of political bang for our buck for spending billions of dollars in northern Ontario for one seat, two seats, or three seats, but we do it because it builds the nation and it improves the lives of a lot of people, now and in the future.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270447">On behalf of northerners, I am thankful for being given the time to talk about some of the issues in the budget. I am sure we will get a chance to talk about many more.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Budget 2016 would put people first, and it would deliver the help that Canadians and the residents of Vaughan—Woodbridge need now, not a decade from now. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4270468">As an economist and someone who worked in the global financial markets for nearly a quarter of a century, I can state with expertise that budget 2016 is fiscally prudent. It is a responsible approach to fiscal management, cemented through a fiscal anchor. Thanks to measures taken in the mid-1990s, Canada has the lowest debt-to-GDP ratio of any G7 country, and with interest rates at historic lows, now is the time to invest in Canadians to ensure our country's best days lie ahead.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270469">However, Canada's fiscal strength rests largely in its low debt burden, and protecting this source of strength is of paramount importance. To maintain Canada's low debt burden and its fiscal advantage, our government is committed to reducing the federal debt-to-GDP ratio to a lower level over a five-year period, ending in 2020-2021. This commitment preserves the government's capacity to respond to potential future economic crises, so that future generations are not burdened. </ParaText><ParaText id="4270470">I am extremely proud of budget 2016. I know it would make a positive difference in the lives of the residents of Vaughan—Woodbridge. I wish to highlight a few measures that are particularly significant to me and my constituents, including measures that strengthen the middle class, undertake strategic investments in infrastructure that build stronger communities, introduce the transformational Canada child benefit, and ensure a dignified retirement for our seniors. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4270471">One of the first actions our government took was to introduce a $3 billion middle-class tax cut and to ask the wealthiest 1% to pay a bit more. In total, nearly nine million Canadians, including many in my riding, are now benefiting from this tax cut, leaving more money in their paycheques to save, invest, and grow the economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270472"> I am proud of this government's commitment to families with the introduction of the transformational CCB. The CCB would now be tax free to parents, better targeted to those who need it the most, and much more generous. In fact, nine out of 10 families would receive more child benefits than under the current system, with an average increase of almost $2,300.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270473"> Even more significant is that, with the introduction of a better targeted CCB, about 300,000 fewer children would be living in poverty. The CCB would be a leading force in our efforts toward poverty reduction, and for this our government should be applauded by all members of the House.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4270474">We know all too well the growing infrastructure deficit faced by cities and provinces across Canada, and we know that our economic well-being depends on our ability to move people, goods, and services. Our government listened during the election campaign and heard the unified voice from experts, including from Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz, who noted that “Infrastructure is an ingredient to economic growth. It’s sort of the enabler of economic growth”. That is why we have made a historic commitment to invest $120 billion in infrastructure over 10 years. This is a smart investment that is much needed. Studies have consistently shown that, for every dollar invested in infrastructure, approximately $1.50 in economic activity is generated. Investing in infrastructure creates good, well-paying jobs that can help the middle class grow and prosper.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4270475"> Our investments in infrastructure, be it public, social, or green, are not just about creating jobs and economic growth but, more importantly, are also about building communities that Canadians are proud to call home. Currently, congestion in the greater Toronto area is costing the economy billions of dollars and negatively impacting the quality of life of all residents. In phase 1 of the infrastructure plan, $3.4 billion over three years would be invested in public transit, of which $1.5 billion is earmarked for Ontario. This investment, along with the current infrastructure projects, including the Toronto-York Spadina subway expansion into Vaughan, would be tangible measures to begin to address the costs associated with congestion.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4270476">As we move forward, we will implement a plan for investment in infrastructure, but the government will also plan for a more innovative Canada. Innovation is today's driver of inclusive growth, and Canada must be in it to win it. In budget 2016, the government is defining a new vision for Canada's economy to build Canada as a centre of global innovation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270477">Our government will fund a $2-billion investment over three years for a new post-secondary institution strategic investment fund to modernize on-campus research, commercialization, and training facilities. Budget 2016 also provides an additional $95 million per year to strengthen Canada's world-class research capacity and excellence.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270478">Canadians face a rapidly changing global economy, and for us to succeed we must foster citizens to be global leaders in their fields and have our creative and entrepreneurial citizens propel the economy forward.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270479">The welfare of seniors is an issue that touches me greatly in my riding. Seniors helped build this great country we live in. Budget 2016 puts forward significant new investments to ensure that all seniors can enjoy a secure and dignified retirement. The planned increase of up to $947 per year, a 10% increase to the guaranteed income supplement, is set to start in July. It will help the most vulnerable single seniors. Over 900,000 seniors, including many in my riding of Vaughan—Woodbridge, will be helped by this measure, but we are doing more.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4270480">We have kept our commitment to return the age of eligibility for old age security and the guaranteed income supplement to 65 from 67, and in the coming months we will develop a seniors price index to allow seniors to keep pace with the actual cost of living they face.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270481">In addition, our government will continue discussions with the provinces to enhance the Canada pension plan. An enhanced Canada pension plan would be a major step in improving retirement outcomes for workers and reducing the uncertainty that many Canadians feel about entering retirement.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270482">Our commitment to seniors is simple. We are there for them.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270483">Finally, budget 2016 is truly a blueprint for the future, a future that is not only hopeful but built on solid foundations which are fiscally prudent and boldly aspirational.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270484">Our country's best days are ahead of us, and we will seize the opportunity to invest in Canadians, including the residents of Vaughan—Woodbridge. I am privileged to serve them. </ParaText><ParaText id="4270485">God bless Canada.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The bad news is for hard-working Canadians in this country and the good news is for some very sketchy Liberal pet projects.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270503">During the 10 years of Conservative government, there was a critical point that Canadians could count on: a promise made was a promise kept. We can imagine the surprise of Canadians when they realized that when the Liberals made a promise, it was not worth the paper that it was written on. Perhaps they thought they could take the Liberal campaign promises to the bank, but now they have found that the only thing going to the bank is a request to increase the limit on Canadian taxpayers' credit cards. That affects every Canadian.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270504">My constituents come from all walks of life: oil and gas, farmers, teachers, social service workers, protection services, community leaders, small business owners, and so many aspiring entrepreneurs. As Conservatives, we had it right with our economic formula: tax relief, training our future workforce, and supporting trade.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4270505">Take, for example, the knowledge infrastructure program, or KIP, which we introduced as part of the Conservative economic action plan. KIP was a two-year, $2-billion economic incentive to encourage infrastructure enhancement at Canadian post-secondary institutions. The program helped to provide economic stimulus, training, and subsequent employment for engineers, architects, tradespersons, and technicians in my community. It was delivered during a time of global economic distress, and it was done in an effective and expedient manner.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270506">KIP also helped to generate the advanced technologies infrastructure needed to keep Canada's research and educational facilities at the forefront of scientific advancement. Both Red Deer College and Olds College received funding under this program, and I have been told many times by people at these institutions how helpful the program was for them. It had a track record of positive results, and Conservatives were able to fund such programs while being financially responsible.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270507">During the past decade, central Alberta enjoyed a reputation of being one of the fastest-growing communities in the country.

With this budget, aspiring business owners will be hit with higher taxes, making it harder for them to save up to start a business. Existing small businesses will also be hit with higher payroll taxes through the addition of over $1 billion in new EI expenditures and higher premiums for all future employers. </ParaText><ParaText id="4270512">Additionally, the budget killed the small business hiring tax credit, which was designed to help small businesses grow and create jobs.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270513">Under the Conservatives, Canadians across the country enjoyed the lowest tax rates in 50 years. Low taxes mean more money in the pockets of every Canadian. It is not what we see in this budget.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4270514">Today more than 100,000 Canadians from across the country are out of work in the oil and gas industry alone. These Canadians have worked hard to take care of their families and they have paid more than their fair share into the system. For decades they helped pay down debt and they paid their dues. To thank them, the Liberals held a photo op in Calgary, telling struggling oil and gas workers that some of them would be getting a bizarre employment insurance extension plan. This is not the jobs creation plan that Albertans were promised.

At every mention of this apparent pride, I find myself asking how they can be so proud of this budget.

It is hardly something to of which to be proud.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270546">The bogus pride does not end there. During the election campaign, the Liberals also told the people of Canada that the Liberal government would “return Canada to a balanced budget in 2019”. Yet in budget 2016, it is completely silent on this promise and is vacant of any vision of returning our nation to a balanced budget. Surely, if the Liberals had a plan to deliver on their promise of a balanced budget in 2019, they would have put at least one line in their 269-page budget to say so. </ParaText>

The people of Canada want results from their government. The hard-working women and men of this nation, who go off to their jobs day in and day out, and their children are the ones who are now on the hook to repay this Liberal deficit. If all taxpayers must share in the weight of this debt, then it should stand to reason that all taxpayers should receive equitable benefits from this spending.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270548">Canadians deserve to know how the government plans to spend and ensure that this deficit spending is disbursed in an equitable fashion from coast to coast to coast, in rural and urban communities alike. Yet we wait for any details on how this budget will help those taxpayers and who will carry the cost. When can Canadians expect to see the infrastructure projects move ahead in their communities?

If we did spend an extra $380 million, this would not actually improve the infrastructure, but it would maintain the infrastructure at its current state.

We do not often get to cut a ribbon when the underground infrastructure is placed, but nonetheless, it is probably the most important of all, because nothing is more important than clean water and a clean environment. </ParaText><ParaText id="4270634">That is why I am proud that budget 2016 makes green infrastructure its first priority.

I was heartened that on the day of that debate, the <Affiliation DbId="214321" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> rose and said that we are being held back by the shackles of the Indian Act and that the solution lies in removing those shackles and continuing an honest nation-to-nation relationship with indigenous folks, Métis people, and Inuit people all over the country. I agree with that.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270639"> I am extremely proud of our indigenous platform and what is in budget 2016. There is targeted funding to improve the physical conditions that indigenous communities live with. There is an increase of $8.4 billion of new money over the next five years. We will invest $2.6 billion of new money in primary and secondary education over the next five years. We will invest $970 million of new money in school infrastructure over five years. We will invest $935 million of new money over five years for prevention to keep kids out of CFS, child and family services. We will invest $554 million of new money over two years for housing on reserves. </ParaText>

Listening to ministers speak about this budget, Canadians have to sit through endless and effusive hyperbole that is liberally filled with both bombast and pomposity. Liberals are indeed masters of self-congratulation. </ParaText><ParaText id="4270667">Unfortunately, the composition of the budgetary document breaks the covenant made during the election campaign with the Canadian people, as the Liberals do time and again when they say one thing and do the other. Like the progressive paint jobs the Liberals have applied to themselves in order to mask what the party really stands for, this budget's cover features a picture that cannot do anything but evoke an emotive response from those who gaze upon it: a mother and daughter holding hands as they walk on a yellow brick road toward the shining sun and a construction crane. It is beautifully crafted symbolism of good days ahead and the building of a new society. We can see that the Liberals are really hoping Canadians will judge this book by its cover.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4270668">Progressives have been walking through the desert for 10 years, waiting for a drop of change. It is little wonder, then, that the first glass of water offered to them seems to be so good. New Democrats are here to tear this cheerful mask off the Liberal budget and show Canadians what we are really dealing with. </ParaText><ParaText id="4270669">There are families that I speak to all the time who are struggling with extremely expensive child care costs that often keep women at home and out of the workforce. This is one of the most important social policies of our time, and it is not being addressed. The Liberals need to know that child care cannot be provided with a small financial transfer to individual families. </ParaText><ParaText id="4270670">Actually, Liberals do know. In a 2006 interview with the <I>National Post</I>, the Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214305" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation>, then the member for Saint Laurent—Cartierville, said: </ParaText><ParaText id="4270671"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">We need child-care facilities to provide Canadian parents with real choice.

We need a well-funded public policy on child care similar to what so many countries have done. The NDP will continue to propose its plan for $15-a-day child care, with spaces for those who need it. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4270673">We have spoken in the House a number of times about the social determinants of health, and one of these very strong social determinants is the right to food security. Food security is, by its very nature, linked to agriculture, which plays a key role in my riding of Cowichan—Malahat—Langford, as it does in many communities across Canada, yet this budget devotes a scant two pages to merely discussing the topic. There are no measures for organic or small-scale farmers. There is nothing to support value-added production, something that is critical for the industry. This is not the way to build the agricultural base that small communities need.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270674">Canada needs a healthy society, and I want to take a moment to point out how the budget lacks the infrastructure needed for actually creating one. </ParaText><ParaText id="4270675">A healthy society takes care of its seniors. People should never have to buy poor-quality food or skimp on prescription drugs just to be able to pay their rent. It is alarming that this so-called "progressive" Liberal government has totally abandoned its commitment to build long-term care facilities for seniors and increase the GST credit for new rental home construction.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270676">The Conservatives unilaterally cut health transfers, and the Liberals have not given any indication that they will reverse these cuts. We must build a health care accord now, but there is no money set aside in this budget to do so. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4270677">I think we were all encouraged when we heard the Liberal promise of $3 billion over four years for home care. Home care is desperately needed, given Canada's aging population. We must act now on this issue, and it was good to see that both parties were on side, so it is a large disappointment to see that this promise is nowhere to be found in the budget now in front of Parliament. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="45">(1145)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4270678">The budget is also missing funding for mental health, long-term care for seniors, and palliative care. The lack of palliative care is clearly disappointing, especially given that, during the 41st Parliament, we passed a motion saying that we would work on high quality home-based and hospice palliative care. The motion was not reflected in the budget document, and it is a glaring omission in light of the physician-assisted dying legislation we will soon be debating.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270679">When we speak about a sustainable society, we need to address climate change, the great challenge of our time, together. New Democrats welcome the low-carbon economy fund, but we would obviously like to see it get started sooner than 2017 and actually include details on what it means or how it works. We are still subsidizing the fossil fuel industry for the foreseeable future. The Liberals promised to repeal this Conservative subsidy in their election platform, but we still do not see it. New Democrats will continue to push the government on its promises and to propose new solutions to our pressing problems. </ParaText><ParaText id="4270680">When we talk of green infrastructure to help us transition to a sustainable economy, we remain concerned that the level of funding is inadequate for small and remote communities to receive access to these funds. I know I speak for many communities, when there is so much to be updated and restored.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4270681">In my riding of Cowichan—Malahat—Langford, the effects of climate change are being felt, both last year and in the foreseeable years. The Cowichan River is reaching dangerously low levels, and we really need to update the weir to hold back more supply. That is one thing on which I will be pressing the government. We need to have this kind of funding for our infrastructure, to make it more resilient, because climate change is happening.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270682">Why are the Liberal members of Parliament from British Columbia not standing up for B.C. ferries? I see $51 million in the budget for the Atlantic ferries, but nothing for the B.C. ferries. Why are they not standing up for our coast? BC Ferries is arguably the largest ferry transportation system in the world, and there is zero mention from the Liberals. I hope Liberal MPs from B.C. have a great time talking to their constituents about that glaring omission. </ParaText><ParaText id="4270683">On indigenous rights, the government has not kept its promises to first nations in the budget.

I hope the debate was not just a one-off and that some meaningful action comes through in this noble House. </ParaText><ParaText id="4270686">In this period of sunny ways and sunny days, the Liberal light can be quite blinding after years of Conservative darkness.

Like all of my colleagues on this side of the House, I had a lot of hope for the first Liberal budget. We are quite disappointed because, this time, we were expecting real change. The members opposite are always saying that Canadians voted for real change on October 19, but we have yet to see any. The choices and priorities set out in the budget are rather disappointing.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270705">I have a large riding with huge needs. My riding has always been neglected, forgotten, and underfunded by the federal government. Once again, I have no choice but to express my great disappointment with this budget.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270706">During the election campaign, I spoke about my riding's priorities. For example, there are many seniors in my riding and they have always been one of my biggest priorities. However, the budget does very little for them.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4270707">The youth unemployment rate is about two times higher than the national unemployment rate. For many years, we have been proposing measures to help young people find jobs, including a $4,000 tax credit for small businesses that hire young people. This is a reasonable measure that would help young people. These are the kinds of things that concerned me during the election campaign and that still concern me today.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270708">Furthermore, home mail delivery is another important issue in my riding. A northern, rural riding like mine needs this service. The government promised to restore this service, but as members on this side have pointed out many times, this budget does not even contain the words “Canada Post”.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270709">Nonetheless, I think there are many measures in the budget that should be highlighted. For example, the budget talks about shelters for indigenous women. There are about 14 shelters for some 630 communities in Canada. We are all aware of the problems facing indigenous communities, and there are huge needs. However, the budget allocates about $500,000 per community for shelters, which is nowhere near enough.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4270710">As I mentioned, in the north, in a riding like mine, construction costs are very high. I do not think $500,000 will be enough. In addition, as the representative for the riding of Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik—Eeyou, I must mention that the section in the budget on shelters does not apply to Nunavik or the James Bay area, which are also part of my riding. This is a concrete example of why I am so disappointed.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270711">Forestry is one of the major industries in my riding. I have been bringing up this issue since I became a member of Parliament, nearly five years ago.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="00">(1200)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4270712">Forestry is a major industry in Quebec and in my riding. Tens of thousands of my constituents work in this industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270713">Each year, every time I rise to talk about the government's budget, be it the former or the current government, I am disappointed by the lack of measures to provide direct assistance to this industry in my riding. For example, there is nothing here about the forest communities program or the investments in forest industry transformation program. One thing we know for sure is that it is important to invest in innovation and research and development in this industry. That is critical for the jobs in my riding that are tied to forestry.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4270714">I also want to raise the subject of employment insurance. This is a particularly tricky issue for my riding. Employment insurance figures and statistics for a riding like mine are pretty complicated and hard to understand. There is no logic to how this works in my riding. The statistics are compiled for three different regions: Nunavik, James Bay, and Abitibi-Témiscamingue. It is crazy because the situation is so different in each of these three regions of northern Quebec, which are part of my riding, that there is no logical way to approach employment insurance there. We should also condemn the government's ongoing tendency to dip into the employment insurance fund. We have condemned that repeatedly, actually. </ParaText><ParaText id="4270715">We need to talk about the parts of this budget that affect indigenous peoples. Once again, disappointment. We have talked about issues facing indigenous peoples a lot in the past few days, but people seem to forget that the needs in this country are so great. It is disappointing to see that the government did not bother to come up with a comprehensive approach to the needs of Canada's first nations. For example, as I pointed out earlier, the budget for housing breaks down to about $300,000 per community per year for the next two years. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4270716">Building a house in Nunavik or James Bay costs about $200,000. How can we continue to mitigate the effects of the housing crisis on communities when this budget provides enough funding for just one and half houses per community for the next two years? The fact that the government is not taking a holistic approach to indigenous issues is troubling.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270717">There are many points I wanted to raise. Indigenous languages are once again being ignored. Out of the 52 indigenous languages that are still spoken today, only three will survive and flourish, and mine is one of them. I am privileged that I can say that. Again, we all know the importance of language in indigenous communities and the importance of cultural continuity among aboriginal youth. That is one reason why the suicide rate is so high in those communities. Our indigenous youth have become lost between two worlds, between the indigenous world on the one hand, and the western world on the other hand. One way to help them would be to address the language issues that are so important to our communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270718">I wish I could go on, for I am just getting started, but I will take any question members may have.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I want to start by congratulating our <Affiliation DbId="214491" Type="2">finance minister</Affiliation> and our <Affiliation DbId="214491" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation> for delivering not only on our election promises, but on building a visionary budget, one which I am confident will irreversibly change the lives of millions of Canadians for the better.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270781">This budget represents a significant shift in the direction of our country. We are asking top income earners in Canada to pay a bit more so that the majority of Canadians will have more money to spend on important staples, such as food, shelter, and child care. This will greatly benefit those on the lowest end of the income ladder.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270782">This is all the more important, as budget 2016 sets the groundwork to bring in a group of people who have suffered generations of failed government policies and neglect toward equal opportunity in government services. Of course, I speak of Canada's indigenous population.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270783">This budget takes the first steps in healing old wounds and bringing about true reconciliation in our country. It is a statement that restores a promise that generations of Canadians have known: that no matter who we are or where we came from, if we work hard, we will get ahead.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270784">Today I want to devote my time to focus on two sets of policies of which I am particularly proud.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270785">This budget announced historic investment in infrastructure and our indigenous peoples, programs that will create a more equitable and prosperous country.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270786">First, with regard to infrastructure, Canada lags behind in investment to our infrastructure. Investment in infrastructure is an investment in our collective future. I compare infrastructure investments to a personal decision that I had to make many years ago. I recall the time that I was accepted into law school. Like most students, I had no money to go to school. However, I looked at it as an investment. I borrowed money. I went to law school, built a successful practice, and paid the money back. I had a more stable career. I put a great deal of money back into the tax system, and I created jobs.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270787">The investment we make in our infrastructure today is analogous to the decisions that individuals and families routinely make. Many Canadian cities are currently experiencing infrastructure backlogs. With the lowest debt-to-GDP ratio of any G7 country, there has never been a better time to invest in building roads and institutions that will keep our economy strong. We have historically low interest rates, currently hovering around 2.5%. This compares with 6%, 15 years ago; 10%, 25 years ago; and 18%, 35 years ago.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270788">Equally important is the need to boost our economy. We know that in many parts of this country there is a dire need to infuse capital to kick-start the economy. Our current commitment to infrastructure does just that. It takes advantage of historically low interest rates, infuses capital into our economy, creates jobs, and secures important, much-needed infrastructure projects for our future. We are allocating $11.9 billion to build infrastructure that we need now, and to make long overdue repairs to aging systems.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270789">On public transit, we are putting $3.4 billion toward phase one of our government's plan to improve public transit in Canada. Public transit opens doors to employment and educational opportunities that are not possible without it. Investment in public transit not only provides a quicker way for people to get around, it helps to equalize the playing field for urban Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270790">I represent a riding with high youth unemployment. I know that improvement in our public transit system will pay dividends over the coming years to our youth and our community.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270791">In addition to these historic investments, our government has committed $3.4 billion for affordable housing, community centres, and child care centres. These funds will ensure our communities are better places to live and provide more low-income Canadians of all ages with peace of mind.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270792"> All of these investments will start to provide an immediate boost to our economy and will better the lives of Canadians in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="214189" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge Park</Affiliation> and across this country.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270793">I am particularly proud of our post-secondary institutions strategic investment fund. Budget 2016 plays a major role in supporting post-secondary institutions in Canada. We have allocated $2 billion in additional funding that will be matched by the provinces and territories, to build and update research labs, training facilities, and on-campus incubators. These investments will ensure that Canadian post-secondary institutions remain leaders in innovation and research.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4270794">I am proud to say that my riding is home to the University of Toronto, Scarborough campus, and to Centennial College, both hubs of learning in Scarborough. I am pleased that our <Affiliation DbId="214338" Type="4">Minister of Science</Affiliation> was at Centennial College in Scarborough last week to announce the post-secondary institutions strategic investment fund. Many university and college presidents, student groups, and community members were in attendance. We were mesmerized by the incredible demonstrations of talent by Centennial College students, who have the key to the collective future in new technology, the new jobs that we often speak of.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270795">The University of Toronto Scarborough campus has a master plan, which principal Bruce Kidd and members of the Scarborough team shared with the members of this House. The master plan supports the renewal of Scarborough as a region. I believe the post-secondary institutions strategic investment fund will greatly support UTSC in our region and escalate the much-needed development that will lead to a more educated workforce, more equipped scientists, incubation of new businesses and technology, and ultimately more jobs.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270796">As an example, this January 29, I had the privilege of taking part in the opening of the new environmental science and chemistry building at the University of Toronto. It is a magnificent structure. It uses 40% less energy for a building of that size and meets the coveted LEED gold standard. This building houses world-class researchers, and Ph.D. and other graduate students. They are looking to help us. As countries address issues such as global warming and greenhouse gas emissions, the output from this building will help us develop the technologies, policies, and workforce to build the green economy of the future, an economy that can grow and help the middle class.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270797">Let me now turn to our historic investment into indigenous communities. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has made it abundantly clear that there is no relationship more important to him, this government, or our country than the one with our first nations, Métis, and Inuit peoples. I note that this morning the Supreme Court of Canada expanded the definition of Indian under the Indian Act to include the Métis nation and non-status Indians, in the Daniels v. Canada decision. In effect, our investment in indigenous communities is even more pressing today.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270798">Two days ago, our House debated the most recent suicides in Attawapiskat, and the broader issue of suicide in indigenous communities. This is yet another tragedy, but sadly not unfamiliar to those who live in these communities. We know there is no easy fix, and we know that money alone will not fix this problem. However, we know that the long-term solutions exist if government puts its energy and resources to it. Five hundred years of colonization, oppression, and failed policies cannot be undone overnight. The devastating news that we hear from many indigenous communities is a reflection of this history.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270799"> Budget 2016 will move forward with the goal of renewing the relationship with our indigenous peoples. I believe this budget will serve as a down payment to resetting the relationship. Though programs announced in budget 2016 will not solve the long-standing problems overnight, it is the first step to ensuring that some day soon all indigenous children will be able to have the same hopes, aspirations, and opportunities as any other child in Canada. To this end, budget 2016 proposes an investment of $8.4 billion over five years, beginning in 2016-17, to improve socio-economic conditions, education outcomes, and the well-being of our indigenous population. This investment is a significant increase over funding that would have been made available under the Kelowna Accord.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270800">Of this funding, $2.6 billion is earmarked for improving on-reserve education, including funds for special education and first nations language education. There is $634 million earmarked to improve child welfare, and $1.2 billion is to be allocated toward social infrastructure, with a focus on health and housing. These are investments that our indigenous communities desperately need right now. They will provide youth with the opportunity to build their communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270801">Boil water advisories are common in many first nations communities, and we are earmarking $2.24 billion in water and waste water infrastructure.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270802">The spending cap, as mentioned earlier, is a very important challenge that has faced first nations communities. We will remove the spending cap after a number of years where this has stagnated the growth and the needs of indigenous communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270803">In conclusion, this budget is one that we should all be incredibly proud of. It invests in our future and the future of our children. It is a statement on who we are as a people, and it opens a new chapter in the relations with our indigenous population. Budget 2016 is a truly inclusive approach to governing Canada, and it will pave the way for the prosperity of all Canadians well into the future.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The situation has been highlighted by the legislation it has just introduced on assisted suicide.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Anandasangaree" id="8860458"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="214189" Type="2">Mr. Gary Anandasangaree</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4270806">Mr. Speaker, I believe we are now six months into a four-year government.

This budget is extremely important to allow growth and prosperity to the middle class.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270817">My speech will touch on three major areas: investment in the middle class; our relationship with indigenous people, which is extremely important; and of course the historic investment in infrastructure, which would see growth and prosperity in the near future.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270818">During the campaign, I met a gentleman named Tyler in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="214334" Type="2">Sackville—Preston—Chezzetcook</Affiliation>, and in talking with him, I realized the challenges he had. He was making a modest income, he had three young kids, and his wife was a stay-at-home mom, supporting the children. With that income, it is quite challenging for families. When we look at how items in the budget could support Tyler's family, it is quite impressive. </ParaText><ParaText id="4270819">By that I mean that the Canada child benefit program would see $1,116 per month going toward the support of his family and some of the challenges of the costs. That represents $13,400 of tax-free money. There is no question that this budget would make a big difference to his family and many young families across the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270820">There are many families out there, some who are even more vulnerable and have even more challenges, and this budget would support more than 300,000 families and pull them out of poverty. We would also see nine out of 10 families benefiting from this budget.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270821">It is very obvious that this is a major investment in the middle class. Studies have shown in the past that, when we invest in young families early, it reduces the costs to government in the future. That is the type of government we have here.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270822">The second point I would make is about our indigenous people.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4270823">I would like to talk about indigenous people and the challenges they have been facing for far too long. What is really impressive is that this government is going to invest in these communities because they have enormous challenges. Past governments of all stripes did not really invest as much as they should have, and that is why this budget is important.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270824">What kind of investments do we have here? The government is going to invest $8.4 billion to support indigenous people. Furthermore, I am pleased that it will invest $2.6 billion in education. This is vital for primary and secondary education on reserves.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270825">It is very important to note that only 36% of indigenous youth graduate from high school, compared to 72% for the general population. As we can see, this is a very serious situation that must be addressed. That is what this government intends to do. There is also a great need for renovations to school infrastructure in indigenous communities. This money will also be used for that purpose. Furthermore, an investment will be made to provide access to clean drinking water and improve health services and the quality of education. As we know, education is probably the most important thing we can give young people. This investment will help them develop their skills and also help them return to their communities to make a contribution, which is key for any group of individuals.</ParaText><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4270826">I would also like to talk about the tax credit for teachers, which is extremely important. Many teachers use their own personal money so that they can add equipment or material to their classrooms. I see this happening often. I have personal experience. I am a teacher, my wife is a teacher, and my two daughters are teachers. This tax credit of 15% would be a big piece to support this initiative, up to $1,000 of course. It recognizes the investment made by teachers and the hard work they do for students across Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270827">For the last part of my speech I would like to talk about the infrastructure investment. When we talk about infrastructure, people think right away about bridges and roads, but the investment in infrastructure by this government is about more than that. It is about social investment, digital investment, and environmental investment. These are much larger categories and would help a greater number of people.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270828">Let me talk about social infrastructure. Many communities in my riding require affordable senior housing. This would ensure that seniors stayed in their own communities where they could see their children and their grandchildren grow. That is important. Statistics Canada has indicated that Nova Scotia has one of the oldest populations in the country. The needs in my riding of Sackville—Preston—Chezzetcook are extremely important.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270829">As well, we are seeing investments for veterans. Our government would reopen the nine veteran offices that were closed by the past government. We owe a deep debt of gratitude and appreciation to all veterans for their service. This is one small step, but we are going in the right direction.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270830">Also, with respect to digital infrastructure, rural broadband access is important in my riding and across Canada. I have participated in the rural community caucus, which has clearly announced that broadband is a top priority. Our government would invest $500 million over five years in this budget for high-speed Internet, which would allow small rural and remote communities to thrive and provide people with the necessary equipment for the challenges of the 21st century.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270831">I am working on many major projects in my community: for example, the Burnside-Sackville expressway, the dredging of the inlet in Eastern Passage, the Aerotech Business Park, and so forth. What I like about this budget is that the categories would be set now for us to take advantage of and get these jobs done. It is extremely important that every member in the House, not just Liberal members, has access to these types of categories to help the people in their ridings. </ParaText><ParaText id="4270832">It is a nice feeling to stand here today and know that we are seeing steps toward what we promised to our constituents in this budget, and many of the things we promised are going to get done. Over the next four years, we will see many more great things happen to help and support all Canadians.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Dreeshen" id="8860650"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="213887" Type="2">Mr. Earl Dreeshen (Red Deer—Mountain View, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4270833">Mr. Speaker, I too am a teacher and I understand the significance of the extra costs associated with making sure classrooms are adequately supplied.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270834">The member mentioned a specific group of people who would gain a tax credit, but the tax credit for the group he mentioned has been taken away.

That tax-free money is a lot more, almost $3,000 more, than any family was receiving. Those monies will enable families to invest in different types of sports programs and have support for the costs of these items.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270839">The income-splitting question is a good one, because the individuals the member is speaking of would be making a lot more money.

It shows not what the government said it would do, but what it is really willing to do and where it is really putting the money. The Bloc Québécois is taking this process very seriously.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270852">We want to be absolutely sure that we are speaking on behalf of Quebeckers and that we understand their needs and support them in getting the tools they need to address the challenges they face. That is why we met with about a hundred groups of people from all walks of life, people from cities and the regions, people involved in social and environmental work, workers, students, seniors, and the unemployed. We cast a wide net so that we could accurately convey what Quebeckers want.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270853">Not everyone agreed about everything, of course, but we were surprised at the strong consensus on one important thing: Quebec is not Canada. Our challenges are not the same, our economy is not the same, and our way of doing things is not the same either. Everyone agrees that Ottawa needs to take that into account.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270854">We have identified four key priorities. The first one involves protecting our public services through transfers. Second, we need to rebuild our infrastructure through a flexible, effective program that allocates money quickly so that we can meet the needs and boost the economy. Third, we have to take care of people, particularly through employment insurance, which was systematically gutted in recent years. Lastly, we need to reinvest in the economy, but not in a foolish or haphazard manner. Those investments must meet the needs of the Quebec economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270855">Since we are proactive, we even offered some suggestions for obtaining additional revenue: taxing banks and cracking down on tax havens. This budget is zero for four. It provides nothing for transfers, nothing meaningful for employment insurance, nothing to suggest that the infrastructure program will work quickly and effectively, and nothing to meet the needs of our economy. The budget does not meet any of Quebec's specific needs, either socially, economically, or fiscally. We will therefore be voting against this budget.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270856">Of course, the budget does contain some interesting measures. Investments for indigenous communities are long overdue. The federal government's record when it comes to indigenous issues has become a disgrace. Many indigenous people are living in third world conditions. The needs in terms of housing, health care, education, and public safety are overwhelming. </ParaText><ParaText id="4270857">The crisis in Attawapiskat in the past few days has brought to light the sense of abandonment that these people feel every day. Therefore, we applaud the investments that were announced in this budget. Clearly, putting money on the table is not enough. We must meet the needs of indigenous peoples and listen to them. They must be real partners.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270858">It is in the Liberal DNA to centralize decision-making in Ottawa. Quebec knows a thing or two about that. The nation-to-nation approach that the government announced in its throne speech, and that it refuses to use in Quebec, I would add, should be more than just a slogan. Our indigenous brothers need more than money. They also need respect for their differences and their distinctiveness. Otherwise, things will not change. The Indian Act, with its colonial approach, treats them like minors. That law must go.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270859">There is also the new child benefit, which is another attractive measure. We want to see the law before giving our full approval, but I find it attractive, more generous than former programs, non-taxable, and better targeted to those who need it. It remains to be seen how it will be harmonized with Quebec programs.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270860">The OECD finds that Quebec has the best and most original family policy in North America. Our people do good things. A consistent family policy is an effective family policy. Financial assistance from both levels of government, child care services, and parental leave all have to be coordinated. No one should ever fall through the cracks because two government programs are poorly coordinated. </ParaText><ParaText id="4270861">Now that the budget has been tabled and the government has to come up with a program, Ottawa needs to sit down soon with the Government of Quebec to adapt its program to our specific reality. Unfortunately, that is where the fine words end. For the rest, it is disappointment after disappointment.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270862">First, let us talk about transfers. If there was one thing that became quite clear during the pre-budget consultations, it was the need to restore transfers to a level that ensures the viability of the Government of Quebec and the sustainability of the public services that depend on it.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4270863">Of all the governments, the federal government has the most room to manoeuvre. As it provides almost no services, it will not feel the impact of the aging population, particularly on health care. Unlike the provinces, whose deficits are recurring because they are structural, the federal government runs a deficit because of a temporary economic slowdown. Economic conditions aside, the trend is clear. The parliamentary budget officer, the Conference Board of Canada, and the Council of the Federation agree that in 20 years, Ottawa will be on track to pay off its debt, while the provinces will be in an untenable financial situation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270864">The scope of these financial problems goes beyond Quebec. It is the status of province that is not viable. These prospects are quite worrisome. In fact, unless there is harsher unending austerity, Quebec will all but implode.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270865">Health care costs have increased by more than 5% a year, on average, in the past 10 years. By reorganizing services to increase efficiency, Quebec is hoping to limit this increase to 4.4% in the future. The 6% annual increase in federal health transfers was a start in helping Quebec get caught up. After hitting a low of 18% as a result of severe budget cuts by the Liberals at the end of the 1990s, Ottawa now contributes 22% of costs. We are very close to reaching the 25% target set by the Romanow commission, which was put in place by Ottawa. Unfortunately, the Conservatives put a stop to the increase as of next year. At the end of the plan, the federal government's share will have dropped to 18%, the same as it was during the worst years. However, things will be even worse, as a result of the aging population. Everyone in Quebec has been critical of this. We need to continue getting caught up. The government needs to continue increasing transfers by 6% a year, until Ottawa is once again responsible for one-quarter of the system costs. Since this is intended to cover health care costs, the allocation must also take needs into account. It does not make sense to allocate the funds automatically, on a per-capita basis. We need to take seniors into account. What is there for seniors in the budget? Nothing. The Liberals are maintaining the Conservatives' cuts. Quebeckers would be better off getting used to austerity and wait lists. This government just confirmed that those times are not over.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270866">It is not just health transfers. Quebec's future depends on its young people. Transfers for education and social programs have not even begun to catch up, as if education and child care services were not important. The government was asked to increase transfers by 6% per year until they got back to the same level as before the cuts that were made in the 1990s. That would represent nearly $900 million a year for Quebec. What is in the budget? Nothing.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270867">As I said earlier, the federal government provides almost no services, and when it does, it does not manage them very well. What the Liberals and Conservatives have been doing with employment insurance for the past 20 years is outrageous. EI was supposed to be an insurance program, but it has turned into an employment tax. Rather than providing workers with insurance for when they fall on hard times, the government is charging them extra taxes. The government has let workers down. It has put women, young people, and seasonal workers in dire straits. They have had to go on welfare because they are not eligible for EI. Ottawa is treating seasonal workers like fraudsters. The government is forgetting that it is not the workers who are seasonal but the jobs. Like everyone else, these honest citizens still need to eat 12 months a year.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270868">There is not a lot of tourism in the Gaspé in winter. Not a lot of construction either. Trying to pave a road in the middle of January is impossible. Trying to find a teaching position in July is impossible. These people are not fraudsters; they are the very people for whom employment insurance was created during the depression in the 1930s. People everywhere told us that they wanted the government to restore employment insurance, which has been gutted. That is what we asked for. Employment insurance must once again become what it should never have stopped being: insurance. The system must once again be accessible and independent. Ottawa must stop dipping into the fund as though that money were its own.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270869">Is there something about this in the budget? Precious little. Ottawa reduced the waiting period, which is good. However, it did nothing to make the system more accessible or to extend the benefit period. What is worse, Ottawa is extending benefits in regions where the economy is tied to oil production, but not anywhere else. Montreal's unemployment rate is higher than Calgary's, but the government is extending benefits for Calgarians only. Seasonal workers in the regions are worried. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4270870">Benefits run out at this time of the year, yet there is nothing for them. We have gone from having a broken system to having a system that is broken and unfair. That is not what I would call an improvement.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270871">Let me say a few words about infrastructure. The federal government is currently contributing roughly $1 billion to Quebec's infrastructure through the various building Canada plan programs. That funding represents only roughly 5% of public infrastructure spending in Quebec, while the Government of Quebec covers the other 95%, including for health, education, and the municipalities. Needless to say, the additional investments announced by Ottawa are welcome. However, it is not enough to just put money on the table. The money needs to be made available quickly and the programs need to be flexible enough to meet the needs on the ground, something that only the authorities in Quebec City and the municipalities can determine.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270872">The experience with the 2009 infrastructure plan is instructive. Ottawa wanted to interfere in the choice of projects, which made the whole process unending: 27 months to conclude a framework agreement that opened the door to studying the first projects, followed by negotiations, project by project, for 15 months on average. It took three and a half years before money was released from the federal treasury, which meant the program had to be extended. The same thing happened with the 2014 program. The money was frozen in Ottawa because of federal-provincial squabbles caused by the federal government's attempts to interfere.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270873">If the government really wants to have more money available to fight the economic downturn now, it must not repeat the same mistakes. The only federal infrastructure program that works well is the federal gas tax fund. The provinces receive block payments, and Quebec and the municipalities jointly select the projects to be funded. It is simple, quick, and effective.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270874">What did the government present in its budget? In its new programs, the Liberal government decided to keep doing things the same old way, even though it is not working, rather than doing something that works. By all indications, the municipalities are once again victims of the bickering between Quebec and Ottawa that will have federal interference paralyzing the process for months, if not years, even though the needs are urgent now. </ParaText><ParaText id="4270875">Worse still, the community infrastructure funds that will pay for projects like community centres, cultural infrastructure, and social housing were incorporated into the propaganda funding for the 150th anniversary. Will municipalities and community groups be forced to spread federalist propaganda in order to access funding? This feels just like the Liberal sponsorship scandal all over again. By all indications, these programs, as they are now, will be completely ineffective, and the municipalities will not see one red cent of the money promised for a very long time.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270876">This brings me to economic policy. The government said that it wanted to reinvest in the economy, that it wanted a more sustainable economy. We agree. When the Conservatives were in power, all they cared about was oil and western Canada. Look where that got us. Now it is Ontario's turn to reap the benefits of federal largesse. Once again, Quebec is being ignored.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270877">The Quebec economy is different than the Canadian economy. People often forget that. Canada has a subsidiary economy, particularly in the oil and auto sectors. Protecting head offices is not a Canadian priority. The country's economy is not terribly innovative, and its businesses do relatively little R &amp; D. </ParaText><ParaText id="4270878">Things are different in Quebec. Quebec accounts for 45% of Canada's technology exports. Quebec entrepreneurs invest 50% more in research than their counterparts in Canada. That information is from Statistics Canada. Quebec has an aerospace sector and a multimedia industry. Quebec has renewable resources like hydroelectricity and forests. That is Quebec, and federal policies must reflect that.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270879">I was surprised to see the level of support for an economic policy that meets our needs among all the people we heard from in the pre-budget consultations. On the left and on the right, in urban and rural areas, there must be support for business innovation. We must support investment, especially since the weak petrodollar makes production equipment more expensive. We need a real aerospace policy that supports our major players, who are world leaders. We cannot say it enough. We need programs that support our SMEs, which are also innovators. What we need is a real innovation strategy.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270880">Quebec has a 21st-century economy. Our strengths lie in sectors that will grow in the future: technology, the environment, renewable resources, and culture.

Hedy Fry (Vancouver Centre, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4270925">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased and proud to stand here and support this budget.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270926">I know everybody is listening to thousands of pieces of information about programs here and there, but the big thing about the budget is that it invests in two important things. It invests in the economy and creating jobs, and it invests in people, helping Canadians have more money in their pockets spend, to afford to do things they need, and to cope. For me, these two key issues are very important.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270927">First and foremost is the economy. We need to invest in the economy now. We have had a stagnant economy and not very good job creation over the past 10 years. Everything has stayed steady because we have depended on one commodity only to float the economy and jobs, and we have seen what has happened. We have no control over global markets, and oil prices have gone down.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270928">We are trying to diversify the economy, not only by investing in natural resources, of which we have a lot, but also by investing in the 21st century economy, creativity, and innovation. To do that, we have to reinvest in those areas that have been ignored for quite some time.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270929">We want to kick start the economy now so it can start moving and then develop a long-term economy. Therefore, we are investing immediately in infrastructure.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270930">As members well know, we are investing $11.9 billion in infrastructure, which is phase one. I want to point out that this budget is not the only and final budget this government will bring in. This is our phase one budget. When we invest in infrastructure, we are investing in green infrastructure, looking at waste water, encouraging electric vehicles, simple things like that which will move us forward. </ParaText><ParaText id="4270931">We know that infrastructure brings jobs and gets people working immediately. Therefore, we are building roads and bridges. Road and bridges have to take our people, goods, and services across the country to ports and areas in which we can move them around the world. It is an important investment. For public transit alone, we are talking about $3.4 billion over three years. </ParaText><ParaText id="4270932">Also, what most people do not understand is that from coast to coast to coast, ferries are important points of transportation. British Columbia will benefit from the 25% tariff being taken off of ferries. This will allow us to have bigger and better ferries, and to fix the ones we have right now. Again, when we can move our goods and services, that puts us into the competitive arena.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270933">We are also investing in is social infrastructure. We are investing in housing, which is the first part. Building new housing and renovating old housing is real work for real people, which will continue over the next five years and into the future. As the economy grows, we will see more building going on. </ParaText><ParaText id="4270934">We are talking about the spectrum of housing. It is not only low-income and social housing in which rent is geared to income, but we are also looking at building home care for seniors. We are looking at how we can work with provinces and municipalities to build affordable housing. Because of that, the affordable housing budget of Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation has been doubled.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270935">When the Liberals first brought in a national housing strategy back under Lester Pearson, CMHC was created. However, CMHC seemed to have lost its way in the last 10 years. Now we have now brought it back to do what it was supposed, which is to invest in affordable housing.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270936">Many Canadians and their children cannot afford to buy houses, and may be living farther away. However, investing both in housing and transit closes that loop. In other words, we can get them to work and back home in a faster period of time.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270937">We are also investing in the new 21st century economy. We are looking at investing in research and development, and science. We are looking at investing in areas such as commercializing our technology, which is a huge. We have universities that are second to none. They are coming up with important new discoveries, and the ability to commercialize some of that work is very important.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4270938">We developed the ebola vaccine here and we sold it, gave it away to a big company. We now have to buy it when we want it. That is not the kind of industry. We want to be a place where people can come here and talk about how we can develop good pharmaceuticals. </ParaText><ParaText id="4270939">Over the years, we have shown excellence in environmental medical technology. This is where good, well-paying, solid, environmentally friendly green jobs will come from and it will give Canada a name in the world as a niche market and a place when looking for this envrionmental technology.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270940">I do not know if many people know this, but we happen to be best for sound and special effects in film, not just in North America but in the world. Everyone is beating a path to our door because of our new ability to deliver sound and special effects. This creates jobs. These jobs start at $63,000 a year. We are not churning out people in film school fast enough to fill those jobs. Canada can excel in communications technology, film, arts and culture and be the place the world looks to when it wants to find excellence.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270941">We are looking at our ability to develop communications technologies, green technology and translational technologies. We are actually able to develop innovations in health care that we can commercialize to the rest of the world. Therefore, that translational research is very important. That is the kind of technology, the kind of new economy about which we are talking. That is where Canada can begin to excel. </ParaText><ParaText id="4270942">With regard to aerospace, we have McDonnell-Detweiler, the Canadarm, the ability to bring in things like CASSIOPE that can download and upload enormous amounts of information and time. RADARSAT, which Google and all of the world now uses to tell us who is on what street and how to get from A to B, is Canadian, developed in my province of British Columbia with McDonnell-Detweiler. Let us go back and gear to be excellent in certain things. When we talk about investment, this is an example.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270943">I am just reminded, Mr. Speaker, that I may be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="214236" Type="2">Parkdale—High Park</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270944">We are talking about that kind of investment in the economy, but the economy is not just an abstract thing. The economy is people. People are the ones who work, who produce, who make Canada competitive. Therefore, we are looking at how we invest in people so Canada can once again become a more productive nation and be competitive in a global economy. We have not been doing that very well. </ParaText><ParaText id="4270945">We are reinvesting in skills so people can transition from economies that are not doing particularly well to the new economies. Re-training people is a huge investment, and is an important for people in the workforce.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270946">Let us look at the young people coming into the workforce. We are now doubling the Canada student summer job program, with apprenticeship programs. By doubling it, every year 35,000 new students in university will be able to learn and train for these new jobs. This had been severely cut under the last government. We are bringing this back. We are telling students who come out of university that until they find a job that will pay them $25,000, they do not have to repay their loans.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270947">We are bringing in grants for students to go to university and stay in university, up to a thousand new dollars a year.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270948">We are investing in the fastest growing population in our country, which is the aboriginal people. If we recall, there was something called the Kelowna accord under a past Liberal prime minister, Paul Martin. It would have invested $5 billion over five years into housing, education and health. It would be administered by aboriginal people for aboriginal people in partnership with the provincial and federal governments.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270949">As soon as the last government came in, it was cancelled. That meant there were 10 years in which none of those programs were used, and aboriginal communities were 10 years behind in being able to participate fully in the economic, social and political life of our country. We have now brought it back. Ten years is almost a lost generation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270950">We had an emotional debate in the House about what was happening in Attawapiskat. This is not a new. It is because despair and hopelessness.

Many families do not pay that much in taxes to be able to get back that money.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270957">What we are trying to do is level the playing field by bringing in the child benefit. The additional money that families in the low-income and middle-income brackets are going to get will allow them to do those things for their children, enrol their children in sports, buy their children sports equipment and musical equipment now, today, and not wait for the end of the year, or never being able to afford it because they do not qualify for a tax credit.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270958">The important thing to remember is that the money we are giving is going to benefit nine out of 10 families in this country, low-income and middle-income families, and it will be tax-free.

The document was created after listening to what thousands of Canadians wanted to see from their government. It reflects the priorities of Canadians and embodies the real change that the people of Parkdale—High Park voted for on October 19 last year.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270973"> Today, I want to organize my thoughts around three central themes that infuse the core of this document: first, our government's commitment to a fair and more inclusive society; second, our objective of helping Canadian children thrive; and third, the goal of creating a long-term vision for Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270974">On the first theme, I came to this country as a Ugandan refugee in 1972. I was 10 months old at the time. My father, my mother, my four-year-old sister, and I arrived with nothing more than a couple of suitcases. However, we lived in a society where my sister and I, the children of working-class parents, had access to the same opportunities as everyone else. We were treated with respect and dignity. We were shown that no matter where we came from or how limited our means, we lived in a country where our success was limited only by our imagination and our capacity to work hard.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270975">However, over the last 10 years, the previous government systematically eroded the foundation of that fair and inclusive society, putting in place barriers to success and limiting rather than empowering people to reach their full potential.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270976"> I am proud that our new government is doing things differently. We are committed to restoring a fair and inclusive society</ParaText><ParaText id="4270977">First and foremost, as part of that commitment is repairing our relationship with indigenous peoples. Over the generations, that relationship has suffered from both passive neglect and active hostility. First nations, the Métis nation, and the Inuit do not enjoy anywhere near the same quality of life as other Canadians. With the 2016 budget, our hope is that this relationship can begin anew. Our government is taking its first steps by launching a national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women. Coupled with this, we are investing $8.4 billion over five years to create opportunities and improve the socio-economic conditions of indigenous people. Correcting this relationship and improving the plight of our first peoples is not only beneficial for the collective, it is also a moral imperative. I know that the residents of my riding know this as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270978">Organizations in Parkdale—High Park have already been taking action. I am proud of the work that Wigwamen has been doing in my riding to rebuild this relationship. Wigwamen is Ontario's oldest and largest urban indigenous housing provider, with 214 units throughout Toronto, including in Parkdale—High Park.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270979">Our commitment in this budget to fostering a fair and more inclusive society extends to protecting many of our most vulnerable. We are working toward lifting seniors out of poverty. Our government is restoring the retirement age from 67 to 65, and increasing the GIS that is provided for single low-income seniors by nearly $1,000.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270980">Budget 2016 also targets housing and homelessness. Our social infrastructure investments include $504 million over the next two years alone to construct affordable housing units, and $573 million to address repair backlogs in social housing.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270981">More importantly, this budget dedicates $112 million in the next two years alone to homelessness, which also includes much needed support for things that relate to mental health and addiction.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270982">Budget 2016 also strengthens protections for the survivors of domestic violence. Our infrastructure plan will allocate $90 million over two years for the construction and renovation of shelters and transition houses for victims of violence. Unfortunately, my riding is no stranger to this issue. For 23 years, the excellent staff at The Redwood shelter in Parkdale—High Park have been providing a safe and empowering space for women and children fleeing domestic violence. Notwithstanding its incredible work in our community, the need for safe spaces for women fleeing domestic violence in Toronto and other cities around Canada persists. This budget acknowledges that and works toward fulfilling that need.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270983">A fair and inclusive Canada is one that promotes access. Budget 2016 will also make the objective of post-secondary education more attainable by doubling the size of the Canada student grant for youth from low-income and middle-income families. </ParaText><ParaText id="4270984">We also know that helping people afford an education alone is not enough. We are committed to helping our youth transition from the classroom to the workforce by investing $495 million next year alone in the youth employment strategy. Again, the task of preparing our youth to succeed involves the community, and West Neighbourhood House in my riding has been contributing to this task for decades. Through the Toronto Youth Job Corps program, West Neighbourhood House in Parkdale connects youth to the workplace through employment, school, or training for young people between the ages of 16 and 29. It is helping kids who are out of school and out of work develop important life and employment skills that will help promote future success. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4270985">This budget's commitment to enhanced funding for youth employment reflects the fact that we value the work being done by entities like West Neighbourhood House.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270986">Helping our children thrive is the second thematic point. The task of positioning our youth to succeed and contribute to our collective well-being begins much earlier than the post-secondary education that I just referenced. Evidence shows that children who have a strong start at the beginning of their lives have a greater chance of success later on.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270987">Time and again at the doorstep, young families in my community of Parkdale—High Park told me about how difficult it is to raise kids in today's economy. I have two young boys of my own: Zakir is age five and Nitin will be two tomorrow. If I could be permitted a brief indulgence, Mr. Speaker, I would just like to say happy birthday to my little guy and that I will see him tomorrow.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270988">More importantly, as a father of a young family, I know that it is rewarding raising a family, but it is very challenging in this economy. Enter budget 2016. It will give Canadian families more money to help with the high cost of raising their children by replacing the current complicated system of child benefits with a single CCB, the Canada child benefit. It is simpler and it is more generous.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270989">Gone are the days of the previous government's universal benefits cheques sent to persons with seven-digit salaries who frankly do not need government help in raising their families. Gone also are the days when the previous government would issue a cheque, only for it to be clawed back by the taxman the following April.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270990">This new child tax benefit is tax-free, and it is targeted so that low-income and middle-income families will receive more benefits than those with the highest incomes.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270991">We campaigned on a very specific promise to deliver assistance to those that need it the most. This targeted Canada child benefit coupled with the middle-class tax cut that we passed on January 1 this year will do exactly that.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270992">Turning to the third point, we have a long-term vision for Canada that is encapsulated in this budget. Some of the aspects of that vision have already been articulated from the day we assumed office.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270993"> We believe in equality; hence, we have a gender equal cabinet. </ParaText><ParaText id="4270994">We believe in evidence-based policy; hence, there is the immediate reinstatement of the long-form census.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270995"> We believe in daring to name the danger of climate change; hence, we renamed the ministry, led in Paris at the COP21 summit, and invested $3.4 billion in this budget alone, for the next five years, to address climate change.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270996"> We also believe in compassion. A subject near and dear to my heart, we have accepted 26,000 and counting Syrian refugees into this country.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270997">With this budget, another part of our vision becomes clear. We believe in Canadian culture. The support in this budget for the CBC and other organizations that promote Canadian culture illustrates this.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270998">The residents of my riding include a large number of artists, writers, filmmakers, TV producers, musicians, actors and editors. They contribute to the culture of Toronto, and they are a huge economic engine for our country. We believe in cultivating that creative and economic engine, not impeding it. That is why this budget includes an investment of $1.3 billion over five years to support arts and culture organizations, including $550 million alone for the Canada Council for the Arts.</ParaText><ParaText id="4270999"> Our plan is not simply about promoting Canadian creative output, it is also about preserving Canadian cultural icons. Time and time again on the campaign trail and thereafter, the residents of Parkdale—High Park told me that, after a decade of neglect, to save the CBC. We have listened, and we have responded. Budget 2016 commits $675 million to the CBC over the next five years as a reaffirmation of the vital voice that CBC/Radio-Canada plays in our public discourse in promoting our two official languages and supporting our shared culture and values.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271000">In conclusion, this budget is transformative. After 10 years of neglect, this budget signals to Canadians that they finally have a government that is willing to invest in this country, in its people, in its institutions, and in its infrastructure.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271001">Most importantly, the budget illustrates our government's commitment to creating a more fair and inclusive society, and helping all Canadian children get the best start in life possible.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271002"> Budget 2016 crafts a long-term vision for this country that reflects our shared values, values like equality, compassion, and a commitment to evidence-based policy. I am proud of this budget, and I will be wholeheartedly supporting it. I urge all members of this House to do the same.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Aboultaif" id="8861144"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="214274" Type="2">Mr. Ziad Aboultaif (Edmonton Manning, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4271003">Mr. Speaker, that was a very detailed overview of the budget.

It is quite facile when we have extremely low interest rates and a debt-to-GDP ratio that is the envy of the G7. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271006">It is a prime opportunity to invest in the economy. It is something that we campaigned on during the election. It is something we are fulfilling with this budget and will continue to fulfill as we meet our overall infrastructure investment targets of $60 billion over the next 10 years. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271007">The statistics are already coming in from Stats Canada apropos my friend's question in respect to the job creation, which is already occurring and will continue to occur in this country because we finally have a government that is daring to invest in the economy when it is sorely needed.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Benson" id="8861148"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="213914" Type="2">Ms. Sheri Benson (Saskatoon West, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4271008">Mr. Speaker, I noticed in my colleague's speech that he spoke about the importance of helping those who need it most.

The only thing that is in common, other than the Prime Minister's signature, is to repair the relationship we have with our first nations communities. No one should underestimate or discount the level of commitment and prioritization that has been made in this regard.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271014">Just a few days ago, we had a very robust debate initiated by one the hon. colleague's members, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214564" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation>, about the deplorable conditions in which our first nations exist. We acknowledge that. We are working as quickly as possible to remedy that situation. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271015">Can more be done?

That is not the kind of politics we practise on this side of the House and it is not the kind of politics we are endorsing with the budget. To the contrary, we are endorsing a plan that will put more money in people's hands and make sure that it stays there so they can make decisions about it going forward.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Harder" id="8861197"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="214456" Type="2">Ms. Rachael Harder (Lethbridge, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4271021">Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214234" Type="2">Elgin—Middlesex—London</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271022">While I was pleased to see some measures, such as a short-term extension of employment insurance benefits for oil and gas workers in my riding and some investments in social housing, I found that the budget borrowed heavily from future generations, without a plan for job creation and without any sort of thought toward returning to a balanced budget. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271023">The budget borrows a lot of money. It will borrow $30 billion this year and over $100 billion over the next four. How can Canadians trust a government that has broken its promises right out of the gate? The government demonstrates an attitude of entitlement and an absolute disregard for the hard-working taxpayer. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271024">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has said he wants to place emphasis on our young people, but the only thing he is doing for our nation's youth is simply saddling them with a horrendous debt and thereby making it extremely difficult for them to move ahead in life after graduating from school.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271025">I have listened to union economists, Liberal politicians, and various pundits talk about how insignificant this deficit is, so let us talk about that.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271026">The budget borrows $118 billion over six years from future generations. To put that in perspective, the Bow tower, which is the tallest skyscraper in Calgary, cost $1.2 billion to build. This means that our present budget could build 100 Bow towers. That is 50 skyscrapers more than the entire downtown core of Toronto. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271027">The most worrisome part of the deficit is that there is absolutely no plan to eliminate it.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271028">I would like to take a closer look at the budget and what it means for the hard-working people of Lethbridge that I represent. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271029">First, let us look at jobs. I was saddened by the fact that there is no long-term vision to get Alberta's economy back on track. The budget confirms that the government is not interested in helping Alberta recover from a terrific downturn in the oil and gas industry and the loss of tens of thousands of jobs. The government's lackadaisical approach to job creation simply will not benefit anyone.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271030">I am both proud of and confident in the entrepreneurial spirit and strong work ethic of the people of Lethbridge. I represent thousands of small business owners who are smart, willing to take calculated risks, and eager to give back to the community by creating jobs. Small businesses are the heartbeat of the Canadian economy. They drive our innovation and entrepreneurial effort as a nation and they employ more Canadians than any other sector. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271031">During the campaign, the Liberals promised to lower taxes on small businesses. However, they have failed to come through. Our Prime Minister lied. This broken promise will cost small businesses across Canada a billion dollars a year, money that could have been reinvested to create jobs. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271032">Let us talk about families. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271033">Our previous Conservative government made families a priority. This was rooted in our belief that families are the fundamental building block of Canadian society. In order to pay for their new child benefit, the Liberals have eliminated the universal child care benefit, the children's fitness tax credit, and the children's art tax credit. Furthermore, the Liberals have also followed through on their threat to eliminate income splitting for Canadian families, an initiative that helped thousands of families in the Lethbridge region.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271034">The government claims that families will get more money under its child benefit plan, but when we look at it closely, we see the big picture: the middle class actually loses out. Parents understand better than government what is in the best interests of their children, but the budget removes choice from parents, limits options for families, and ultimately puts more power into the hands of government instead of the hands of parents. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271035">I was disappointed to note that the infrastructure spending proposed to trigger economic growth is already earmarked for big cities, in particular Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, and Vancouver. This appears to be a big-city budget that would do very little for a small centre like Lethbridge. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271036">Furthermore, there is little in the way of investing in rural areas. In my area, we have many roads and bridges in the county that have not been repaired or maintained since the 1950s. These roads and bridges are used each and every day to help get agricultural commodities to market, which is very important for Canada as a nation. Overall, the budget is in blatant disregard of our primary producers and ignores their needs, thereby ignoring the needs of Canada as a whole.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271037">I would like to draw attention to two other areas that I am quite passionate about. Those are persons with disabilities and our nation's young people. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271038">As in the Speech from the Throne, there is a glaring omission, and that is help for persons with disabilities. The only immediate item for people with disabilities is a small $2-million-a-year increase to the enabling accessibility fund, a $14-million fund that was created by the late Jim Flaherty. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4271039">This is in contrast to the Conservative budgets, which created new programs such as the registered disability savings plan and the Canada disability savings grant to help families save for the future of a child with a disability. As well, Jim Flaherty created the enabling accessibility fund in order to create access to public spaces by persons with a physical impediment. The Liberal government promised to introduce a national disabilities act, but this promise, like so many others, has not come to fruition in the 2016 budget.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271040">It is my sincere hope that in the coming years, the new government will actually meet with representatives of the community of persons with disabilities in order to understand the significant challenges that they face each and every day. I have had the immense privilege of listening to many of their stories and I am encouraged and amazed by their perseverance, resilience, and hope. I believe the Liberal government can do better—in fact, must do better—to build an inclusive Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271041">The Liberal government describes itself as a champion of young people. The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has expressed that he intends to prioritize Canada's youth, but the monetary lines in the budget simply do not match his rhetoric. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271042">That said, there are a few good things in this budget that I can support— </ParaText><ParaText id="4271043"><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!</ParaText><ParaText id="4271044"><B>The Assistant Deputy Speaker (Mr. Anthony Rota):</B> Order.

I support the intent of this project, because greater links between employers and post-secondary institutions are certainly needed. This would ensure that students receive the training and the skills that businesses are looking for in order to fill their current job openings. This would continue the trend of the Canada jobs grant and expand this approach to students.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271378">However, we need to acknowledge that this budget would significantly roll back previous tax benefits to students with regard to the measures the Liberals have taken. The ending of the education and textbook tax credit would have a significant impact on young Canadians, especially as they transition to full-time employment. The education tax credit was the greatest benefit to students as they started their career in the workforce, as it significantly reduced their income taxes, typically to zero, for the first few years after graduation. Eliminating this tax credit would mean that youth would have less money in their pockets when they were entering the workforce and struggling to establish themselves.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271379">Most alarmingly, the current government would saddle the next generation with a ginormous debt load.

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mrs. Vecchio" id="8861775"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="214234" Type="2">Mrs. Karen Vecchio (Elgin—Middlesex—London, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4271406">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to have you in the chair as I speak today.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271407">A local journalist from my riding always asks me what I like and what I do not like, so I am going to start off with a few positive notes of things that I saw in the budget that I do support.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271408">I am pleased to see the increase in GIS for single-income seniors. I have seen, over my years, many seniors who find it difficult, so any way we can help a single senior I feel is very important. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271409">I am pleased with the continuation in funding for broadband Internet, known as the connecting Canadians program. It is a great program that was introduced by the former government.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271410">As the MP for Elgin—Middlesex—London, I am happy to see $3.1 million being invested to address phosphorous levels in Lake Erie. This is very important, especially since we have 80 km of Lake Erie along my riding.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271411">However, today I stand as the official opposition critic for families, children, and social development. I would really like to focus on budget 2016 and the changes to the family benefits and their effects on Canadian families. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271412">I would not want to do this to the House, but I would have liked to bring in my beautiful pencil that my husband bought me, so I could do all these calculations. It is a brand new pencil and eraser, so I can complete, review, and compare the new Canada child benefit to the previous government's family tax cuts. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271413">Let us look at the facts. The government has said it would assist more middle-class families than the current plan assists. The biggest issue is that the numbers just do not add up. Reviewing the average family income using numbers provided by the most recent Statistics Can data, when I do these calculations, I see that six out of nine families, which are of average income for families, benefit from the current plan put forward by the Conservative government. This is better than under the new plan that would now be offered. Therefore, when we look at a simple tax return, it is truly clear that the headlines from the government mislead Canadian families. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271414">I will give a simple scenario. John and Mary have two children. Their son Jack participates in programs at a local recreation centre and plays on the house league soccer team. His sister Grace, age 4, loves to dance and swim and participates twice a week in programs. Both Jack and Grace play the piano and take lessons once a week. Mary works as a mechanic and John as a school bus driver. To me, those are very middle class incomes and values. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271415">With my new mechanical pencil, the federal tax form, and the family tax cut forms, using the previous tax rates, I calculated the following. The federal income tax forms for both John and Mary are based on the 15% and 22% respectively. I used the child tax credits for both Jack and Grace, as well as the arts tax credits. Finally, I used the income splitting for families, which increases the tax credit up to an additional $2,000. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271416">Now, to make things simple, because I did not want to get into a whole bunch of things, I did not use the CPP, I did not use the EI contributions, and I did not use the employment credits that are given, because both governments agree that these are things that are on a federal tax return. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271417">The bottom line is that the middle-class family has more money in its pocket through the Conservative government's family tax cuts. Also, because my new pencil had lots of lead, I completed more than 80 tax returns using the Liberal middle-class tax cuts with the new Canada child benefit, and I compared the scenarios. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271418">As I stated, when looking at the average income for Canadian families, six out of nine families did better under the Conservative plan. With this budget there would also be the removal of the textbook and education credit. That is before families would start paying directly out their pockets for the national carbon tax and the carbon tax being introduced by different provinces throughout the country. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271419">These same families I speak of include the same small business owners and the people who run our family farms. Employers would be paying more taxes in the future. The current government would cancel the small business tax rate. It would also be introducing increased contributions into public pension plans, by both employers and employees, after consultations. However, it also cancelled contributions into people's own personal tax-free savings accounts in December, and it has cancelled the hiring tax credit. These are tax increases to small businesses.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271420">I would be remiss if I did not talk about our local agricultural producers and farms. Ninety-eight per cent of farms are owned by families. During his speech, the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> encouraged farmers to produce energy if commodity prices have dropped. Although I appreciate that some communities may feel this is a great option, I live in Elgin—Middlesex—London, where this has become a big issue, especially at the provincial level. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="25">(1525)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4271421">I come from an agricultural community, and I have had the opportunity to talk with our grain and oilseeds farmers, as well as our beef, hog, tobacco, bean, lentil, apple, strawberry, pumpkin, and the many other producers. Farmers have really diversified. They have clearly stated to me that they need new markets and support for their industry. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271422">As the industry moves forward, we must support science-based research not only in Ottawa centres, but in the fields, and with the agricultural producers and agribusinesses. Over the next six years, we will see a $30-million investment into agricultural research in Ottawa. However, that is just a start, or I hope that it is just a start. We need to do more for our farmers.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271423">Finally, for all Canadian families, agricultural and small business owners, a huge deficit has been tabled. It will be these families and small businesses that will be footing the bill. For many Canadians, it is truly hard to fathom amounts like $10 billion, $20 billion, and $30 billion, as most Canadians only understand their own household debt. The government is treating Canadian tax dollars like Monopoly money. I like to play The Game of Life. My son always makes me play it. However, this is not a game. This is real money, and what we need is a vision, not just spending. Often when we speak in Parliament we use figures, formulas, and numbers that Canadians just are not in touch with. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271424">I believe there is a time for governments to participate in stimulus programs to grow the economy, as we saw with the stimulus spending programs of the previous government. We had shovels in the ground to build new roads, bridges, recreation centres, and much more, as well as an incredible investment into programs such as KIP, the knowledge infrastructure program. We saw universities like Western University, in the city of London, Ontario, improve the facilities for the Ivey Business School. This was great infrastructure spending at a time when it was needed most. At that time, across Canada, and especially in my riding where over 6,500 jobs had been lost just in the city of St. Thomas, investments were made that truly stimulated the economy and got people back to work. However, this is really not the time. We need viable options and opportunities to get people back to work. We need to spend wisely. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271425">As I said, I do see some positive things in the budget. However, first and foremost, the Liberal government is misleading Canadians. Important programs and tax incentives, like a fitness tax credit, do not just help families by giving them tax breaks, but they also help promote physical fitness. Although sports might not be everyone's cup of tea, the ability to compete and improve oneself is hard to challenge. My children have participated in sports, from swimming and getting their Bronze Cross to playing in house league soccer teams. Sports and physical fitness programs improve people physically and mentally. Why would the government cancel programs that encourage participation? If anything, I would have loved to see increases to these credits, especially for seniors. What the Liberal government calls boutique tax credits help seniors who are worried about their physical fitness purchase a gym membership or participate in activities. At the end of the day, these types of tax credits may help our health care system because there would be fewer people needing to use it.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271426">The arts credit is another excellent example. Music and arts programs are built on creativity and are linked to learning. The government likes to use the term “boutique tax credits“ when discussing these credits. We need to see not only how these credits improve people and put money in their pockets but also what they do for communities when people get involved with local recreation or sports teams. Sometimes small businesses also benefit. It is not only families that benefit but organizations as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271427">These are great programs and initiatives that help members of our communities participate, and I do believe it is important to support all families. The government's approach is not exactly what I would have hoped for, but I will say that some families will be helped. However, it was six out of nine times under the Conservatives, and only three out of nine times under the Liberal government.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271428">I do support helping single parents and families with disabled children. However, this budget is very misleading. I would suggest a universal approach with the universal child care benefit, fitness tax credit, arts credit, and income splitting. I think they are the best approach.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271429">I am truly concerned with the debt which seems to help families today, but in the long run it will be what they have to deal with tomorrow. These debts are as a result of the current spending. What happens when we get the bill? We need to look at these deficits.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271430"> I look forward to the further discussion on the budget in the House.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="30">(1530)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Long" id="8861853"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="214033" Type="2">Mr. Wayne Long (Saint John—Rothesay, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4271431">Mr. Speaker, John, Mary, Jack, and Grace came into my constituency office last week.

This budget is certainly a reflection of one of the reasons I got into politics; it is about reaching out to all Canadians, in a fair and balanced way, ensuring that they all have opportunities in this country. That applies to everyone, from the east to the west. This evening we will hear some interesting perspectives on the budget and how it is going to help Canadians from one end of the country to the other.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271457">I have spent a number of years in politics, and I can guarantee that in representing people in my riding, and before that in my district at the provincial level, it has not always been easy. It is not always easy to advocate for people, especially in times when governments are not tuned in, not listening to the needs of the people, and when they do not always see the big picture, a vision for the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271458">In the last number of years, people in ridings like mine that are remote, rural, northern, and indigenous, have not been listened to. When we look at the infrastructure deficit that we carry today, it is because there were governments in the country in the last 10 years that did not believe in many of these communities and many of these regions. These are regions that are northern, indigenous, remote, rural.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271459">I am very pleased to see a budget like we have today that is reflecting those needs and looking at the reality of what investments it will take to be able to meet some of those demands.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271460">Today as we speak, there is a budget coming down in Newfoundland and Labrador. I do not envy the job of the premier and his government, but I certainly have confidence in them to know that they will make the right decisions for the people in their province. They are carrying a huge deficit, and they have to make tough decisions. I am happy to say that I am part of a national government that recognizes this, and that has reached out in this budget to help provinces, like Newfoundland and Labrador, when it comes to creating jobs and new opportunities, to help provinces like Saskatchewan, Alberta, and many others.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271461">This year we were able to increase the transfer dollars to Newfoundland and Labrador, and we were able to ensure that there were increases in health transfers over those of previous years. We were able to see increases in social transfers over those of previous years. We were able to ensure that there was proper fiscal stabilization investments that would be transferred to Newfoundland and Labrador.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271462">It means partnering with provinces and territories. When a province is strong and its economy is strong, we all benefit. Our government is recognizing that. We are recognizing that, and we are partnering with provinces and territories to help them do the things they need to do to move infrastructure forward.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271463">The other thing we are doing is we are recognizing that the challenges they have need to be dealt with. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271464">Two years ago in my riding, under the former government, hundreds of people were laid off when the iron ore industry started to collapse.

There were thousands of people in this country laid off and unemployed under the former government, people who received absolutely no support, absolutely zero support.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="40">(1540)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4271466">We have been able to work with communities like Wabush and Labrador West so we can ensure that we have better employment insurance benefits for them to help them through the transition. We have been able to work with them in their communities and in the province to secure new investors and new opportunity. We have been able to put more money into investing in skills training and diversifying skill levels. We have been reaching out to communities in this way all across the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271467">We know that when we build stronger communities and when families have financial security, everyone contributes more to our country. That is why in our budget our government was adamant about raising the middle class, about allowing families to have opportunities and save for their children's future, to save for their retirement, and to be able to own a home.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271468">This is the kind of balance that our government has had to tackle. We have done a great job in targeting so many middle-income families and low-income families that really need the government to give them a hand up in society.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271469">That is why things like our child tax benefit program and our reformed income tax program will make a difference. In addition to that, we also realize that not all people live equally. We recognize that in northern regions the cost of living is much higher. That is why we included special initiatives within the budget to help.

For the first time in many years, we have given substantial increases under the northern tax reduction program, which will allow more families to have more money in their pocket to deal with the higher cost of living that they have to live with on a regular basis.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271472">For the first time ever, I listened to a budget that referenced not just indigenous people, or first nations, or Métis, but actually referenced Inuit people and referenced areas like Nunavut, Nunatsiavut, Nunavik, all of those areas about which we never hear much. They are referenced in the context of investment, in investing money into critical programs across northern regions. I represent a large area of northern Inuit people and for the first time we will get investments in housing. We will be able to provide better housing, better support programs, and a better foundation to help them build their communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271473">We have talked about suicide a lot in the House in the last few days.

Canadian democracy as we know it has been evolving over 250 years. If one considers the consensus-style government long practised by our first nations, then our democratic tradition has in fact been in place even longer than that. Therefore, for me to have this opportunity to add my voice to the long list of those who have gone before me in this continuing story of democracy is a truly humbling experience.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271491">I must also add that my sense of pride today is felt in double measure because of the constituency I represent. Winnipeg South is a community that epitomizes and crystalizes the very idea of what it means to be Canadian. From pre-contact times, the mighty Red River that flows through Winnipeg South was a trade route for Canada's first people. Our riding became a place where French explorers and indigenous people met, traded, and settled together, and French continues to thrive as a language of our daily life.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271492">Our part of Canada, in fact, created key pieces of a whole new culture unique to the world. The Métis people and Louis Riel's house, the site of national historic importance, is situated in Winnipeg South. Our community has, since those earlier days, welcomed immigrants from around the world, and continues to this day to embrace the spirit and the fact of Canadian multiculturalism. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271493">When I recently visited Fort Richmond High School in my riding, I was astounded to learn that the students attending that school could trace their roots back to 170 different countries. It is amazing. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271494">Winnipeg South is what Canada is all about, and I could not be more proud to be its member of Parliament. I thank the voters of Winnipeg South for the trust they have placed in me, and I pledge here that I will serve them faithfully.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271495">I am a Liberal because I believe government has a role to play in improving the lives of Canadians. In the election, the Liberals promised that, if elected, we would play that role in building our economy and our country. Now, with our new budget, the Liberal government is keeping the election promises we made to build Canada and make it a better place for all.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271496">For me, and particularly as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development, I am especially looking forward to helping implement the investments in social infrastructure we will make to ensure all Canadians have a chance to succeed. A key component of this approach is the investments we will make in affordable housing that were announced in this budget in the social infrastructure fund.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271497">Canada is a federation, as members know, and all levels of government need to examine how they can work together to best serve the interests of their constituents. I believe the federal government has a strong leadership role to play in ensuring that all Canadians have a home and a safe place to live. This budget provides that leadership. I am pleased to say that, through budget 2016 investments, we will work with our partners and the provinces, territories, and indigenous communities to address the most pressing housing needs in the short term.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271498">With new funding commitments of $2.3 billion over the next two years, budget 2016 represents a huge step in providing affordable housing for Canadians who need it most. Of the significant investments we will make in housing over the next two years, close to $1.5 billion of it will be delivered by the provinces and territories under the investment in affordable housing program, also known as the IAH. This will provide an immediate response to the most pressing housing needs in communities all across Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271499">It is important to note that these new investments are only a first step. A more permanent, longer-term approach is needed to develop an effective and made-in-Canada housing strategy. As these shorter-term measures are being implemented, we will carefully develop a comprehensive, forward-looking strategy that supports innovative approaches to affordable housing and improved housing outcomes for all Canadians and for all types of housing.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271500">To that end, we will consult with the provinces and territories, indigenous people, and other stakeholders in the coming year to develop a national housing strategy. More details on these consultations will be shared later this spring.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4271501">Another one of the promises we made during the election campaign was to create a new Canada child benefit, and I am so pleased to note that budget 2016 keeps this promise and proposes to replace the current complicated child benefit system with the new Canada child benefit in order to give Canadian families more money to help with the high cost of raising their children.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271502">This new benefit would provide a maximum annual benefit of up to $6,400 per child under the age of six and up to $5,400 per child for those aged six through 17. Families with less than $30,000 in income would receive the maximum benefit. Families would receive approximately $9.8 billion more in child benefits during the 2016-2018 period than they do now, and nine out of ten families would receive more in child benefits than under the current system.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271503">In my province of Manitoba, families would receive $490 million more in child benefits during the 2016-2018 period, and as the <Affiliation DbId="214678" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development</Affiliation>, I am gratified to say that the new CCB, as my hon. friend from New Brunswick has said, will lift some 300,000 Canadian children out of poverty and set them on the road to success. This is an example of the positive work that government can do to improve our society, and I am proud to play a part in it.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271504">In the last election, the voters in Winnipeg South had a clear choice between a Conservative government, which they believed represented the status quo and felt that the status quo was good enough, and a Liberal Party, led by Justin Trudeau, that believed the middle class deserves better.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271505">My apologies, Mr. Speaker.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Stanton" id="8862151"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="214863" Type="22">The Deputy Speaker</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4271506">I know the hon. member realizes that at this point he can, of course, substitute “the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>” or his riding.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

These assets include things like public transit, cultural and recreational facilities, green infrastructure that represents the economy of the future, universities and community colleges, as well as things like roads and bridges. A robust infrastructure is the backbone of a strong economy, and budget 2016's new spending will continue to build the things that Canadians want and need. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271511">This new spending will also create tens of thousands of jobs.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271512">I have mentioned only a few of the many things that our new budget will do to improve the lives of Canadians.

I welcome them all into this House. I am sure they will have a great time in this House over the next four years. We will debate many issues, many of which we will agree on and many of which we will not.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271538">For the new members of Parliament, let me give them a little history. I came here about 18 years ago. From that time, until October last year, every government had been fighting to balance the books. The previous Liberal government, under this <Affiliation DbId="214491" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s father, created huge deficits, and every government, including the Liberal government that preceded us, fought to balance the budget, to bring the books back into shape. We can all remember that the former prime minister, when he was the finance minister, cut transfers to the provinces to balance the budget, which no province has forgotten.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271539">Under the leadership of former prime minister Harper and finance ministers Jim Flaherty and Joe Oliver, we worked very hard to bring the finances back into shape.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271540">During the recession of 2008, when I travelled all over the world, wherever I went, I was asked all the time how Canada had not suffered from the world recession. It was because the policies we had were sound. We were not recklessly spending the money that we now see the present government doing in the budget of 2016.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271541">Budget 2016 is the first budget in the 18 years that I have been here where there is absolutely no control on spending, no control on any kind of transparency or accountability for Canadian tax dollars. What we have in this budget is a deficit. It started with a $10-billion deficit. Now it is a $30-billion deficit, with no plan as to when we are going to pay it. As it continues with the unplanned expenditures, we do not know where this deficit is going to end up.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271542">In 2008, when the world faced a recession, the G20 countries came out with spending on infrastructure to stimulate the economy. At that time, the Conservative government also went into deficit.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271543">For the present government to now say that it is bringing in infrastructure spending and all these things is something that the world economy has done. However, we are done with the plan, a plan to bring back and balance our books.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271544">The present government, despite the fact there it is very clear that when we left government there was a surplus, tends to mislead Canadians. It misled Canadians by saying that there will only be a deficit of $10 billion. It is misleading again to say there was a deficit when it came into power. It is utter nonsense.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271545">During the period that we were the government, I remember very clearly taking control of our expenses. We gave the departments and everybody an opportunity to see how they would reduce expenses to make it balance. That allowed us to cut taxes. We moved the taxes from early July to the middle of June for Canadian taxpayers. We reduced the GST to 5%. Now, with all this massive spending by the government, many people are asking whether the GST is going to go up. “Are they going to raise the GST?” It is a question that many Canadians are asking. Based on the past experience of the Liberals, we cannot trust what they are saying. It may go up.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4271546">Of course, we are facing a crisis right now of low oil prices, but everybody tries to say it is a regionalized issue in Alberta or Newfoundland. Today budgets are being presented both in Newfoundland and in Alberta. In all of them, they are talking about massive deficits. The oil prices are world-controlled, but let us make it very clear that everyone benefits from the energy industry. It is not only the few provinces of Saskatchewan, Alberta, or Newfoundland; it is everyone, including Ontario, and most importantly Quebec.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271547">Because everybody benefits, it is important that this energy sector now be given assistance, as we did when the automobile industry was under pressure. We came out with a program to help the auto industry in Ontario. It is the same thing, and today the energy sector requires assistance.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271548"> However, what do we have to do? It is very simple. We need to move our oil resources to tidewater, as everybody keeps saying. What is interesting is that the NDP government in Alberta has recognized that this is a vital thing for the economy of the country. The Alberta government is changing its tune and saying it needs pipelines to take oil to tidewater.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271549">The latest opinion poll shows that most Canadians agree that pipelines are the safest way to take oil.

They put in all these rules and regulations that can delay for years and years the project of making pipelines. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271550">The rhetoric that the other side is giving is that the current government streamlined the environmental regulatory process so that it would be a balanced process, not a process taken over by special interest groups, which the government seems to be representing all the time. We need to have the pipelines and the natural resources that this country is blessed with go to foreign markets. That is the key element of where prosperity would fly all across Canada for more jobs. Yes, we have infrastructure in the budget. We did that too, but there is no plan on that side. The parliamentary secretary was just talking about it.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271551">Canadians are extremely worried by this huge spending budget of 2016. They do not know where it will lead them. I can say that all of us will have to pay for this deficit.

Erin O'Toole (Durham, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4271572">Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today as the member of Parliament for Durham to speak in this important budget debate. What is most important about this debate is it is the first budget for the new Liberal government. It shows areas that it will focus on and as an opposition member, it shows areas that I am concerned about for our economic future. My remarks will be about that.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271573">I will start off in a manner that my mother always taught me to do. She used to tell me that if I did not have anything nice to say, then I should not say anything at all. However, I will say something. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271574">I was proud to see the government continue the legacy of Jim Flaherty, who recognized the unique strain placed on families dealing with young children with disabilities. I applaud the government for continuing the practice he started and for including extra support in its new child benefit for families with disabilities. I know first hand the late Jim Flaherty's passion on that subject and the impact it has had on families. The Liberals will continue that tradition and I salute them for it.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271575">However, with that out of the way, the budget is built on a house of cards. When the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was the leader of the third party, he did not support running a deficit. We have heard speeches from some of his brand new Liberal MPs, and I congratulate them on being here, but they do not know the position the Prime Minister took previously. For many years, he indicated the importance of a balanced budget. That was his position. That was the legacy he tried to take from Paul Martin and people like David Dodge. Members will hear them mentioned a lot. His position was that it was the responsibility of a government to keep a balanced budget.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271576">In the middle of an election campaign, really to take advantage of a weak position of a party on the left, the Liberals started saying that they would run a modest deficit of no more than $10 billion. In reality, there will not be a deficit lower than $10 billion over the course of four years. In the first two years, the deficit will be roughly $30 billion and around $14 billion in the final year. Not only does this break his promise about no more than $10 billion; it also breaks the promise about balancing the budget within his four year term. My remarks will show that some of that spending will have no long-term job creation impact on Canada at a time when that has to be a priority.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271577">The other house of cards is this. The budget is built upon an election document. All senior civil servants have essentially been given their marching orders from an election document. The Liberal government brought in a senior member to the Privy Council who wrote the election document. Had the last government done any of that, there would have been riots on the streets of Ottawa, but it seems to be acceptable by the Liberal team. The other fallacy was that Canada was in a recession and that was why the government needed to do it. That was not true. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271578">We saw that just a few weeks ago when job numbers and GDP numbers were announced. We would all like to see more jobs, particularly in Alberta and Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador, provinces that have been impacted by resource prices. The economy is growing modestly so the whole premise for running that no more than $10 billion deficit was also false. Why is that so important? Because it is building an economic plan for the new government that is built on a house of cards. The Liberal government is putting my children's future at risk by making poor economic decisions. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271579">A deficit in the midst of a global recession with a plan to get back to balance is prudent. A massive deficit during a time when the economy is growing with no real emphasis on job creation is reckless. In fact, very little of the infrastructure money will stimulate job creation. Most observers have been profoundly disappointed.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271580">I am happy there is some infrastructure spending, building upon the build Canada plan of the last government. However, virtually none of that spending will be stimulative, so there will be no jobs from it. There is no extension of the auto innovation fund or the parts innovation fund brought forward by the previous government to help Southern Ontario, to help areas in Oshawa and my riding of Durham, working with industry to modernize, to increase productivity, and to create jobs. There is none of that. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4271581">That is a broken promise on the job front to small business by reversing their position on the small business tax rate, another broken promise, in fact almost the unheralded or unheard of position of not meeting with the Canadian Federation of Independent Business and getting direct budgetary input amid the consultations the Liberals claim to have, I guess on Facebook, to help the hundreds of thousands of independent and small businesses in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271582">In fact, leading economists will say that amid those tough global years of the recession, it was small to medium-sized employers that helped us make it through, which was why the previous government had a strategic plan to do away with some regulation and red tape for small business, but, more important, make their tax rates competitive and incent them to hire. If every small business hired two people, that is equal to a new shift at a plant in Oshawa or Windsor, or more. Therefore, letting down small business and having no plan for jobs is a profound concern when running billions upon billions of dollars in deficit financing for Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271583">I will now speak for a few minutes about a few areas of particular concern. I am the public safety critic. It was shocking to have a budget delivered the day of the terrible terror attacks in Brussels. The finance minister was gracious enough to acknowledge that terrible attack on our friend and ally at the beginning of his speech, but with $30 billion in new spending, how much is there for front-line public safety and security? There is zero, nothing.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271584">There has been some talk about a few good initiatives such countering radicalization, those sorts of things, which the Conservatives support, even though we have not heard anything from the minister. However, there is nothing for front-line members of the RCMP, CSIS, CSC to keep us safe. That was very concerning, and the minister has not explained why.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271585">Now I will move to the Canadian Armed Forces. I am proudly wearing my RCAF pin. There was an RCAF reception on the Hill this week and I was proud that a lot of members attended. We have entered another decade of darkness.

At the outset, I want to let the House know how proud I am of this budget and how proud I am to be part of a government that believes in Canada, believes in Canadians, and believes in restoring hope and rewarding hard work.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271617">Budget 2016 focuses on growth, not austerity. It includes many measures that will grow the economy for the benefit of every Canadian. Investment is desperately needed, and it is needed now. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271618">Members need not take my word for it alone. The International Monetary Fund and the OECD have called on countries to make use of available fiscal room as an effective lever to support long-term growth.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271619">The strategic and smart investments in budget 2016 will strengthen and expand our middle class. They will reduce inequality among Canadians and, what I think is especially important, they will position Canada for sustained economic growth for years and years to come.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271620">The Canadian economy is bearing witness to dramatic shifts in the global economy, but these shifts present opportunities both for Canadians and for our economy. This is why we need a long-term plan for growth. There are no quick fixes, and significant investment is required. We will make these investments.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271621">This government listened to Canadians and took their input to heart. This budget was designed in part through extensive consultation with Canadians. I was pleased to participate in pre-budget consultations with my constituents in <Affiliation DbId="214121" Type="2">Newmarket—Aurora</Affiliation>. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271622">There are many elements of this budget that I am particularly proud of and will be speaking about today. I want to highlight four components of budget 2016: infrastructure investment, the Canada child benefit, support for seniors, and investing in arts and culture. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271623">Canada's middle class will benefit from the immediate help provided by budget 2016, but ongoing growth is equally important. By investing in infrastructure now, this government is delivering on its promise to support the middle class and to secure a future of economic growth.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271624">Infrastructure is crucial to our everyday lives. My riding has seen considerable growth recently, and the municipalities there need infrastructure investment. Without these investments now, economic growth is ultimately undermined. Congestion in Canadian communities makes life more difficult for busy families and has a negative effect on the economy. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271625">Together, investments in infrastructure and innovation will form the foundation of a more inclusive society. Through strategic investment, this government is working to help facilitate and create good, well-paying jobs that can help the middle class grow and prosper today and well into the future.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271626">Canadian businesses can only succeed when they have the tools to succeed. Budget 2016, by investing in infrastructure, goes a long way to support businesses across this nation. This means having better infrastructure to move products and get to work. It means having faster and more reliable broadband to communicate and reach customers, and it means having access to experts who can advise on how to develop businesses, including how to grow businesses globally.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271627">Another important component of this budget, of course, is the Canada child benefit. It is essential for Canada to invest in its children. Canada's existing child benefit system is complicated and is neither tax free nor income tested. This system is inadequate for meeting the demands of so many Canadian families, and it is not efficiently targeted to those who need help the most.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271628">Budget 2016 gives Canadian families more money to help with the high cost of raising their children by replacing the current complicated child benefit system with the new Canada child benefit. The CCB will provide a maximum annual benefit of up to $6,400 per child under the age of six and up to $5,400 per child for those aged 6 to 17. Families with less than $30,000 in net income will receive the maximum benefit.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4271629">With the introduction of a much better-targeted Canada child benefit, about 300,000 fewer children would be living in poverty by 2017. Let us think about that: 300,000 more Canadians who would have greater opportunity and, most importantly, more hope. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271630">The budget also has a good component for seniors. The government has made a clear commitment to improving the lives of all Canadians, and a key element of this commitment is improving the quality of life for seniors through strengthening public pensions and increasing social infrastructure funding for seniors' living. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271631">Canada's retirement income system has been successful in reducing the incidence of poverty among Canadian seniors. However, many seniors continue to be at risk of living in poverty. The budget has committed to increasing the guaranteed income supplement top-up benefit by up to $947 annually for the most vulnerable single seniors. It supports those seniors who rely almost exclusively on old age security and guaranteed income supplement benefits. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271632">Once again, I am proud that budget 2016 is supporting Canadians who need it the most. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271633">The challenges in affordable housing are something I hear from constituents in my riding, and it is an increasingly difficult barrier facing seniors. Through budget 2016, the government has committed to new social infrastructure investments that would be instrumental in increasing the quality of life for very many seniors. With real investments in construction, repair, and adaption of affordable housing for seniors, the government has committed over $200 million over two years to help provide this vulnerable population with access to the affordable housing that they need so desperately. Our senior population is growing, and our government understands that every individual deserves housing that is safe, affordable, and ultimately sustainable. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271634">In 2017, Canada and all Canadians will be celebrating the 150th anniversary of Confederation. Budget 2016 would ensure that our country's heritage is celebrated and shared. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271635">As many know, our cultural industries represent a key driver in our economy. Investing in the Canadian cultural sector helps to create jobs, strengthens the economy, and ensures that our unique Canadian stories are shared with the world. By investing $1.9 billion in arts and culture, budget 2016 would offer support to national institutions, safeguarding of our two official languages, and promotion of industries that highlight Canada's culture. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271636">Another announcement made in budget 2016 to celebrate this important time is the enhancement to the national historic sites cost-sharing program. This enhancement would include expanding the program to include heritage lighthouses and railways through the provision of $20 million over two years. Improving and restoring Canada's very important historical sites is something that is important to many communities across Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271637">The government will work with our partners to ensure that all Canadians will have the opportunity to participate in local, regional, national, and international celebrations. This celebration is an exciting opportunity for everyone to get involved and to showcase Canada's heritage, which has been shaped through one of the strongest pillars of our great nation, our diversity. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271638"> I am proud to support the budget, and I encourage all members of the House to support budget 2016. By investing in communities, in our children, in our seniors, and in our arts and culture, budget 2016 is a clear step toward a prosperous future. It offers immediate help to those who need it most and lays the groundwork for sustained, inclusive economic growth that will benefit Canadian families for years to come. When Canadians have more money to save, invest, and grow the economy, everyone benefits.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Blaikie" id="8862712"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="214129" Type="2">Mr. Daniel Blaikie (Elmwood—Transcona, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4271639">Mr. Speaker, today the government brought forward legislation that has to do with medically assisted dying.

I am honoured to rise in this place and speak on behalf of my constituents from St. Catharines, Ontario.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271655">I would like to begin today by saying that the provisions contained in budget 2016 would, without a doubt, deliver positive results for the people of my riding, the region of Niagara, and in fact all of southern and southwestern Ontario.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271656">St. Catharines is a vibrant and dynamic community, located on the shores of Lake Ontario in the north end of the Niagara region. The Niagara region itself is uniquely located within close proximity to four border crossings to the United States. For much of Niagara's recent history, this proximity to the United States has allowed for a sizable manufacturing industry to grow and flourish, providing many good-paying jobs and a healthy middle class.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271657">However, the last 20 years, and in particular the last 10 years, have not been kind to the region. As the world economy shifted away from heavy manufacturing, our region saw much of this industry close and move elsewhere. Thousands of Niagara residents lost their jobs or found new work at significantly lower wages, often in precarious employment. In my humble opinion, the economic policies of the last 10 years did nothing to help the people of Niagara. In fact, they made things worse.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271658"> Yet, there is in fact light at the end of the tunnel for the people of St. Catharines, Niagara, and all of Canada. On March 22, the hon. <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> presented to this House our government's first budget, a forward-looking, progressive economic plan that would finally put the focus of the national economy back on the middle class and putting Canadians to work.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271659">Throughout the election campaign, the <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was clear that we must refocus our national interest to the middle class that truly drives the economy and creates jobs. I am extremely happy to say that this budget would do just that and more for the people of my riding and the people of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271660">I was honoured to have the opportunity to rise on the first day of this 42nd Parliament to ask a question of my good friend, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214009" Type="2">Brampton North</Affiliation>. This question was on child poverty. I rose that day, having read in the newspaper that 24% of the children in my riding lived in poverty. That was a shocking statistic.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271661">What was even more shocking was when I went back to the riding and met with members of the non-profit community and was advised that it was a conservative estimate, and the number was probably closer to one-third.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271662">We are one of the wealthiest countries on earth, and this is not acceptable. Children in our country deserve to live without fear or wondering where their next meal will come from or where they will lay their head at night. Child poverty is a national issue, and must be front and centre in our national debate.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271663">This is why I am extremely pleased to see the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> announce the creation of the new Canada child benefit. I can say without hesitation that this improved benefit would most certainly help families in St. Catharines.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271664">The Canada child benefit would provide the residents of my riding and across Canada with a tax-free benefit that, on average, would give families an additional $2,300 to help make things easier. Our government committed to raising more than 300,000 children out of poverty with this new tax-free benefit. I believe with the passage of this budget, we would succeed in meeting our goal.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271665">However, combatting child poverty is only one of the key matters our government has committed to fighting. We have also committed to creating jobs and putting Canadians back to work. Our government committed to the largest infrastructure investment in Canadian history, and when the <Affiliation DbId="214320" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> tabled the budget, phase one of this investment was included.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271666">The minister conducted consultations right across the country, as I did in my riding. He met with municipalities, community groups, and everyday Canadians. The message was clear: now is the time to invest in our communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271667">However, as I have said locally to my constituents, infrastructure projects are no longer just buildings for politicians to cut ribbons in front of. The infrastructure spending that my riding needs and that we would deliver to Canadians goes much deeper than that.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4271668">We will invest in the social infrastructure of our society. Of the $11.9 billion we have committed to spend in phase one of our infrastructure plan, we would dedicate $3.4 billion to help low-income and middle-class families. This includes a firm commitment to expand access to affordable housing throughout Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271669">In St. Catharines and throughout the Niagara region, there is a clear lack of accessible and affordable housing. Low-income families can wait upwards of seven years for housing that is suited to their needs. Again, this is not acceptable.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271670">I am pleased to be a member of the governing party that will finally do something about this. It is unbelievable that the Regional Municipality of Niagara alone has an infrastructure deficit of approximately $235 million. If the federal government does not invest in our local communities, the region and municipalities will have to obtain funding on their own. Far too often, this will fall on local taxpayers to fund that infrastructure gap. We recognize that the federal government can do more to help municipalities and be a true partner for infrastructure renewal.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271671">I am incredibly proud to be part of a party and a government that is willing to invest significantly in public transit. As mentioned previously, Niagara is uniquely situated in southern Ontario. However, it may surprise members of the House to know that there is a fragmented and sometimes non-existent transit system in the region, with limited public transportation options to Toronto. I had an opportunity to meet with the president of the Niagara College student union, who advised me that he has to negotiate with eight or nine separate transit commissions in order to help move the students of Niagara College around the region.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271672">While there is some inter-municipal transit in urban areas in Niagara, there is still no concrete solution to help service the entire region equally, mainly due to the unique urban-rural makeup of Niagara. That is why I am excited to see this commitment by the finance minister to invest in public transit.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271673">It is also very interesting that, through the tenure of the previous government, much of our government-owned and managed infrastructure was left to fall into disrepair. Take, for example, small craft harbours. These small craft harbours are essential to the livelihood of many east coast Canadians. However, St. Catharines has a small craft harbour of its own in Port Dalhousie. While no longer an active commercial harbour, the piers that remain have significant historical value for the riding and the people. They pay tribute to the Welland Canal and the St. Lawrence Seaway, upon which the very city built its economy. For 100 years, they have provided a scenic haven for residents and tourists alike to enjoy a walk along Lake Ontario. However, they are now closed, shuttered from public access, because of the lack of needed investment by the previous government.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271674">I am very much looking forward to working with my friend and colleague, the hon. <Affiliation DbId="214337" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard</Affiliation>, as well as the hon. <Affiliation DbId="214314" Type="4">Minister of Infrastructure and Communities</Affiliation>, to ensure that the piers are given the consideration they deserve. The people of my riding and tourists alike deserve to have those piers restored in the manner they deserve.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271675">Historic investments would not be made just in our children, but in our seniors. Throughout the election campaign, I heard from constituents across the riding that we need to do more for our aging population. We would keep our commitment to maintain the OAS and GIS eligibility at age 65, cancelling the planned Conservative increase to age 67.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271676">Furthermore, the increased funding to the GIS would help 900,000 seniors in need. The minister was clear that we must do everything possible for our most vulnerable, and the increase of $975 annually would be welcomed by seniors in my riding.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271677">Contrast all of this to the last 10 years, when the government shied away from investing in Canadians and did nothing to expand the middle class. In fact, that government abandoned the middle class and focused our economy on the 1%. However, on October 19 Canadians made a choice to invest in jobs, grow the economy, and return focus to the middle class and those working hard to join it.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Cannings" id="8862808"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="214446" Type="2">Mr. Richard Cannings (South Okanagan—West Kootenay, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4271678">Mr. Speaker, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214512" Type="2">St. Catharines</Affiliation> talked in various ways about how we have to help Canadians who need help the most, and yet his government has proposed tax changes that would not help almost two-thirds of Canadians.

As has been stated many times, inside and outside of the House over the past six months, our energy industry has not had such a dramatic downturn in close to 30 years.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271698">When I was door knocking last fall, about on every street I would run in to at least one person who was unemployed as a result of the downturn. If that election were taking place today, I am sure that number would be more like two or three people on every street. In almost all instances, these were highly educated and highly trained men and women, many with young families. Many have moved into my riding over the past number of years from other provinces and from other countries. They did so with high hopes and high expectations for the future.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271699">“Hope” is a word that members will hear me refer to on many occasions in my few minutes this afternoon. It is a word that is important to the folks I just talked about, the next generation of CEOs, community leaders, and probably some political leaders. They were not expecting the budget to solve the current economic conditions, but they were looking for hope. The budget failed badly in that respect. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271700">The budget leaves each and every Canadian deeper in debt. It means more money for their children to eventually pay back, and there is a strong likelihood of higher taxes in the future. This is especially disappointing because many Canadians, including a lot more than I thought in my riding, voted for this <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> because he seemed to be giving them hope. Instead, it has been one broken promise after another, and the budget is more of the same.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271701">Instead of a $10-billion deficit as promised, this budget deficit is much higher, in fact three times higher. It is three times higher, not in a recession but in a growing economy. While Alberta is clearly in a recession, the overall Canadian economy is growing. However, the government is proposing to plunge our country a further $150 billion into debt over the next five years. Even worse, there is no plan to get out of debt.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271702">How can my constituents have any hope for their future? What could the budget have looked at that would have given some hope to my constituents? The government could have said, as an example, that all efforts will be made to get out of the way and let the private sector create jobs for the future. It is a simple statement, one that would have cost nothing, but it would have provided some hope. Instead, we have more regulations and more spending on government programs. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271703">We hear time and again from the government that running a huge deficit is necessary to creating jobs by investing in infrastructure spending. Now on the surface I could support those types of expenditures, but I want to break those numbers down a bit.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271704">The budget provides $10 billion over the next two years for infrastructure. When that money is spread across the country on a per capita basis, that means about $1 billion for our province over the next two years. In contrast, the infrastructure budget of the Province of Alberta over the last half dozen years has averaged $5 billion annually, almost 10 times what this federal budget is going spend to in Alberta on infrastructure. I have heard members across the way talk about it creating thousands and thousands of jobs. I think they are going to be in for a big surprise.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271705">Second, the government could have said it made a mistake by extending the timeline for a decision on pipelines and LNG projects. It was going to speed up the process so that a project that was approved by the National Energy Board would receive immediate cabinet go-ahead.

We can do it without a calculator. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271709">By the government's own admission, the average annual benefit to a middle-income couple—let us call them Kevin and Kelly—would be about $540. Stop and think about that for a minute. Three hundred and sixty-five divided into $540 works out to an extra $1.25 a day. Kevin and Kelly could not even go to Tim Hortons and buy a coffee for that price.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271710">I will conclude by saying that it was two years ago that I decided to return to public life. The Alberta economy was booming. We had a stable government in Alberta that was balancing the books and a solid Conservative government in Ottawa that was headed for a surplus after steering this country through one of the worst global recessions in 50 years. Optimism was everywhere. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271711">Today as I stand here, however, as the representative for Calgary Signal Hill, many of my constituents have been laid off, and fear and pessimism have replaced hope and optimism. As I stand in my place in the House to respond to the budget, an NDP finance minister is standing up at the same time in the Alberta legislature and presenting a budget with the largest deficit in the province's history, some $10 billion. How things have changed. However, I remain an optimist and believe that the economic situation in Alberta will improve, because Albertans are a creative and entrepreneurial bunch. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271712">There has never been a time in history when my constituents have had so little faith in their governments, both in Ottawa and in Edmonton.

At that time, the Conservative Party argued that running stimulus spending and deficits was critical for the economy of Canada, yet now he stands in this House and criticizes the Alberta government for running stimulus spending in Alberta. Premier Rachel Notley is showing that there is a way to have responsible resource development in this country while showing national leadership in terms of climate change and dealing with environmental protection.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271722">I think Albertans see there is a different way, because the Conservative government that Ms. Notley replaced was a government that failed to diversify that economy, as Peter Lougheed once said was so instrumental to that economy, and left the Alberta government and the economy in a very vulnerable position for a global oil collapse, which is what happened. That is the reason the Alberta economy is in trouble.

Michelle Rempel (Calgary Nose Hill, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4271729">Mr. Speaker, I understand I have about five minutes to talk about climate change.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271730">I want to reference page 149 of the budget, wherein the Liberals condense their approach to addressing climate change, with the main argument being, “Pricing carbon emissions will drive Canada’s transition to a stronger, more resilient, low-carbon economy and help Canada address the global climate change challenge.”</ParaText><ParaText id="4271731">When it comes to pricing carbon, we have to consider something called the price elasticity of demand. Basically, what that means is we have to look at whether, if the price of something increases, the demand for that product will drop. Something is considered price inelastic when, even if the price is increased dramatically, the demand for that product might not necessarily drop. Historically, one could make a very good argument that what research is out there shows that oil, and certainly gasoline, is fairly price inelastic in the short term and even in the long term.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271732">I have a question for the government, and I hope it will consider this. When it is looking at carbon pricing as a mechanism to address climate change, especially to address the targets it put in place at the Paris conference, will it look at whether or not the price that it is setting is actually going to have an impact on greenhouse gas emissions?</ParaText><ParaText id="4271733">I read an article in the January 22 edition of <I>The Globe and Mail</I>. I will not have time to quote from it as it is quite lengthy. It talks about how regional differences in our economies can in fact have different strategies on greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271734">I would caution the government that there is a large body of research—in fact, I was talking on Twitter the other night with Andrew Leach, an economist who had some involvement with the Alberta government's carbon pricing model—saying that it would likely be close to $100 a tonne that would be required as a price to have any sort of major reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271735">My concern is this. I am not advocating for a $100 price on carbon. Actually, what I am trying to say is I am not sure that even if the government puts a carbon tax in place it will have any real reduction in greenhouse emissions, any effect on that, but what it will have an impact on is people's pocketbooks.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271736">If the government is going to put a consumption tax on an inelastic good where there really are not substitute goods right now that would see a demand change over time, and I think that there is a good argument for that, the government should call it what it is. It is a consumption tax. All that a consumption tax on an inelastic good means is more revenue for the government and it does not really incent behaviour over time. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271737">A consumption tax does a few things. It disproportionately affects the poor, especially on an inelastic good, such as oil. It is going to affect low-income people disproportionately. People still have to get around. It is going to affect the cost of public transit. It will affect small businesses disproportionately, because they do not have the same capitalization as larger businesses to be able to overcome the effects of a tax.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271738">Again, it will not likely work. This will not likely see a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. It will create even more investment uncertainty in different parts of the country, especially in my home province of Alberta, where we are looking at investment certainty as something that we absolutely need. Some of my colleagues here have talked about how this is all based on low commodity prices, the issues that are happening in Alberta. That is not true. For the government to send signals, like new taxes, certainly is very bad timing right now. It is not actually going to do anything. It is going to put a chill on economic growth, because when people have to pay more for a good that they have to buy, they have to make choices on how they are spending their money in other areas. That is true for families, as it is true for businesses. If their tax burden is increasing, they are going to have to figure out how they are going to get money from other places to pay for the things that they need. I think that is going to put a chill on investment and a chill on economic growth.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4271739">My advice for my colleagues is simple. If they are going to look at carbon pricing and they are going to look at some of the rhetoric saying that a price on carbon of $140 a tonne is working in Sweden, what does that mean in the context of a regionalized economy in Canada where we do not necessarily have the same economic structures or the same needs from province to province? I ask the Liberals to really consider this so that they do not promise Canadians that they are going to lower greenhouse gas emissions and do not, and worse, make Canadians pay more out of their pockets for something that is essentially a consumption tax.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271740">If the Liberals want to raise taxes, which this does, then let us have a debate about raising consumption taxes, because Canadians would push back very strongly against that. That is a big concern I have with the budget. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271741">I wish I had a lot more time to talk about this very important issue. I wish I had 20 minutes.

These leaks give us some idea of the extent of the use of tax havens. It is enormous. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4271746">This week, the government was in a hurry to say that it was working hard to combat tax havens. Last year, the Luxembourg schemes were leaked. The year before that, it was documents from HSBC Bank. The year before that, it was UBS, and prior to that it was Singapore and the Virgin Islands. Every time, the Canadian government announced that it would work very hard to combat this issue. Before that, it was ships from Canada Steamship Lines, and before that, it was the Bronfman trust and the Irving family. The government has been supposedly working hard on this for 25 years. Clearly, we have yet to see any results.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271747">With each new scandal, the government announces new measures. However, this phenomenon continues to escalate. For 25 years, the government has announced measure after measure to catch cheaters. That is good, but it does not solve the problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271748">The crux of the problem is that it is perfectly legal to use tax havens. We cannot fix this problem by going after individual cheaters. We need to be going after the bad laws, the bad regulations, the bad treaties, and the tax system.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4271749">Barbados is a small, faraway country, but in 2014 alone, $71 billion left Canada and ended up in Barbados. That is more than the amount that originates from all of Asia and 12 times more than the amount that originates from France. This happens year after year.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271750">The colossal sums of money that Canadian businesses send there to avoid paying taxes are having a direct impact here at home. That tax-free $71 billion has a huge impact on government revenue. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271751">Since Quebec is not a country, it cannot sign tax treaties. Quebec's tax law with respect to international taxation is identical to the federal law. We simply have no choice. When the federal government allows the use of tax havens, the Quebec government loses revenue too.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271752">All taxpayers end up paying the price, whether they are in Quebec City or Ottawa or anywhere else in Canada. They have to pay more taxes and tariffs, and they have to cope with austerity measures. That is one consequence of our current status as a province.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4271753">For now, the key is the federal Parliament, so I would like to inform the House that, this morning, Quebec's National Assembly unanimously adopted a motion that is identical to the one we moved and are currently debating. Yes, it was adopted unanimously. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4271754">In Quebec City, every member of the Liberal Party, the Parti Québécois, the Coalition Avenir Québec, and Québec solidaire voted in favour of a motion calling on this House and the Canadian government to deal with the tax haven in Barbados.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271755">The fight against tax havens, and specifically Barbados, is something all Quebeckers agree on. I believe that may also be the case for the rest of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271756">International taxation is complicated. Every time organizations ask the government to do something to combat the use of tax havens, the government always says the same old thing, that nothing can be done, that this can only be fixed internationally, and that Canada would lose its competitiveness if it acted alone.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271757">Let me draw a parallel. The fight against climate change is complicated too. For 10 years, every time groups called on the Conservative government to take action, it always said the same thing, that nothing could be done and that this could only be dealt with internationally. We all know that was an excuse to do nothing.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4271758">Environmental groups were not asking to withdraw from international efforts. They were simply asking Canada to take action at home and clean up its own backyard. This is also the case for tax havens. We must take action at the international level, but also at home. It can be done, and that is the point of the motion. Barbados is Canada's tax haven. It is the second-largest recipient of Canadian foreign investments, even though it is just a tiny island. The so-called investments are nothing more than accounting tricks. There is no real activity down there.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271759">It was not a decision made internationally but a decision made by the Government of Canada that turned Barbados into Canada's tax haven. Furthermore, the decision was made without the consent of this Parliament. Parliament never supported the decision. We created the problem in this place, and it is here that we can put a stop to it. It is like environmental groups managing to fight climate change under the previous government. I want to show that we can take action in this place. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4271760">The motion offers a concrete, very specific solution. If Parliament adopts it, Canadian companies will no longer be able to use their subsidiary in Barbados to avoid paying taxes here. When they repatriate their profits, they will be taxed, quite simply, like any income for any taxpayer who cannot afford a creative and perhaps crooked tax expert. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271761">I am not saying that this motion solves everything. We will also need to work really hard on the international scene. We need to ensure that profiteers can no longer use the differences between the various tax systems to separate their activities and ultimately not pay taxes anywhere at all. Now is the time for some real progress in this area. All over the world, governments are having money problems. Austerity is affecting people more or less everywhere. People are starting to feel real indignation about tax havens. Tax havens are like a cancer that is destroying our societies.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4271762">We do not need to wait for the entire planet to come to an agreement. The biggest users of tax havens are banks. It is hard to get the exact figures, but we know that most of the money in tax havens is from the financial sector.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271763">Canada is able to act in a way that other countries cannot. The banking sector in Canada is protected. Banks are not subject to international competition. Canadian banks cannot move elsewhere. The Bank Act prohibits that, which means that Canada can take action against tax havens without hindering banks' competitiveness and prompting them to leave. In other words, Canada can do something.</ParaText>

They also introduced this into the regulations, in secret, without any debate in Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271765"> Section 5907, which is targeted in the motion, has to do with Barbados. However, it also has to do with 22 other tax havens. I remind members that this motion does not have to do with a partisan issue. Yes, in the past, the Liberals authorized the use of Barbados. Yes, in the past, the Conservatives authorized others. However, Parliament never authorized a single one. The House never once made tax havens legal. Never. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271766"> I remind all hon. members that there are no party lines when it comes to private members' business. For the purposes of private members' business, Liberal members do not represent the government any more than Conservatives members represent the former government. Here, we all represent the people. We have the privilege of being the spokespeople for our constituents. We are the representatives of real people who pay their taxes so that we can live in a better society.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4271767">Of course members do not all share the same values. The Conservatives want to lower taxes. Some Liberals and the New Democrats want to put an end to austerity. Regardless of our different motivations and values, I think that we can all agree on one thing: everyone needs to pay his or her fair share. There is no reason why white collar profiteers should be making off with money and hiding it in tax havens.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271768">I have not yet met any voter or any Canadian who is against this motion. On the contrary, what I am hearing is that we need to crack down on tax havens. What we need to do is to make changes to the regulatory framework to eliminate the loopholes that allow white collar profiteers to shirk their obligations.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271769">Today's debate puts the issue on the table. In June, there will be a second hour of debate and a vote. In the meantime, I plan on writing to every member of the House and meeting with as many members from all parties as possible. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4271770">I would like to remind members that the motion is meant to be non-partisan and that, this morning, all members of the Quebec National Assembly from all parties adopted a motion that is exactly the same as the one that I moved. This motion calls on Parliament, on the federal government, to resolve the Barbados tax haven problem. I would also like to remind members that Parliament never voted on the regulations that allow the use of tax havens. Never. Because of this motion, for the first time in the history of Parliament, members will be called upon to vote on the regulations that allow tax havens to exist. It will be the first time. Parliament never authorized the use of tax havens. Never. That is what it will be doing if it does not support my motion.

Through their efforts, innovation, and integrity, they are building a strong economy for today and future generations. They deserve to fully share in the promise and potential that Canada has to offer. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271794">We believe that Canada's tax system should reflect this fundamental principle of fairness. Our government is inspired by this vision in everything we hope to accomplish. It is based on the premise that everyone contributes their fair share and that everyone can benefit in return.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271795">Unfortunately, tax evasion and avoidance undermine this basic social contract. It comprises our ability to collectively support some of our most vulnerable fellow Canadians. It shifts the financial burden on to Canada's middle class, while inappropriately benefiting some who may be more than capable of paying their own fair share.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271796">This is why we have taken decisive action through budget 2016 to crack down on tax evasion and combat tax avoidance. Our budget will invest $444.4 million over five years to enhance the Canada Revenue Agency's assessment capabilities, through hiring additional auditors and specialists who will have the resources needed to undertake more comprehensive investigative work.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4271797"> However, we also recognize that assessing tax revenues alone is not enough. Once we assess these tax revenues, we then need to collect the unpaid amount. That is why budget 2016 is investing an additional $351.6 million over five years to improve the CRA's ability to go after and collect these outstanding tax debts. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271798">However, our efforts to support tax fairness do not stop at improved compliance and collection. Canada's tax system needs ongoing adjustment to ensure it is functioning as intended and contributing to the objective of an economy that works for everyone. Therefore, we will continue to take legislative and other actions to improve the integrity of Canada's tax system on both international and domestic fronts to ensure that.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271799">For example, we are acting on a number of recommendations from a multilateral project to address international tax planning arrangements undertaken by multinational enterprises to inappropriately minimize their taxes. We are also in the process of implementing the automatic exchange of financial account information to better combat international tax evasion.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271800">As well, budget 2016 takes action to address unintended tax advantages that businesses and wealthy individuals may be able to obtain through sophisticated tax planning techniques involving private corporations. I want to assure all Canadians that the government will continue to identify and address inappropriate tax planning schemes to ensure that the tax system operates as fairly and effectively as possible. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4271801">These actions are not just consistent with the basic principles of economic efficiency and responsible fiscal management. They are consistent with the basic principle of fairness that defines us as a nation. Tax evaders and avoiders would do well to take note of these initiatives.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271802">By improving compliance both domestically and internationally and from the underground economy, we expect to recoup around $2.6 billion in fairly owed revenues over five years. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271803">This is revenue that we will be investing in empowering all Canadians to build better lives for themselves. It will help strengthen and grow our middle class, and enable more Canadians to contribute to and share in the prosperity that our country has to offer. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271804">A strong and reliable federal revenue base is essential to the well-being of Canadians.

This is an important and timely discussion, part of a broader debate, about international tax avoidance that is taking place in Canada and around the world. The idea that all Canadians should pay their fair share of taxes is one our Conservative Party strongly supports. That is why we took a number of important steps in government to combat tax avoidance. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271813">Most significantly, we created the stop international tax evasion program aimed at reducing international tax evasion and avoidance. We are looking forward to working with the new government to continue building on our strong record in this area.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271814">With respect to Motion No. 42, the basic premise behind this motion is the condemnation of tax avoidance practices. Again, the idea that all Canadians should pay their fair share of taxes is one that we support. We do not contest the premise of the motion. However, what we do contest is the method employed in the motion to achieve its purported aim.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271815">The Bloc believes that implementing the motion would result in more money back in the hands of the Government of Canada. In reality, it is not so clear-cut. The motion would nullify the Canada-Barbados Income Tax Agreement Act.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4271816">The Canada-Barbados Income Tax Agreement Act was designed to limit double taxation, a situation where the same profits are taxed twice as they are earned in a foreign country and then again when they are remitted to the parent company's country of residence. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271817">Here is how it works in Barbados. Tax payable in Canada shall be deducted from the Barbadian tax payable on such income, profits or gains. In the case of a dividend paid by a company that is a resident of Canada to a company that is a resident of Barbados, which owns at least 10% of the voting power, the credit shall take into account the tax payable in Canada in respect of the profits out of which the dividend was paid.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271818"> In Canada, tax payable in Barbados shall be deducted from the Canadian tax payable on such income, profits or gains. For the purpose of computing Canadian tax, a company resident in Canada shall be allowed to deduct, in computing its taxes payable, any dividend received by it out of the exempt surplus of a foreign affiliate resident in Barbados.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4271819">Through the allowance of tax credits between particular countries, the international tax burden on companies and investors is effectively minimized. There is a general international tax principle that the country in which immovable property is located should have the right to tax the gains from the disposition of such property.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271820"> To successfully operate a foreign affiliate and legally benefit from the low tax rates available, the company must satisfy a set of regulations in place. These include both Canada Revenue Agency's demands as well as the local laws that govern IBCs.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271821"> The Canada-Barbados Tax Agreement Act was amended in 2011 to follow in the framework of the OECD treaty models and ensure holding corporations, trusts, or partnerships that held Canadian investments in real property and resource properties would be subject to Canadian taxation on sales of the shares of the holding company or the interests in the partnerships or trusts.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271822">The Conservatives believe that any motion to override the act's provisions should be regarded with skepticism. Why target specifically this act? Undermining an existing act does not seem to be the most appropriate response. Minister Findlay signed the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement, helping to set the stage for the automatic exchange of financial information with international partners.</ParaText>

Although efforts have been made by the current and previous governments, there is still much work to be done in several areas. Therefore, it is quite appropriate to raise the issue of Barbados today.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271828">It is fairly obvious that there is a problem with Barbados. We need only look at the numbers to realize it. My colleague mentioned a few. In 2014, $71 billion was invested in Barbados. Over the past 10 years, $390 billion has been invested there. It is the second-largest destination, after the United States, for Canadian foreign direct investment, ahead of the entire Asia and Pacific region. The reason is quite simple, and I will explain later.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271829">Why are such incredible amounts of money being invested in a country like Barbados, which has a population of 284,000 and a GDP of roughly $3.7 billion?</ParaText><ParaText id="4271830">In 2014, Canadians invested $71 billion in Barbados. There has to be a reason. I do not think it is because the sun is warmer than in the Cayman Islands or Hong Kong. There is a very simple fundamental problem: Canada signed a tax treaty with Barbados that prevents double taxation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271831">My Conservative colleague explained the rules. When someone brings back profits reported in a foreign country and Canada has an agreement with that country to prevent double taxation, the individual simply needs to prove that he has paid taxes in the original country so that he will not have to pay taxes again in Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271832">It makes sense to have an agreement to prevent double taxation with countries like the United Kingdom or United States, since this is fair for our businesses. However, Barbados has a tax rate of 0.25% to 2.5% for international companies, so it is clear why Canadian businesses are interested in investing there and reporting their profits there. Why pay 15% tax in Canada, or 11% in the case of small and medium-sized businesses, if you can get a better rate in Barbados?</ParaText><ParaText id="4271833">It is not surprising that $71 billion from Canada ended up in Barbados in 2014. That was handed over on a silver platter. It is not difficult to come up with such strategies, and they are completely legal.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271834">It is all well and good for the government to say that it will invest $450 million to go after cheaters, since everyone acknowledges that tax evasion is illegal, but all of that money will do nothing to prevent perfectly legal activities. How can we prosecute someone whose actions are legal?</ParaText><ParaText id="4271835">This is a serious problem. I thank my colleague for raising this issue. It is not a new one, but it is still very important.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271836">Earlier I said that tax evasion was simple. I do not want to encourage Canadians to engage in it, but I just want to make my point to parliamentarians.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4271837">Imagine that there is a company here in Canada with a subsidiary in Barbados. Obviously, the company hires a consultant to make things easier. There are consultants on every street corner in Barbados, and some in Canada too. The company hires a consultant who starts a company in Barbados in accordance with that country's laws. That company becomes a subsidiary of the Canadian company, which then becomes a multinational corporation. It is not difficult to conduct all of the business in Canada and then have the subsidiary in Barbados issue an invoice for $5 million, for example, for expert or advisory services, even if no services were rendered. The subsidiary will bill $5 million, which will be paid. Then, the company owner will declare in Canada that the year was somewhat but not overly profitable. In Barbados, the subsidiary will declare profits of $5 million or $4.5 million. The subsidiary will then be taxed in Barbados, according to that country's tax rate for multinational corporations. Obviously, if business is really being done in Barbados, that is legitimate. It is legitimate to have companies throughout the world, in Barbados or elsewhere. However, these corporations are not even taxed at such low rate in Barbados. It is therefore quite obvious that there is a problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271838">Just last Monday, the <Affiliation DbId="214329" Type="4">Minister of National Revenue</Affiliation> responded to journalists by saying that what the government also wants to work on is trying to make what is immoral illegal. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271839">She also said that if any changes need to be made to the legislation, they will be made.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271840">According to her, the trap is set. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271841">It seems pretty clear that something can be done in the case of Barbados. That is what my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="214211" Type="2">Joliette</Affiliation> is proposing today. Solutions are within our reach, for this is not the only possible solution. However, it is quite clear that the minister and the members of the other parties really need to take a serious look at this matter and the problem of Barbados. This situation could be resolved, although it is far from simple.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271842">As everyone knows, the NDP has always fought for greater tax fairness to ensure that our fellow citizens and our businesses pay their fair share. We are pretty fortunate in Canada. Our country delivers important services to Canadians, but someone has to pay for those services. Things like health care and education come to mind, for example.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271843">As more and more individuals and businesses try to avoid their tax obligations, our base will shrink progressively, and it will become harder and harder to pay for the services people expect. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271844">I can guarantee that when the people and the CEOs who engage in these immoral but legal practices have a health problem, they will not go to a hospital in Barbados. They will go to a hospital here in Canada. They will use our health care services. The first thing they will do is come here to take advantage of our good services, but the first thing they will do when they leave the hospital is continue to avoid paying their fair share for the services they received.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271845"> It is time to legislate a solution. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="214384" Type="2">Victoria</Affiliation> proposed a solution in the previous Parliament, and it still makes sense: it addressed the economic substance of a transaction. People would have to prove that there is real economic substance for a transaction, not just tax reasons. That is one solution, and there are other legislative solutions<Document DbId="6668096">.</Document></ParaText><ParaText id="4271846">Yes, the agency needs more resources. We do not oppose that. It is a good solution, but it does not solve the problem, which is purely a legal one.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4271847">We need tougher penalties and no more amnesty. That is another solution that still makes sense. When the agency finds that certain taxpayers have engaged in illegal activity, they should not be granted amnesty so they can avoid penalties and legal action.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271848">Lastly, there is no denying that international co-operation is extremely important here.

If someone had told me six months ago that we would be talking about tax havens in the House of Commons, I would not have believed it, but here we are.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271850">Tax havens and the tax system are not simple issues. It is a question of multinationals and taxation. We talk about international taxation, but that is not the right term. It is about how a government collects taxes on income earned abroad by residents or corporations of that same country. There is therefore no such thing as international taxation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271851">Today, I would like to go over the Canadian tax system and talk about how the budget will address this issue.

We currently have 114 tax treaties around the world. Barbados is one of these countries, as are several other countries with low tax rates or provincial regimes. The exempt surplus rules in the Income Tax Act and the income tax regulations allow active business income to be earned by a foreign affiliate.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271853"> So we have active business income. What does that mean? Basically, the test is that, as long as a corporation has five employees, it qualifies as active business income. That is the test. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271854">It has to be earned by a foreign affiliate. A foreign affiliate is a corporation of which a Canadian corporation has at least 10% equity. It is repatriated to the Canadian parent corporation as dividends without being subject to Canadian tax, provided that the foreign affiliate is resident in, and the income is earned in, a jurisdiction with which Canada has a tax treaty, such as Barbados.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4271855"> In contrast, active business income earned by a foreign affiliate of a Canadian parent corporation that is resident in a country with which Canada does not have a tax treaty is subject to Canadian tax when repatriated to the Canadian parent as dividends. So we have a foreign tax credit system. Basically, if there is no treaty it is taxed in a foreign jurisdiction. If the dividend is paid to Canada, we recognize and give credit to the foreign tax that was paid and then we tax that income in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271856">We have two regimes: if we have a tax treaty; and if we do not have a tax treaty.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271857">Budget 2016 would be a start to addressing tax evasion in Canada from Canadian corporations and individuals as well.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4271858"> Tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance by individuals and businesses entail a fiscal cost to governments and taxpayers, and reduce the fairness and integrity of the tax system. As a matter of fairness for all taxpayers, the government seeks to prevent underground economic activity and tax evasion and to close tax loopholes. Consequently, budget 2016 provides resources to ensure more effective administration and enforcement of tax laws and includes measures to improve the integrity of Canada's tax system.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271859">A key component is the $444-million investment over five years to help the Canada Revenue Agency, the CRA, do more to crack down on tax evasion and combat tax avoidance. This significant increase in funding will see examinations of personal income tax returns increase from 600 to 3,000 every year over five years. This large increase should generate additional tax revenue of approximately $400 million over five years.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271860">Furthermore, the CRA will hire more than 100 senior auditors and specialists to audit high-risk multinationals, which should generate even more revenue over five years. The CRA will also create a program to charge those who promote tax schemes, thereby increasing the number of files that the CRA can review every year to 200, which is 10 times the current number.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4271861">The number of auditors working on these schemes will increase sixfold, from four to 24. This is highly technical and highly specialized. This team will be able to conduct audits, apply penalties, and refer cases for criminal investigation, where appropriate. Furthermore, to make sure they deliver results, the CRA will embed legal counsel within the investigation teams. These lawyers will ensure that the cases are properly prepared and go to court as quickly as possible.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271862">Canada is also taking measures to protect the integrity of Canada's tax base internationally. First, Canada and other members of the G20 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the OECD, are working together to develop the base erosion and profit shifting action plan, also known as the BEPS action plan. This refers to international tax-planning arrangements undertaken by multinational companies to inappropriately minimize their taxes, for example by shifting taxable profits away from the jurisdiction where the underlying economic activity took place.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4271863"> As part of its commitment to protect the integrity of the Canadian tax base, the Government of Canada is acting on certain recommendations of the BEPS project in budget 2016. As we announced in our first budget, we are proposing new legislation to strengthen transfer pricing documentation by introducing country-by-country reporting for large multinational enterprises. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271864"> The Canada Revenue Agency is applying revised international guidance on transfer pricing by multinational enterprises, which provides an improved interpretation of the arm’s-length principle. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271865"> We are participating in international work to develop a multilateral instrument to streamline the implementation of treaty-related BEPS recommendations, including addressing treaty abuse. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271866"> The CRA will also undertake the spontaneous exchange with other tax administrations of tax rulings that could potentially give rise to base erosion and profit shifting concerns. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271867"> As for the future, Canada is committed to the BEPS project and will continue to collaborate with the international community to ensure a consistent and standardized response to the BEPS project.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4271868">Second, the government is working with its international partners to increase transparency through the automatic exchange of financial account information between tax authorities. The implementation of the new global standard in that regard, the common reporting standard, which was developed by the OECD, will help promote monitoring, combat tax avoidance and tax evasion, and restore public confidence in the fairness of the Canadian tax system. Right now, over 90 jurisdictions have agreed to implement this new standard.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271869">Finally, the ability of the wealthy to use private companies abroad to inappropriately reduce their taxes or defer paying them is another source of national concern.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271870">The fact that these people have money and access to clever accountants and lawyers should not excuse them from having to pay their fair share of taxes.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271871">Budget 2016 includes measures that respond to this concern and indicates that a review of the tax system will be conducted in the coming year.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271872">I can assure my colleagues that, in the future, the government will continue to identify and take action against tax planning schemes in order to ensure that the tax system operates as fairly and effectively as possible.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We need to talk about what tax rates are actually in effect in Barbados on international business companies. What we find is that on the first $5 million U.S. of profit the tax rate is 2.5%. That used to go down to a tax rate of 1%. However, as of 2013, Barbados has cut that all the way down to 0.25%. A quarter of a percentage point on profits over $15 million a year is what international companies pay in Barbados, so when the Conservative member for <Affiliation DbId="214366" Type="2">Brantford—Brant</Affiliation> or the Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="214213" Type="2">Sudbury</Affiliation> give us these textbook explanations about avoiding double taxation, we have to talk about what is really happening in Barbados. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4271877">Certainly it makes sense that if a Canadian company actually pays a decent amount of tax somewhere and then repatriates profits back home it does not again pay Canadian tax on that same money, and fair enough. However, is the position of the Conservatives and the Liberals in this debate that when a Canadian company pays a tax rate of 0.25% in Barbados that is good enough, that the company has paid its fair share of tax and it should not owe any more Canadian tax on that money? It seems that is what we heard from the previous speakers. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271878">There is absolutely a very serious problem of Barbados being a tax haven and it really does not make sense to exempt profits repatriated from that country from Canadian tax. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4271879">The next question is, how big a problem is it? Maybe there is a little loophole there, but if Canadian companies are not really taking advantage of it, we would not worry. The member for <Affiliation DbId="214027" Type="2">Mount Royal</Affiliation> tried to suggest that there are all kinds of different tax havens out there, so why focus on Barbados. I will tell him why. If we look at Statistics Canada's figures on foreign direct investment positions, we find that most of Canada's foreign direct investment is in the United States, as one would expect, but the second largest Canadian foreign direct investment position in the world is in Barbados at $71 billion. Why is that? Barbados is a pretty small country. Its GDP is something like $5 billion Canadian, so why would we be parking $71 billion in an economy of that size? </ParaText><ParaText id="4271880">We have not heard an answer to that this evening. I think it is obvious that Barbados is just being used as a tax shelter. Why would Canadian companies be investing more in Barbados than, say, in the United Kingdom, the third largest country for Canadian foreign direct investment? The United Kingdom, of course, has an actual economy and there are things there that corporate Canada might actually want to invest in. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4271881">There is a really big issue with Barbados. It is not to say there are not other tax havens, but clearly, Barbados is the biggest tax haven being abused by corporate Canada. We have to start somewhere and it makes sense to start with the biggest part of the problem. That is exactly what this excellent motion from my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214211" Type="2">Joliette</Affiliation> proposes.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271882">The third question that we need to address here is, what is the government doing about this very serious and very large problem? There was a lot of talk in speeches from the Liberals about all the good measures in the budget to deal with tax evasion. Indeed, the budget documents use the term “tax evasion” about a dozen times. It even uses the term “tax avoidance” about half a dozen times. A word that does not appear in the budget at all is “Barbados”. We are going to fight tax evasion without even talking about the largest source of tax evasion and tax avoidance. That is a very major problem, and that is the reason why members of the House need to vote in favour of the motion presented by my colleague from Joliette. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

							<ParaText id="4271892">I think members can understand why this answer was very concerning. The minister talked about the government's mandate, which the Liberals have been very clear about. They have said that they have a goal of settling long-standing land claim issues. That is an important goal, and we recognize that it is an important goal, but what she did not acknowledge is that as they go about that process, there will be an impact on people. It is really important to talk about that.

I can give a couple of examples: after the Tsilhqot'in decision, I received a very powerful letter from a man who is 70-some years old. He had a trap line and had invested a lot of money in his small business. Ranchers in northern British Columbia will be very significantly impacted due to a settlement of one of the treaties.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271894">The bottom line is the government is going to have to be proactive and absolutely deal with the long-standing issues, but it will also have to deal with private property rights and local community small business owners.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

							<ParaText id="4271917">The Saskatchewan Medical Association, which represents the province's doctors, is opposed to the two-tiered MRI system.

While this cost may be acceptable for some Canadians, it is virtually unaffordable for many more. Canada's health care system was designed as part of our social safety net to ensure everyone is able to access necessary exams.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271921">Canadians are proud of our universal health care system, but we must work to strengthen and expand it, not carve off pieces to be sold to the highest bidder. One of the driving forces behind the creation of our health care system is the principle that health care should be available to Canadians based on need and not the ability to pay.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4271922">For-profit clinics are only beholden to their owners' or shareholders' bottom line and not the well-being of patients. There is an inherent conflict of interest in allowing for-profit operators into a publicly funded health care system that seeks to provide medical services for patients, regardless of their income level.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271923">Just today, we heard about allegations that a private health clinic in Calgary is trying to pressure its doctors into giving preferential treatment to fee-paying patients.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271924">A two-tiered health care system only exacerbates unequal access for Canadians.

I am pleased to take part in this important debate and I wish to thank the member for raising this issue for debate at this time.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271930">Our government is committed to protecting our publicly funded health care system. Like all Canadians, we share the strong belief that all individuals deserve access to timely, quality, universal health care, regardless of their background, physical needs, where they live or how much they make. This is one of the core values of our country. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271931">Access to health care is an important matter for all Canadians. The Canada Health Act is more than Canada's federal legislation for publicly funded health care insurance; it is an integral part of our identity. The Canada Health Act preserves the values embedded in our health care system and in our country as a whole, values of equity, accessibility and solidarity. These are the values that make Canada one of the most desirable countries in the world in which to live.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271932">Not only do we have a health care system that all Canadians can be proud of, but it forms the bedrock of middle-class economic security. Our publicly funded health care system offers a competitive advantage for Canada in an increasingly competitive world. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4271933">The Canada Health Act requires provincial and territorial health insurance plans to provide medically necessary hospital and physician services to their residents on a prepaid basis and on uniform terms and conditions. Permitting payment for faster access to insured health services, including medically necessary MRI services at private diagnostic clinics, which has often been called queue-jumping, contravenes the accessibility criteria of the Canada Health Act. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271934"> Further, when patients jump the queue by paying to gain quicker access to a diagnostic service such as an MRI, they are then able to jump the queue a second time for any follow-up care indicated by the MRI. That means they gain faster access to both the initial diagnostic test and they gain quicker access to any required follow up surgery or procedures in the public system. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271935">This is not access based on medical need. This is access based on ability and/or willingness to pay, and it is a contradiction of the underlying principle of the Canadian health care system.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271936"> It is our belief that MRI services, when medically necessary, should be covered by provincial plans. I would like to assure the House that discussions are under way in relation to this issue.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4271937"> The strong support that our government has for our publicly funded health care system is echoed by the support of many Canadians. Polls continue to show that Canadians consider health care to be a high priority and that there is strong support for the principle of access to care based on need. In a September 2015 EKOS research poll, when asked if individuals should be allowed to pay extra to get quicker access to health care services, 64% of respondents disagreed.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271938">Canadians want a system based on need, and not their ability to pay. They consider equal and timely access to medically necessary health care services to be part of our national character, not a privilege of status or income. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271939">The hon. member may be assured that this government is committed to preserving the fundamental principles of our health care system and we will continue to work with provinces and territories to ensure access to quality health care services, based on need, not ability to pay.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Sporadic availability of truck transport imposes significant extra costs on the communities. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4271952">An expensive and uncertain transportation situation is a major barrier to all forms of development in northern communities. It brings food prices considerably up. It brings fuel prices up, fuel that is used for transportation and for heating on reserves. Medical supplies do not make it on reserves for the sick and health care workers who struggle to provide the care needed. Unsafe ice roads make it harder if not impossible for the RCMP and paramedics to reach those who require urgent help instantly.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271953"> As members can see, this is becoming a safety issue. There have been reports of trucks transporting provisions that have fell through the ice. Chiefs have also warned their communities to avoid the winter road as they are unsafe for travel.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271954"> This is not an issue that is exclusive to northern Saskatchewan.

I want to thank the hon. member for bringing this important issue to Parliament. I know it is a concern that is shared by her constituents.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271962">I live in a northern region of Canada, and I know the significant challenges that we face in winter when it comes to transportation, whether it be by air, ice roads, or snowmobile, which is the other preferred route that we have to use.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271963">I want to first of all point out to the member that in the budget there was $255 million for roads and bridges that was allocated directly and specifically for first nation communities. No community in the north, or anywhere in this country, should have to face a shortage of essential supplies during the winter. However, we all know that it happens.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271964">In my riding, as the member can appreciate, there are times of the year when we have to ship by vessel during a small window. It is not always easy to do that because of ice conditions, just like the challenges faced with reliable winter roads as well. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271965">The network is essential and vital to remote communities like the one the member represents, and we know how much they rely upon these ice roads for essential services like fuel, food, medical supplies. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4271966">We also know, and have acknowledged as a government, that the reliability of those transportation modes are being tested. In part, it is due to climate change, a discussion that we all continue to have. Environment Canada has told us that the average annual temperature in Canada has warmed by 1.6°, so that is significant. It also means a shorter winter road season for many of our communities. </ParaText><ParaText id="4271967">Typically, winter roads are open from mid-January to mid-March. Some can go longer, as we know. However, when the season is shortened due to weather, as we have seen in some years and in some communities like Wollaston Lake and Hatchet Lake First Nation, the communities that the member has referenced may have reduced access to the essential items they would normally receive by land.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4271968">There are systems in place, and I think the member recognizes that, to help these remote communities when these situations occur. For example, depending on a specific situation, Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada makes additional funding available to first nations to subsidize the delivery of essential items by air. We have done that in the past. We also monitor the number of days that we are expected to provide that service, and we look at what we can do early on to mitigate any impact that could be placed upon the communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="4271969">Our minister met with Chief Tsannie and the delegation from his first nation community regarding the winter roads issue.
