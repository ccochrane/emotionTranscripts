It is also a pleasure to do so soon after our nation came together as one to express its great pride and profound gratitude for what these men and women and their families did for our country.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474895">The outpouring of respect and admiration we saw from coast to coast to coast on Remembrance Day and throughout Veterans' Week was truly heartwarming and reassuring to me as Canada's Minister of Veterans Affairs. I have always believed that this support and recognition for veterans and still-serving members must extend year round, and the changes we are discussing today are another example of how our government is doing exactly that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474896">Before I turn to the specifics of the amendments before us, I would like to take a moment to talk about the reasons why we are proceeding with these changes and how they fit within our ongoing effort to help veterans and releasing members of the Canadian Armed Forces to make seamless transitions into civilian life. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3474897">As Minister of Veterans Affairs and previously as the associate minister of national defence, I have had the privilege to see personally and up close why the men and women who have worn our nation's uniform and those who continue to wear it reflect the very best of who we are as Canadians. I have been impressed by their skill and professionalism, their character and courage and their commitment to serve without hesitation or reservation. I have listened with pride and awe to their stories and experiences. I have been amazed by their modesty and have appreciated their frank discussions about the issues that matter most to them and their families. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3474898">One concern I have heard many times is the challenge some of them have faced, or are facing, as they make the transition to civilian life. Central to this are the difficulties some experience trying to start rewarding new careers.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474899"> We know that former personnel sometimes face barriers trying to demonstrate how their military training, skills and experience translate into the civilian workforce. Our government understands this and that is why we have been doing everything we can to promote veterans' skill sets to potential employers. That is why we were a founding partner and financial supporter of the Helmets to Hardhats Canada program that provides veterans with opportunities for employment and apprenticeship in the construction industry and why we launched our hire a veteran initiative in partnership with employers across the country to assist veterans in finding new and meaningful work.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474900">My department has been doing its part by specifically targeting veterans for hire by treating military experience as an asset in our selection process. Now our government is proud to take these efforts an important step further. Through our proposed amendments to the Public Service Employment Act and through changes to its regulations, we are moving veterans to the front of the line when it comes to hiring qualified Canadians for federal public service jobs. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3474901">With the proposed amendments before us, we will create a five-year statutory priority entitlement for Canadian veterans who are medically released for service-related reasons. This change will give veterans the highest level of consideration for jobs above all other groups in recognition of their sacrifice to Canada. With this change, we are recognizing that while these men and women have suffered injuries that prevent them from continuing to serve in the Canadian Armed Forces, they still have so much to contribute to our country. This is the right and honourable thing to do.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474902">Also, through changes to the act and accompanying regulations, full-time, regular and reserve force veterans who are medically released for non-service related reasons will see their existing level of priority extended from two to five years. This will also allow them a longer period of priority entitlement for positions they are qualified to fill. Simply put, these changes will offer qualified veterans the employment and career opportunities that never existed before for those injured and while they were serving as members of the Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="25">(1525)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3474903">What is more, we will extend these opportunities to Canada's cadet organization administration and training services and to Rangers by adding them to the definition of who is considered “personnel” with the Canadian Armed Forces.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474904">Finally, the proposed amendments we make to this legislation will be retroactive to April 1, 2012. This means that if a veteran previously had priority status under the regulations and that status expired during the past 18 to 19 months, we will reinstate it with a full five years. It is the same for those veterans who still have priority entitlement. We will extend that out to a full five years as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474905">We are doing all of these things because we believe veterans deserve such considerations and because Canada will also be better for it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3474906">For those of us who are fortunate enough to work with veterans on a daily basis, we understand that without these changes, we run the risk of continuing to lose the valuable contributions of highly-qualified individuals when they honourably end their military careers because of an injury or an illness. That is why we believe these amendments are common sense and that is why it is incumbent upon us to work in close consultation with key partners such as the Public Service Commission, the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat and the Department of National Defence, so Canada can continue to reap dividends from having invested in and supported veterans' military careers, ensure our nation's workforce is bolstered and enriched by the contributions veterans have to offer and, most certainly, at the same time continue to provide injured and ill veterans with the chance to keep serving their country and develop their experience and skills in a civilian capacity.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474907">The measures I have outlined today are yet another way we can continue to honour veterans in a meaningful and practical way and ensure they share in the wealth and security that they helped create.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3474908">To summarize, every year, many military members transition out of the Canadian Armed Forces. For those Canadian Armed Forces members who cannot deploy and meet the demands of operations, finding meaningful employment is a key factor in making a successful transition to civilian life.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474909"> When a position becomes open in the public service, different groups have different levels of access. In spring 2014, when this regulation is expected to come into force, those regular force and reserve force members who are medically released from the Canadian Armed Forces for service-related reasons will receive a statutory priority for a period of five years. This will provide veterans with the highest level of priority consideration for public service positions above all other groups in recognition of their sacrifices and service to Canada. This recognition will also apply to their families.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3474910">It will move veterans who are injured in the service of Canada to the front of the line. Those full-time, regular or reserve force veterans who are released for non-service related medical reasons will continue to receive their existing level of priority. However, the duration of their access will be increased from two years to five years, allowing them a longer period of priority entitlement for positions. Veterans who make use of this measure must qualify for the postings they are seeking. The changes will apply to medically released veterans who received a priority entitlement on or after April 1, 2012.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474911"> When I announced this legislation in Toronto, Shaun Francis, the chair of True Patriot Love Foundation, said:</ParaText><ParaText id="3474912"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The leadership skills, experience and expertise that our personnel develop in uniform is second to none, and makes them an invaluable asset to any new organization they choose to join...We are proud of our ongoing partnership with the Government of Canada to ensure that soldiers, sailors and air personnel can continue to build on the incredible commitment they have already shown to Canada.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="30">(1530)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3474913">In addition to the proposed legislative and regulatory changes, our government continues to work with corporate Canada to help veterans find new opportunities to successfully make the transition from military to civilian life. Partnering with corporate Canada allows veterans to put their training and skills acquired during their service to good use in the civilian workforce, while at the same time also providing a quality of life for themselves and their families. We also provide opportunities to train and upscale their abilities to better qualify for available jobs in the federal public service and elsewhere. We recently announced in excess of $75,000 for such training and upscaling. </ParaText><ParaText id="3474914">I would like to close by calling upon all members of this honourable House to lend their full support to these important changes and ensure that our men and women, who have given so much to our country and who are now becoming our veterans, receive their full entitlement and our respectful support for this proposal. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The minister mentioned in his speech that he is proud to be able to help veterans in their transition to civilian life through the Helmets to Hardhats program, which helps veterans find jobs in the construction industry.

They are unable to pay the rent at times, and so the poppy fund is stepping in.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474943">How would the minister ensure that this additional red tape on the release process—a process that already is backlogged, not working and costing our recently released forces members—would not make it worse for all the members who are leaving the armed forces?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Julian Fantino</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3474944">Mr. Speaker, we are absolutely allergic to red tape. We are trying to find ways to streamline all of the services and support systems to veterans. An example of that is the elimination of 1.2 million documents annually that Veterans Affairs Canada would have processed, and did process, with regard to expenses that were being incurred by veterans with respect to their very basic needs. For those who could not look after their own homes, Veterans Affairs Canada does that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474945">However, having said all that, we would not be increasing bureaucracy.

					<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Chicoine" id="8142372"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170160" Type="2">Mr. Sylvain Chicoine (Châteauguay—Saint-Constant, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3474947">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased today to speak to Bill <Document DbId="6284204" Type="3">C-11</Document>, introduced by the <Affiliation DbId="194615" Type="4">Minister of Veterans Affairs</Affiliation>. This is only the second bill since the Conservative government came to power. That is very little considering all the issues that have been raised, including in the ombudsman's reports, and the recommendations on how to improve the new veterans charter.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474948">It is a little disappointing that our government has so often ignored our national heroes over the past six years. The worst part is that the new veterans charter was supposed to be a living document, but the bill we are about to debate does not deal with the new charter. Contrary to what the minister was saying in response to the parliamentary secretary, the new veterans charter has not been routinely improved; it was improved only once. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3474949">When the charter was adopted in 2006, the concept of a living document meant that the charter would be amended as problems emerged. In the mission in Afghanistan, our troops suffered heavy losses. There were 158 deaths, and over 2,000 wounded soldiers came back, not to mention those who will be diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder in the coming years. According to a recent study, that is 14% of our troops, but we suspect that the number of injured soldiers and soldiers affected by stress is much higher. </ParaText><ParaText id="3474950">It is against that backdrop that the new veterans charter was adopted by Parliament on the condition that it be a living document. That meant that it was going to be amended a number of times if required, as needs arose, or if the charter proved to be inadequate, as has been shown by the issues and comments raised in the past two years. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3474951">Since they came to power, the Conservatives have not kept that promise. The charter was amended only once in 2011, by means of Bill <Document DbId="4751553" Type="3">C-55</Document>. After seven years, a minister has finally decided to review the new charter in its entirety. It is not official, however, because the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs has not yet begun the official review. As specified in Bill C-55, that study was supposed to have begun on October 4. Today is November 21 and the House adjourns on December 11, so we will have hardly any time to begin studying the new charter before the House adjourns for the holidays, and we will not be starting again until next February.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474952">That leads us to today's debate on Bill <Document DbId="6284204" Type="3">C-11, An Act to amend the Public Service Employment Act</Document>. Essentially, this bill seeks to give priority to veterans and members of the Canadian Forces who are released for medical reasons that are attributable to service. If, during the hiring process, the veteran demonstrates the essential qualifications required, the Public Service Commission will have to appoint that person in absolute priority, ahead of employees who are considered surplus or on leave. They will henceforth be in the highest category of hiring priority.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3474953">A second provision of the bill deals with the extension of the entitlement to priority, from two years to five. At the moment, veterans are in a regulatory category whereas public service employees are protected by the act. The government has therefore decided to include veterans in a category that is protected by the Public Service Employment Act.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474954">This is a noble gesture on the part of the government. However, like the measures it has taken previously, such as the Last Post Fund, and the reimbursements for training and post-secondary education, these are half-measures that will have little impact on the quality of life of most veterans.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474955">We will therefore support this bill at second reading, but we consider that it does not go far enough and that it raises questions that the government will have to answer. Moreover, in a climate of budget cutting, where we are seeing massive layoffs in the public service, this bill unfortunately will not really help veterans to get jobs in the public service, at least in the medium term.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474956">This bill is actually a reaction to poor human resources management. The Conservatives have laid off so many public servants that veterans are no longer successful in being hired from the priority list. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="50">(1550)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3474957">What is most disappointing about the measures this government has introduced is the little impact they have had. I will not start listing off everything from 2006 on. I will only go back as far as the last budget, tabled in 2013.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474958">The Conservatives announced with great fanfare that they were going to improve the Last Post Fund and double the refundable amount from close to $4,000 to a little under $8,000. An ombudsman, Patrick Stogran, had been mentioning this problem since at least 2009. The government waited some three or four years before addressing it. I would like to point out that it was a Liberal government that gutted the program in 1995 or thereabouts.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474959">More recently, the Conservatives announced that they were increasing aid for training and post-secondary education, with maximum funding of $75,800 per veteran and a maximum envelope of $2 million over five years. As they say, the devil is in the details.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474960">Although I do not know exactly how many veterans will apply for assistance under the program, let us take the amount of $2 million, for example, and divide it by $75,800, which is an accurate amount for someone going to university. If veterans receive the maximum amount, only 27 of them will have access to the program over this five-year period. Therefore, a little over five veterans a year will have access to the program.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3474961">I do not see how these measures will help our veterans. The Conservatives say they are increasing aid, but the criteria are often so strict that no one qualifies for it. It is easy to pull numbers out of the air and then make sure the criteria are so restrictive that the government will not be out of pocket at the end of the day. That is what the Conservatives are doing. They are using these tactics and saying that they are helping veterans, when what they are really doing is balancing the budget at their expense.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474962">Now there is this bill that gives veterans priority for appointment to public service jobs. At first glance, it is a wonderful measure. However, on closer inspection, this bill is much less attractive because few public service jobs will be available in the coming years.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474963">From 2006 to 2011, about 2,000 veterans made use of this priority entitlement. Of that number, 1,024 veterans secured a job in the public service. Of those 1,024 veterans, 739—72%—got a job with National Defence.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3474964">At Veterans Affairs Canada, the situation is somewhat more dire. Between 2006 and 2011, only 24 veterans got jobs at VAC, which corresponds to only 2% of all jobs.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474965">However, our veterans, who have experienced the difficulties involved in the transition to civilian life, should be ideal candidates for jobs at Veterans Affairs Canada. They should play a key role in the development of VAC policies to ensure that those policies are designed for them and meet their needs.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474966">The second-largest employer of veterans in the public service is the Correctional Service of Canada, which hired 54 veterans during that period, or 5% of all veteran hires. The Department of Human Resources and Skills Development is not very far behind with 44 hires, or 4% of the jobs obtained during this period.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474967">When we look at these figures, it is clear that not all departments are making the same effort to hire veterans. Indeed, most departments have hired fewer than ten veterans, while others have hired none.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474968">Therefore, these departments would have to undergo a major culture change to ensure that such measures actually help our veterans. As things stand right now, I am not sure that this will help even things out in terms of hiring more veterans in our public service.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3474969">The Ombudsman has found that about 4,500 veterans per year participate in vocational rehabilitation services. On average, 220 veterans put their names on list of those eligible for job priority status, and, as a result, 146 veterans on average get a job in the public service. This is a very small number. This does not make much of an impact on the majority of veterans or even on many of them.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474970">Moreover, the job priority status for veterans applies only to a very specific group.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3474971">The vast majority of jobs in the public service require bilingualism, a post-secondary diploma or even university education. Two to four years of experience is often also required.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474972">Under current regulations, veterans are given a two-year priority entitlement. The veteran must already have a diploma in hand because there is not enough time to start a university degree. Even now, with the new deadline, there is not enough time for a veteran to go to university, if he so wishes, and be available within the time prescribed.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474973">In addition, veterans who do not have a university degree are not overly interested in going to university for the extended period required. As I said earlier, 4,500 veterans participate in the vocational rehabilitation program each year. Only 63 veterans chose university-level programs; 32 received support from Veterans Affairs Canada and 31 received support through the service income security insurance plan. The other participants chose vocational training or college-level programs that lasted anywhere from 12 to 24 months.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474974">That number, 63, caught my attention. Is it true that only 63 veterans chose university-level programs, or are people being discouraged from choosing such programs because of the severely restrictive criteria?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3474975">The Ombudsman wrote the following in his report: </ParaText><ParaText id="3474976"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">While...Veterans Affairs Canada profess[es]  to consider the needs of the client/Veteran, they normally do not permit training or education in a new career field if, at the time of release...the client...has skills that are transferrable to the...workforce....</QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText><ParaText id="3474977">They are required to take a job that does not interest them or one that pays less than a career requiring post-secondary education, simply because they have skills.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474978">The government does not want to do anything that will cost a lot of money. That is the conclusion. In the end, it is not need that influences the decisions, it is the cost of funding education.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474979">The government is putting a lot of focus on the Helmets to Hardhats program, as though the construction industry were the miracle cure for job transition for our veterans. I agree, it is a good program, but it is not available in every province and it does not cover all trades. As I said, it is not available in Quebec, unfortunately. I have received calls from veterans who are disappointed that they cannot access this program because it is not available in Quebec.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3474980">I believe this restricts our veterans' ability to improve their quality of life and their job prospects. For example, the ombudsman recommends entering into partnerships with other industries and organizations, such as the Retail Council of Canada, the Canadian defence and security industries and the Aerospace Industries Association of Canada. We have to have more collaboration from private sector players, who are not always aware of veterans' skills. Unfortunately, human resources departments do not know how to interpret the CVs of military candidates. A recent study revealed the scope of the task. The Navigator study, conducted for the Veterans Transition Advisory Council in late August, found that most of the 850 employers consulted have little or no understanding of veterans' skills. Only 16% of employers make a special effort to hire veterans. </ParaText><ParaText id="3474981">Almost half of employers believe that a university degree is more important than military service when hiring. Only 13% said that their human resources department knows how to interpret a resumé from a military candidate. We have to do more in this regard.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3474982">To my mind, this bill has a major flaw. First, we have to remember that only Canadian Forces members medically released for service-related reasons will have access to the program. Previously, to be given priority, members of the Canadian Forces and the RCMP had to be released for medical reasons, whether they were service-related or not. That is also the spirit of the new charter. To qualify for Veterans Affairs Canada benefits and services, the injury has to be service-related. If the department ruled otherwise, the veteran could appeal the decision to the Veterans Review and Appeal Board and then the Federal Court. Unfortunately, this is no longer clear.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="00">(1600)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3474983">In addition, if a veteran needs to appeal a decision before a Canadian Forces tribunal or the VRAB, the procedures involved in these administrative tribunals can be very long. Does this mean that the duration of the priority, which begins the day the soldier is released from duty, continues to run out while these administrative procedures drag on? The ombudsman had this to say recently on his blog:</ParaText><ParaText id="3474984"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">However, under the new legislation, the system will have to adjudicate an individual’s file to determine if the medical release is related to service or not. This could add additional red tape to the release process and potentially delay the ability to access priority hiring upon release.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3474985">Like the ombudsman, we are worried about this uncertainty. Would it not be better to use the recognition of the link between the injury and the service to determine the accessibility and length of the priority entitlement? This could be done two ways: either the reason for release is designated “service-related medical release” or the link between the injury and the service is recognized by VAC or the VRAB. Either way, the system remains consistent, some of the red tape can be avoided and we could ensure that veterans do not lose their entitlement priority.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3474986">This bill also creates categories of veterans, and we are against that approach. The NDP supports the principle of having a single category of veterans. That is not what this bill does. </ParaText><ParaText id="3474987">Veterans of the RCMP are not included in the bill and remain in the regulatory category. I think that a member of the RCMP who suffered a trauma and wanted to get out of the policing environment to start a new career could have benefited from priority hiring under this bill. Including veterans of the RCMP would have been a way of thanking them for their service and sacrifices. Now members of the Canadian Forces released for medical reasons attributable to service will have this priority entitlement and others will not.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474988">This bill should have gone further. One major problem facing the Canadian Forces is the principle of universality of service, which requires members who cannot be deployed to be dismissed from the Canadian Forces. This is not entirely fair. We understand the importance of this principle to cohesion and morale, but would it not be possible to include the duty to accommodate principle?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3474989">Do those who served their country not deserve to be given a job where they could continue to serve? That is what the RCMP does for its members. The <Affiliation DbId="194615" Type="4">Minister of Veterans Affairs</Affiliation> says that the Department of National Defence wanted to maintain the status quo on this. However, would it not be possible for the Standing Committee on National Defence to study this issue? Does this government not owe it to our troops and our veterans?</ParaText><ParaText id="3474990">For months now we have been asking the government whether it realizes that it has a moral, social, legal and fiduciary obligation toward injured veterans. The government's lack of response would suggest not. The NDP has said time and time again that it will honour this century-long commitment made by successive Canadian governments, except for this one.</ParaText><ParaText id="3474991">Again, the NDP will support Bill <Document DbId="6284204" Type="3">C-11</Document>, but the government will have to address our concerns in committee and make the necessary changes to ensure that this bill benefits the largest possible number of veterans who need this priority entitlement for a smooth transition and a better quality of life for them and their family. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We taught them one skill: to kill or be killed, to survive in order to be able to kill tomorrow, if I can put it bluntly.

Placing injured veterans at the head of the hiring line is an empty pledge unless money for readjusting and retraining comes with it, especially in an era when the federal government is laying off government workers and there is a hiring freeze. On one hand, we are saying that we are going to give veterans the right to be at the front of the line, and on the other, we have hiring freezes. I still have a little bit of difficulty comprehending that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475042">Bill <Document DbId="6284204" Type="3">C-11</Document> should not replace the government's obligation to help Canadian Forces members stay in the forces, if that is their wish.

Veterans will have to drive from Windsor, Ontario, to London, Ontario. That is a two-hour drive. Veterans will have to drive from Sydney, Nova Scotia, to Halifax, Nova Scotia. If it is winter, and they have to go over Kellys Mountain, it is not a pleasant drive. It can take a veteran five or six hours to get across. If some of the veterans are 80 years old, are we asking them to do that drive? Is that what this country is asking a veteran to do? The veterans fought to put us in front of the line.

We are not going to ask an 80-year-old man or woman to fill in a form with somebody on the line at the 1-800 number.

And since hiring freezes are in place over most of the federal departments,“priority” consideration for frozen jobs is not of much use. The other initiative increases funding for vocational rehabilitation programs to $75,800 per veteran. But the fine print belies the seeming generosity. The money is allocated at $2 million over five years, spread over 1,300 veterans. That comes to $1,500 each, unless 40-some veterans get all of it. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>

Canada's veterans understand, given the terms and conditions of their own military careers, that there can be no guarantees about what tomorrow will bring. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475114">However, these amendments before us do offer greater certainty. They are progressive and responsible steps forward to recognize the service and sacrifice of those who serve our country so well and who wish to continue to serve Canada after their military career has ended.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475115">These amendments send a clear signal, a clear message, to Canada's men and women in uniform that our government places a high value on their skills, their training and their experience, and we do not want to lose that. These are skills we need to promote and retain, whenever appropriate and possible.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475116">Put simply, these amendments are a logical reflection of our desire to keep the highly qualified individuals who have received world-class training and who have consistently demonstrated the ability to apply their skills in situations that the majority of Canadians would never face or know.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475117">We have a potential talent pool offering demonstrated leadership and an ability to think strategically. In short, we have a group of Canadians renowned for getting the job done. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475118">Any employer in the private or public sector would be foolhardy to ignore such skills or dismiss such potential. Our government would never make such a mistake, and we encourage other levels of government to follow our lead.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475119">However, first we need to make good on these changes. We need to make sure they are quickly approved. We need to ensure that the Public Service Commission is a willing and enthusiastic partner, and we need to put measures in place to ensure the full intent and spirit of these changes is realized. We can do that. </ParaText>

It is very important.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475136">I listened closely to my colleague, the <Affiliation DbId="194615" Type="4">Minister of Veterans Affairs</Affiliation>, as he outlined the rationale behind those proposed amendments to the Public Service Employment Act and its regulations.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475137">I want to point out that the minister is an outstanding <Affiliation DbId="194615" Type="4">Minister of Veterans Affairs</Affiliation>. He cares and he works hard. He has been on many panels. I have known him since before both of us were elected to this House, and he was on the national committee and the provincial committee for the Canadian Forces Liaison Council. What that did was help reservists and others match up with jobs, as well as get employers to release reservists for very needed deployments overseas. As we know, our deployments need between 20% and 25% reservists on a regular basis to allow our missions to succeed and to be able to top up the manpower that was so critically needed in operational zones.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475138">I thank the <Affiliation DbId="194615" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> for that, and I want to congratulate him on this initiative, which marks another step in the significant progress our government has made in supporting Canada's veterans. Like many members, I am proud of what we have accomplished, particularly as it relates to helping veterans and their families make a successful transition to civilian life. That is a sacred obligation we have, a sacred obligation on which we are following through.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475139"> Yesterday this <Affiliation DbId="194615" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> tabled and outlined the 160 amendments he is making because of what veterans stakeholders and advisory groups have advised us. This government is listening very closely to what our veterans need, and we are applying that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475140">As the <Affiliation DbId="194615" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> said earlier, nothing is perfect in life. Things change, situations change, circumstances change and we have to adapt to that. That is what we are doing right now, right this minute. We are making this program the best it can possibly be today for the veterans of Canada, as they deserve and as this government has committed to do.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475141">For example, I was pleased with our government's launch of the veterans transition action plan last year, because it sets out a long-term strategy for supporting veterans in their transition to civilian life. That is a key component of this action plan, the cutting of red tape for veterans initiative. That is something the <Affiliation DbId="194615" Type="4">minister</Affiliation> also mentioned today. We are absolutely allergic to red tape. We do not like it. Nobody likes it. It is bad for veterans, and we have to cut that out, all of it, when we find it, to make it easier for them to access the services.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475142">We launched it in February 2012 with the single-minded purpose of providing veterans and their families with faster, hassle-free service, and that is what we have been doing. That is what we are going to continue to do.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475143">I would like to highlight just a few things. For example, Veterans Affairs Canada's business processes are being streamlined. The department's policies and programs are being simplified. New technology and e-services are being used to meet the needs expressed by Canada's veterans. The results so far have been impressive.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475144">Turnaround times for processing veterans' disability benefits have been improved, and access to rehabilitation services is now being approved in just two weeks instead of four. That is just the start of the accomplishments.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475145">By the time this five-year initiative is fully implemented, Veterans Affairs Canada's programs, benefits and services will be the most responsive, inclusive and flexible ever seen by Canada's veterans. We will be delivering them as quickly and efficiently as possible.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475146">Veterans are already reaping many of the benefits. In October, for example, the <Affiliation DbId="194615" Type="4">Minister of Veterans Affairs</Affiliation> announced a new approach to our vocational rehabilitation program, and that provides eligible veterans with up to $75,800 in training to start a new career. That is a great amount of money and that is helpful in helping them start in the new careers, new trades, new skills to which they need to take the existing skills they have, which are world-class skills they have learned in the military, and translate those to a civilian career.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475147">That is great news for approximately 1,300 veterans presently participating in vocational rehabilitation and vocational assessment services. These changes also build on other recent enhancements.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475148">For example, the process for reimbursing veterans for travel costs to and from their medical appointments has been simplified. That means that about 18,000 veterans no longer need to send receipts or verify their appointments with the department to cover their travel expenses. That is a big administrative burden lifted off their shoulders. This one change has eliminated a lot of cumbersome paperwork for eligible veterans and is putting money back into their pockets faster. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="05">(1705)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3475149">The same is being done for more than 100,000 veterans, widows, and caregivers enrolled in a veterans' independence program. In January, veterans began receiving upfront payments for grounds maintenance and housekeeping services. They no longer have to pay out of their pocket for these services and then wait to be reimbursed. This is yet another administrative burden lifted off their shoulders. The full suite of e-services also ensures that veterans and their families can access the relevant information that they are looking for at any time of day or night. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475150">These kinds of changes make a real difference. That is what the proposed legislative amendments will also do. With these changes to the Public Service Employment Act and its regulations, we will create a five year statutory priority entitlement for Canadian veterans who are medically released for service related reasons. This will move qualified veterans to the front of the line for new positions in the federal public service so these remarkable men and women, these patriots, can continue to serve our great country if they so chose.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475151">Additionally, through the regulatory changes that would follow, full-time regular and reserve force veterans who are medically released for non-service related reasons will see their existing level of priority extended from two years to five years. It will also allow them a longer period of priority access to positions that they are qualified to fill. That is an incredible improvement.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475152">These changes are also about providing veterans with real and meaningful new employment and career opportunities and doing so in recognition of their service and the sacrifices they have made in the name of Canada. Once these changes take effect, Canadian veterans medically released for service related reasons will be able to pursue new careers in the federal public service on a higher priority and a longer term basis than ever before. This is something that we are very proud to be doing for our veterans.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475153">I know Canadians support this kind of honourable recognition and support for Canada's veterans. It reflects our nation's gratitude for everything our men and women in uniform, past and present, have done to protect and defend our democracy and our way of life. It also reflects our collective desire to continue to have highly-qualified Canadians putting their hard-earned skills and training to work for our country and ensuring that our economy continues to grow on the strength of a well placed workforce and employees who are realizing their full potential. When employers hire a veteran, they are hiring somebody with a tremendous tool kit of skills right now.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475154">These proposed amendments to the Public Service Employment Act should also be viewed as another way to strengthen overall skill sets and therefore the overall effectiveness of the federal public service. It is not only a fair thing to do; it is the right thing to do. Quite frankly, it is the Canadian thing to do. I would hope that all levels of government across the country will do the same and adopt similar policies.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475155">Canada's veterans only want a fair opportunity to find meaningful and rewarding employment when their military service to Canada ends. However, they sometimes do not fully realize how marketable their skills are, or how to explain their experience and training to civilian employers. This is something we help with through programs like Helmets to Hardhats and other initiatives that help veterans to translate those numerous skills they have. In this job, my veteran colleagues and I, who speak about this often, always relate back to the great skills that we learned in the Canadian Forces and how applicable they are to everything we do in life. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475156">The amendments before us are one way to tear down those barriers. They are an expression of the value we place on our men and women in uniform. It is the right thing to do.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475157">I want to address something that a member mentioned earlier about how the two particular priorities for Canadian soldiers are to kill or be killed. Quite frankly, it is nonsense. Members of the Canadian Armed Forces have a whole myriad of skills in their toolkits. For example, the most obvious right now relates to the DAR teams deployed to the Philippines. They are providing badly needed assistance to people in dire need. The people in these teams are engineers, people producing water and sanitary conditions. They are bringing food, helicopters, and other logistics to do that. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475158">Canadian Armed Forces members aid civil authorities, such as at the Olympics in 2010. They perform diplomatic roles, for example, as attachés in our embassies around the world. They work as trainers for other armies, as our soldiers are doing in Kabul right now or in the Canadian Forces College.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3475159">In fact, some of the soldiers have continuing education. There are many members of the Canadian Armed Forces presently with master's degrees and Ph.D.s. They are a very accomplished lot.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475160">The point of all of this is to help our veterans make that seamless transition to civilian life where they can best utilize the incredible skills they have learned through a lifetime of service to Canada.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I think it is an important topic. To me, any day that we can talk about veterans, RCMP members and their families, and the men and women who serve our country on a regular basis is always a good day for the House of Commons, because these are the types of subjects we should be discussing on a more constant basis.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475178">Before I start, I want to give personal kudos to my colleague from Dartmouth—Cole Harbour, my personal friend and seatmate next to me in terms of the riding in Nova Scotia, for his father, who was known as W.L. “Red” Chisholm. He was in the Canadian Air Force. He received the DFC and bar. Unfortunately, he passed away in 2005. I want to offer the greatest round of applause and gratitude to my colleague, his late father, and all those who served our country for their tremendous service.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475179"> I understand exactly why the government brought this particular legislation forward. I am one of the few people here who had discussions with the late Jack Stagg, the former deputy minister and the former minister of veterans affairs, when it came to the actual implementation of the new veterans charter. Even though there are a fair number of concerns and issues with it, I am proud to say that I worked with our party to help the other parties get that legislation through, because in the end, when we compare apples to apples, it is a better program than it was before. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475180">That said, there are many deficiencies within it.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475181"> Because it is a living document, everyone, including the veterans associations, was assured that when problems are recognized, the document could be opened up immediately and the problems dealt with right away. The unfortunate part is that the first crack in the charter was on Bill C-55, an important piece of legislation that received unanimous support from the House of Commons, in order to improve the lives of a lot of veterans out there financially.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475182">We have heard other concerns with the new veterans charter. The reality is our committee will be looking at that hopefully in the most non-partisan way we can to, as the minister said yesterday, and in a proactive, non-partisan manner give recommendations to the minister so that the minister can then go to cabinet. We know that budget time is coming up and that all the departments will be looking at the same Canadian tax dollars and the best way to allocate them. I thank the minister and the parliamentary secretary for listening to the debate today. We would like to give him some basic recommendations that he can then take to cabinet to improve the lives of all veterans, RCMP members, and their families.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475183">Getting back to the particular aspect of priority hiring for military personnel who leave the military either on a volunteer basis or through what we call a 3(b) release for either physical or psychological injuries, we applaud this idea, but in the veterans charter, priority hiring was one the major aspects. It shows us that the system did not really work well when legislation has to come forward seven years later to deal with this issue once again.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475184">We found out over the years that the Department of National Defence was the biggest employer of veterans. The Department of Veterans Affairs was next. All of the other departments did very little in hiring veterans in that regard. Hopefully, with this legislation, we can encourage on a proactive basis, through the Public Service Commission and everyone else, the opportunity and ability for the heroes of our country to remain gainfully employed, because the entire aspect of the veterans charter, and this was the key selling point, was care, not cash. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475185">I say this very clearly. The ability for them to understand that although they are 24 years old and injured they still have worth, not just to themselves and their families but also to their country, and the ability of the government of the day to provide programs and systems to ensure that they and their families get the benefits they richly deserve in order to lift themselves up, be gainfully employed, and have economic opportunities right through the natural part of their lives was the key to this.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475186">I am pleased to see that the government has now offered an opportunity through legislation to ensure that we get this right. However, there are some questions we have to ask when the bill gets to committee. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3475187">I would like to tell the minister and the parliamentary secretary that the federal New Democrats will be supporting this legislation. We hope to be able to make some friendly amendments when it gets to committee on several things, such as who will be monitoring, through the Public Service Commission and departments of the federal government, to ensure this works for veterans and RCMP members.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475188"> We want to include RCMP members as well. It may be an oversight by the government, but because RCMP veterans also have to go to DVA to get their benefits, we feel they should also be included in this important legislation so that they too can have the opportunities that our military veterans may have in future employment with federal departments right across the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475189">As has been said before by my hon. colleagues on both sides of the House, the men and women who serve in our military and RCMP have tremendous skills. Whether it is Helmets to Hardhats or working for the Coast Guard or CSIS or whatever it is that they do, these men and women can provide great service to all of Canada in this regard.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475190">I am pleased to say that we will be supporting the bill, but we would like to see the RCMP included.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475191">My second point is also very important. I met with many groups. I met with Helmets to Hardhats and with people in other departments, and I can say that an awful lot of veterans leave the military with some sort of psychological concern. Certain triggers can affect different veterans in different ways. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475192">Maybe the department can take notes and get back to us on this point: will the department offer intense training to companies and departments throughout Canada on veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder or operational stress injury so that they will be able to understand sensitivities that a veteran may be going through and watch for triggers? A company may have a well-qualified veteran working for it, but in a new environment the veteran may experience something that triggers that reaction. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475193">Several years ago at the DND dockyards, there was a veteran who got a job with the DND firefighters. The problem was, and this is no disrespect to them, that they were not properly advised or trained on the individual, their new buddy. This person had some pretty serious psychological concerns, but the people he was newly working with did not fully understand or appreciate what he was going through, so he just could not work there any more. He could not handle the stress of that new environment. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475194">This outcome can be avoided if we are proactive in this regard. When an individual who has PTSD, OSI, or a physical injury passes the qualifications and gets hired in a new department, the people in that department should already fully understand that veteran's situation. This is not only a hero of our country, but a person who has some concerns that he or she has to deal with on a regular or maybe a lifetime basis. We simply do not know. I think sensitivity shown to these individuals would be very helpful in integrating them into a new work environment.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475195"> I admit that I did not wear the uniform of Canada, but many of my friends and many colleagues in this House did. For those who have served for a long time, the military becomes a way of life. The RCMP becomes a way of life. For those who have been firefighters or police officers for many years, such as the <Affiliation DbId="194615" Type="4">Minister of Veterans Affairs</Affiliation>, it becomes a way of life. However, the day comes when that uniform comes off. That is a pretty serious moment.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475196"> I remember many times people telling me that the proudest day they ever had was when they put on the red serge for the first time at Depot in Regina, and the saddest day was when they took it off. These are people who had a wonderful career, but when you talk to them after they leave, they are in a blue funk for a while. There is a feeling of “Now what do I do?” </ParaText><ParaText id="3475197">Also very important is that we will be asking the government to give an individual prior to being released from the military and getting training for an occupation in a different field all the opportunities, the financial and human benefits, in order to walk them through that process, because many of these veterans believe, in some cases, that all they can do is work for the military. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3475198">That may not happen, but we have to be able to encourage them in a positive way by ensuring that there are benefits to help them get through, educational or occupational benefits or whatever it is, to be able to carry on and move through the next door, as they say, in order to obtain gainful employment and be a productive member of society. That is exactly what we would hope to do through the legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475199">I want to assure the <Affiliation DbId="194615" Type="4">Minister of Veterans Affairs</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="194843" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> that we on this side of the House will be supporting the legislation. We hope to be proactive and maybe work on amendments. We will bring witnesses and maybe other departments before the committee to explain exactly how they anticipate accepting the arrival of military and RCMP veterans and ask what they would do in order to enhance the comfort level of welcoming them into the new family they have, to make them feel very proud of what they have done. It needs to be understood that when veterans have injuries, either physical or psychological, it is a serious problem to deal with. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475200">I look at Senator Roméo Dallaire and what he has done to work through the condition he has suffered over the years. He is a beautiful, classic example of someone who has a very serious psychological concern about what he experienced in Rwanda and elsewhere, and how, with the help of his family, the Liberal Party and others, he was able to manage his concerns and become a very highly respected citizen, not only of this country but of the entire world. He is a shining example of what can happen when one falls on one's knees, gets picked up and is able to move forward, and, as they say in the great province of Newfoundland and Labrador, to bash on. That is what we will be hoping to ensure with the legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475201">Again, I thank the <Affiliation DbId="194843" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="194615" Type="4">Minister of Veterans Affairs</Affiliation> and my colleague, the Liberal critic, for being here. In fact, I have to say that every single time we have debated a bill on veterans, the minister, regardless of what party, has always sat through the entire debate. On a personal level, I thoroughly enjoy that because it shows that the individual in question cares. Of course, I could go on and talk about all the failures of the Department of Veterans Affairs, but that would take another couple of hours. After winning that award yesterday, I do not think it would diminish my standing in the House of Commons.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475202">At this time, I want to say that at the very end of the day the men and women who serve our country are our true national heroes. They and their families deserve everything we can do to assist them to become gainfully employed in employment that is meaningful and challenges them, so that they wake up in the morning and go to bed at night knowing they have done something that they and their families can be proud of. For that, I am very proud to say that the leader of the federal New Democrats and myself will be supporting the legislation.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

					<Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Adler" id="8143595"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170479" Type="2">Mr. Mark Adler</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3475241">Mr. Speaker, I stand in the House to represent the wishes of my constituents. When I go through the streets of York Centre and knock on doors and listen carefully to their ideas and concerns, what I am hearing on the doorstep is that Canadians want a strong economy, low taxes, safe streets and transparent government. That is what my constituents expect from me and from this Conservative government. That is why I have tabled this bill before us at this time.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475242">I submit that the proposed legislation will supplement and add transparency to the regime governing political activities of public servants. I believe all members of the House will agree that, while non-partisanship is expected of all public servants, agents of Parliament play a particularly vital role in government oversight.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475243">Agents of Parliament such as the Auditor General, the Commissioner of Official Languages and the Information Commissioner are a unique group of independent statutory officers who serve to scrutinize the activity of government. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475244">They report directly to Parliament rather than to government or to an individual minister and so exist to serve Parliament in relation to Parliament's oversight role. This is extremely critical to the balance and fairness of our institutions.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475245"> Agents normally produce a report to Parliament to account for their own activities, and their institutional heads are typically appointed through special resolutions of the House of Commons and the Senate.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475246">I submit that, given the close relationship of agents of Parliament and their employees with parliamentarians, it is critical that in carrying out their duties they be independent of any political affiliation. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475247">Moreover, given their high level of political visibility, I believe it is crucial that agents and their staff work in a non-partisan way to maintain the confidence of parliamentarians and Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475248">The elected officials and members of the House all know the difference between saying something innocuous and accidentally winding up on the front page of <I>The Globe and Mail</I>. Here in the House, perhaps more than anywhere else in Canada, words matter. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475249">Words matter in reports as well. That is why neutrality in the office of an agent of Parliament is so critical to ensuring Canadians receive information as clear and as true as they expect.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475250">At every step of the process in preparing a report or dealing with a case, from the selection of what to study, to the research, to the basic wording, neutrality and independence must be maintained. I believe, and I am sure we all would agree here, that this subconsciously would be challenging for former partisans.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475251">Would the opposition trust a report issued out of an office staffed by former professional Conservative partisans? I do not believe so and it is understandable that they might not. The same goes for us on this side of the House. We would be suspicious of a report prepared by NDP partisans.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475252">That is why the bill benefits all parliamentarians and all Canadians. It shines a light on potential conflicts of interest in the preparation of reports. It ensures that neutrality and even-handedness are being respected. It respects the process and ensures that these offices are being operated and populated as intended.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475253">Politics is a tough business. It is like a tug-of-war that never ends. It is important that the referees be above the fray. I believe this is the case currently and would merely like to enshrine this expectation through disclosure.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475254">With that goal in mind, the bill would require every person who applies for a position in the office of an agent of Parliament to make a declaration with respect to past engagement in politically partisan positions.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475255">In particular, this declaration would state whether, in the 10-year period before applying for that position, the person occupied certain specified politically partisan positions.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475256">The bill also prescribes a declaration in the case of persons who work in the office of an agent of Parliament and the agents themselves. Such a declaration would state whether these persons intend to occupy a politically partisan position while continuing to occupy the position of agent of Parliament or work in the office of such an agent.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475257">To promote even more transparency, the declarations would be posted on the website of the office of the relevant agent of Parliament.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="30">(1830)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3475258">In addition, the bill would require an agent of Parliament and the persons who work in his or her office to provide a written undertaking that they will conduct themselves in a non-partisan manner in fulfilling the official duties and responsibilities of their positions. The bill also provides for the examination of alleged partisan conduct. These provisions would provide enhanced transparency and accountability for parliamentarians, who must have confidence that the work of agents of Parliament is impartial. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475259">As the House knows, accountability and transparency in Canada's public and democratic institutions are the hallmarks of our Conservative government. That was part of our government's promise to Canadians when we were first elected in 2006, and it is why one of the first things we did on coming into power was bring in the Federal Accountability Act and its accompanying action plan. We committed, and we delivered. The act, along with its companion action plan, holds everyone accountable, from the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to parliamentarians, from public sector employees to recipients of government funding.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475260">Let me give the House a few examples. We designated deputy ministers accounting officers who must appear before the parliamentary committees to be accountable for the management of their departments. We did this for the simple reason that organizations paid for with public money should be open to public scrutiny. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475261">We also introduced measures to strengthen ethical conduct in the public service. Through the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act, we empowered public service employees and Canadians to honestly and openly report government wrongdoing without fear of reprisal. We brought in reforms to the Lobbying Act and its regulations to respond to Canadians' desire for more transparency and ethical behaviour in lobbying activities. We also brought into force the Conflict of Interest Act and named a conflict of interest and ethics commissioner so that Canadians would have the opportunity to voice their concerns about unethical behaviour in government and hold violators accountable. To help give these accountability measures teeth, we introduced new criminal penalties and sanctions for anyone who commits fraud against the Crown. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475262">Canadians also told us loud and clear that they wanted a government that is more open and transparent. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475263">As former U.S. Supreme Justice Louis Brandeis once said, sunlight is the best disinfectant. Indeed, the Federal Accountability Act delivered, shining a light on the operations of the government. It has given Canadians broader and better access to more information from public organizations than ever before. It has extended the Access to Information Act to cover the Canadian Wheat Board, five foundations, five agents of Parliament and most crown corporations and their wholly owned subsidiaries.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475264">The reforms contained in this act are in a direct line of descent from the political reforms that first brought responsible government to this country. We can show that our changes in governance are working. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475265">Let us take a look at access to information, an area where the government is setting records here in Canada. In 2012, the Conservative government released a record number of materials through access to information requests. Six million pages were released to the public last year. That is not all. The number of requests processed increased by 27%. That is 10,000 more requests over the previous year, which set a new record.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475266">One could be forgiven for thinking that these record numbers would have bogged the government down or slowed down turnaround times. I am happy to say that they did not. In fact, this year, the government had one of its fastest turnaround rates on record. More requests were filled and more materials were released, and it was all done more quickly and efficiently.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475267">When Canadians say that they want openness and accountability, they expect results. These numbers do not lie. Thanks to this Conservative government, Canadians are getting more, better, and faster access than ever before. That is just one concrete example of how the government is delivering on its promises to Canadians and just one example of how the accountability act has opened up the doors of government to the public.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475268">The bill I bring before the House today continues our efforts to make our system of government even better. Our government fully supports the bill's intent to augment and supplement the existing regime in ensuring that agents of Parliament and their employees do not engage in political activities that conflict or are seen to conflict with their official duties and conduct. I look forward to its examination in committee to further discuss its effectiveness and its relationship to the tools already in place to protect the impartiality of the public service.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3475269">I encourage all members of the House to support this bill. I hope my colleagues across the aisle see this as a way of protecting all of our rights as parliamentarians and as a means of ensuring that Canadians get the most fair and unbiased information possible, as they expect. I believe that we can all agree that this is an important step in ensuring transparency and accountability in the House.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The short title I would have given it is “An Act avoiding the real issue”.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475282">The system of democracy is based on a number of mechanisms that guarantee its legitimacy: the right to vote, the right to be elected, the right to be represented, the division of powers, accountability—of course—transparency, and so on. I will take a few minutes to explore some of these elements in more depth.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475283">It goes without saying that, in a modern democracy, representatives, elected officials, parliamentarians as a whole, derive their legitimacy from an election. Election by universal suffrage is one of the basic principles of democracy. The Conservative government today is the government of Canada because our electoral system gave it a majority of votes, even though that majority was by no means the same as the majority of the votes cast by Canadians. Do I need to remind the House that this majority government was elected with 39% of the popular vote? Voter turnout was right around 60%. We are a long way from a full voter turnout. However, that is the way our political system works. The right to govern is based on an election.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475284">Without any doubt, people are also aware that our parliamentary system has a long historical tradition and that some significant anachronisms remain. The most significant of them will probably be solved in 2015, when the New Democrats come to power. Canada is one of the last democratic countries in the world to have a chamber of its Parliament made up of unelected people. I refer, of course, to the Senate. As I was looking through the parliamentary website, I came upon a definition that I really want to quote: </ParaText><ParaText id="3475285"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">In a democratic country, all eligible citizens have the right to participate, either directly or indirectly, in making the decisions that affect them. Canadian citizens normally elect someone to represent them in making decisions at the different levels of government. This is called a representative democracy. Countries like Canada, the United States of America and the United Kingdom all have representative democracies.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3475286">Let us look at this definition of democracy as it relates to the Senate. In Canada, some representatives make decisions without being elected by the people. It looks like we must either tailor the definition of democracy to the reality of Canada or remove it from our own website. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475287">The other pillar of democracy is the power to hold any institution accountable. The Senate scandal would have remained hidden from Canadians if not for the mechanisms of accountability, oversight and transparency. Despite this, we are unfortunately still far from knowing the sad truth about this affair.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475288">In this context, Bill <Document DbId="6251908" Type="4">C-520, An Act supporting non-partisan agents of Parliament</Document> is apparently intended to mitigate partisanship in Parliament and enhance government transparency. That is a good plan. It is true that on this second point, something has to be done. After all, this is the same government that repeatedly relies on gag orders—there were over 50 of them during the last session—often stays silent during debates in the House, conducts far too many committee meetings in camera and uses omnibus bills to bury even deeper everything that Canadians are entitled to know. The Conservatives are trying to tell us about transparency. I am certainly willing to talk about it, but as we often say back home, it would be nice if they could walk the talk.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475289">In our Parliament there are people we sometimes call “officers of Parliament”. We know them well and greatly appreciate the work they do. I am referring to such people as the Auditor General, the Chief Electoral Officer, the Commissioner of Official Languages and the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner. These people take on responsibilities to serve Parliament, and they report to Parliament. It is obviously necessary to preserve their independence from the government in power, so they can assume the responsibilities conferred on them under the law.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475290">The bill introduced by the Conservatives is somewhat underhanded in that it suggests that these agents of Parliament are not really impartial and calls for increased transparency in how they do their work.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="45">(1845)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3475291">Bill <Document DbId="6251908" Type="4">C-520</Document> claims that its purpose is to avoid conflicts that are likely to arise or be perceived to arise between partisan activities and the official duties and responsibilities of agents of Parliament or their staff. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475292">The bill also requires agents of Parliament and anyone who applies for a position in the office of an agent of Parliament to declare any politically partisan positions they held in the previous 10 years—as though people are not allowed to have a life before Parliament—and any politically partisan positions they currently hold or intend to hold in the future. The government seems less strict or less demanding when it comes to former Conservative MPs who resign, decide to change careers and then return as consultants for their friends. No matter.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475293">What exactly constitutes a politically partisan position? For the Conservatives, it means being an electoral candidate, an electoral district association officer, a member of a ministerial staff, a member of the House of Commons, a member of a parliamentary staff, or a member of a political staff. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475294">Once again, the bill's main goal seems commendable, but in reality the bill is very dangerous to our democracy. First, we are concerned that such a bill would discourage many candidates who have expressed their opinions publicly or actively participated in our democracy over the course of their lives. Ten years is a long time.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475295">This bill could also be seen as an attempt to intimidate agents of Parliament. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475296">The bill goes off the rails when it indicates that any senator or MP can ask that an agent of Parliament investigate the partisan activities of his or her staff. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475297">I must say that, personally, I am not a big fan of this way of doing things, which could be compared to a witch hunt. We have seen other examples of this. There has been an increasing number of witch hunts. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475298">Need I remind hon. members of the case of Ms. Therrien, who lost her job as a result of a witch hunt when she put the public good or the good of all Canadians ahead of political partisanship? She is still paying a high price for her actions today. Since she was dismissed, she is not eligible for employment insurance. As a result, she has only the solidarity and generosity of Canadians to help her through this difficult time when she is looking for a new job and needs support. That is just one example.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475299">We live in a country where everyone can express their political opinions without fear that their careers will be affected, especially in the public service or in our Parliament, as long as their political opinions do not affect or influence the work those agents or public servants are supposed to do. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475300">Part 7 of the Public Service Employment Act already allows public servants to engage in political activities as long as those activities do not affect or appear to affect their ability to fulfill their duties in a politically impartial fashion. That is already covered. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475301">The Values and Ethics Code for the Public Service also broadly states that public servants must carry out their duties in a non-partisan and impartial manner. With the exception of unfounded politically motivated witch hunts, there have never been any proven incidents of partisan activities or apparent conflicts in those offices. As I was saying, the activities of those offices are already regulated by the Public Service Employment Act, the Political Activities Regulations and the Values and Ethics Code for the Public Service.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475302">Mr. Speaker, you are telling me that I have one minute left. If I did not believe you were fully impartial, I would say that time is running out faster for me than for others, but I believe you.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475303">In short, there are three measures that already guarantee the impartiality of the agents of Parliament whose work we greatly appreciate. At the same time, no incident has been reported. As a result, we cannot help but ask: what is the point of this bill?</ParaText><ParaText id="3475304">In conclusion, let me say that the Conservatives' idea of accountability consists of making Canadians forget the government's repeated lack of parliamentary accountability by irrationally attacking and intimidating the parliamentary watchdogs whose job is to hold the government accountable.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475305">I could also tell you about Mr. Page, but I know I do not have time.</ParaText>

However, this legislation is a solution looking for a problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475308">There is no problem with our officers of Parliament being non-partisan. They all do their jobs very well. This legislation, which tries to make our officers of Parliament non-partisan, is sort of like a red herring.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475309">Let us take a look at the individuals in question.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475310">We are talking about only eight individuals who are officers of Parliament who are normally chosen by the government in consultation with all the parties. Usually these officers of Parliament have a fairly good vetting process through the political environment. These individuals are the Auditor General, the Chief Electoral Officer, the Commissioner of Official Languages, the Privacy Commissioner, the Information Commissioner, the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner, the Commissioner of Lobbying and the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475311">These individuals do not need to sign a waiver to say that they have not been partisan and that they will not be partisan. This is something that one goes through during the job interview. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475312">Do members not feel we need to find the people who are best suited for these jobs regardless of their political affiliation? Just because they might be a Conservative, or a New Democrat or Liberal does it automatically make them bad people and they cannot do the job?</ParaText><ParaText id="3475313">Let us look at the government's choice in the Auditor General. One of the most fundamental things in our hiring system is that we hire someone who is bilingual. That sort of got left out when the government hired our current Auditor General. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475314">We really need to look at the individuals who are seeking these jobs and not base it on some party political affiliation that would deem them inappropriate. We want the best people in these jobs and this bill would certainly limit that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475315">Talking about partisanship and political appointments, if the government were serious in cracking down on partisan and political appointments, why does it not look at some of the 1,157 people it has appointed in six short years from partisan activities to the Canada Pension Review Tribunal, to the Toronto Port Authority, to the Canada School of Energy and Environment, to the Immigration and Refugee Board and to the Employment Insurance Boards of Referees? It goes on and on.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475316"> I could sit here and list hundreds upon hundreds of donors, Conservative bagmen sitting on riding associations, supporters, former Conservative cabinet ministers and former staff to different premiers. I could go on and on. Therefore, if the Conservatives are truly serious about cutting out partisanship, why do they not look at themselves and some of the appointments they have made as a government and not look at our agents of Parliament?</ParaText><ParaText id="3475317">The bill is a little misguided. It is a bit of a red herring in this debate and it is trying to cast aspersions on some fine agents of our Parliament. It really misses the mark where the patronage trough begins and it begins with the government and some of the over 1,100 appointments that it has made to different appeals, tribunals and boards in government. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475318">If the Conservatives really want to look at cutting out partisanship, they should look at themselves first rather than try to bring in some phoney legislation that would come to our officers of Parliament, who are all people who go through an enormous vetting process. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475319">I am sure in the vetting process for our Chief Electoral Officer, we would look at what he has done in the last 10 years. For many people who apply for these positions, we would look at their resume in the last 10 years. Therefore, the legislation really does nothing. It only tries to claim some transparency and that Conservatives are all of a sudden concerned about partisanship when deep down they have done that over 1,100 times in the short six years they have been in government.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475320">When we come to private member's bills, we should look at something that could really make a difference rather than some bill that would prop up the government to say how great it is doing things. This legislation is totally misguided.</ParaText>

That kind of talk is why I am here tonight. I am very pleased to have this opportunity to provide the government's response to Bill <Document DbId="6251908" Type="4">C-520, An Act supporting non-partisan agents of Parliament</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475322">Our government is committed to the principle of political impartiality of the public service, agents of Parliament and officers of Parliament. This principle is a fundamental element of our system of government and ensures that Canadians and parliamentarians benefit from the non-partisan delivery of services.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475323">The bill before us would supplement and add transparency to the existing regime governing political activities, which is why our government is pleased to support it.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475324">I do not believe it is a secret to anyone in this place that partisanship is alive and well in this chamber, no different than any provincial legislature or local governments and elsewhere. The interesting thing about partisanship is how often it is one side that accuses the other, while overlooking that it takes two or more to tango.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475325">I would submit that partisanship, overall, is on the rise. We now have groups and organizations that exist, in some cases, solely for partisan purposes. I will not name names, as we also know that some of the most partisan groups claim to be non-partisan, and that is what brings me back to the importance of the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475326"> For this place to function for government, for opposition, for elected officials and, most important, for Canadians, we need to maintain and enhance a professional non-partisan public service.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475327">I have a great respect for all members of the House who I am certain join our government in recognizing that non-partisanship is what makes responsible, democratic government work. An impartial public administration ensures that Canadians, regardless of their views, receive fair and objective treatment from government officials. The work that our public service performs on behalf of Canadians is important, from border guards to food inspectors and from public health specialists to safety investigators.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475328">One of the many benefits of non-partisanship is that public servants are selected based upon qualification, merit and expertise, as opposed to political affiliation. That is why the Values and Ethics Code and the provisions of the Public Service Employment Act protect the impartiality of the public service and, specifically, agents of Parliament. Clearly, the principle of non-partisanship is not to be taken lightly.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475329">In fact, it is essential to the success of the public service that this reputation and tradition of impartiality should be maintained in the eyes of both the public and parliamentarians, which is why the bill has come forward at an opportune time.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475330">In budget 2013, our government committed to review and update public service processes and systems to ensure the public service would continue to serve Canadians well. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475331">This bill is consistent with that commitment. It recognizes that while non-partisanship is expected of all public servants, agents of Parliament play a particularly important role in government oversight. Agents of Parliament carry out duties assigned by statute and report to one or both of the Senate and the House of Commons. The individuals appointed to these offices perform work on behalf of Parliament and report to those chambers, usually, through the Speakers.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475332">Given the close relationship of agents of Parliaments and their employees with parliamentarians, their independence from political affiliation in carrying out their duties is essential.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475333">Furthermore, given that much of this work is political and, by extension, partisan in nature, it is vital that agents and their staff work in non-partisan ways to maintain the confidence of parliamentarians and Canadians. To that end, the bill would require that every person who applied for a position in the office of an agent of Parliament to make a declaration with respect to past engagement in politically partisan positions.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="00">(1900)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3475334">Specifically, this declaration would state whether, in the 10 years before applying for that position, the person occupied certain specified politically partisan positions. Now in the case of persons who work in the office of an agent of Parliament and the agents themselves, a declaration would state whether or not they intend to occupy a politically partisan position while continuing to occupy the position of agent of Parliament or work in the office of such an agent.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475335">The declarations would then be posted on the website of the office of the relevant agent of Parliament. As well, the bill would require the agent of Parliament and the persons who work in his or her office to provide a written undertaking that they will conduct themselves in a non-partisan manner in fulfilling the official duties and responsibilities of that position.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475336">The bill also provides the examination of alleged partisan conduct. These provisions provide enhanced transparency and accountability for parliamentarians who must have the confidence that the work of the agents of Parliament are impartial. I believe, as members, we have an obligation to support the principle that agents of Parliament and their employees should not engage in political activities that conflict or may be seen to conflict with their official duties.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475337">Our government supports the intent of the bill and looks forward to its examination at committee to ensure that nothing in this bill will diminish the effectiveness of the tools that are already in place to protect the impartiality of the public service.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475338">Before I close, I would like to add one more comment on why I personally support this particular bill. We know that 83% of Canadians now actively use the Internet. In fact, in my home province of British Columbia that number is now 87%. We also know that the Internet has been available to Canadians for around 20 years.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475339">I mention this because never before in our history has so much personal information been available to the general public online. I know I am not alone in pointing out that all governments struggle to keep pace with this technology. Bill <Document DbId="6251908" Type="4">C-520</Document> creates an opportunity for public servants to make full and open disclosure on any previous political events they may or may not have been involved with. Given that many of these events can be found online and by extension potentially misunderstood online, I see Bill C-520 as creating an opportunity for increased transparency and proactive disclosure.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475340">This can then help resolve potential conflicts and misunderstandings and will help ensure Canada has a non-partisan civil service that we all can be confident in. I encourage all members of the House to support this important legislation, which augments the principle of non-partisanship in our system of government. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I am pleased to at least be able to speak to the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475342">This witch hunt is unfounded, and the Conservatives are using it for purely political purposes. First of all, there have never been any reports of incidents or actual or apparent conflict in these offices. I would like to add that political activities of public servants are already strictly regulated under part 7 of the Public Service Employment Act, the Political Activities Regulations and the Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector. The only two offices not covered by those measures are the Senate Ethics Officer and the Ethics Commissioner. That is because they have their own very strict internal code, because they work in the area of ethics.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475343">The first thing that jumps out at me from this bill is that it applies to agents of Parliament. It also applies to anyone who might want to work in their office ones day. For example, it applies to the Auditor General as well as the person in charge of answering the telephone and saying that you have reached the Office of the Auditor General of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475344">This is in no way related to how important the desired position is. It is black and white; it applies to everyone. Some people are already subject to strict codes, like translators, who are required to keep their work confidential. It makes absolutely no sense. The Conservatives are looking for problems where there are none. What is even more hypocritical is that they are saying that the problem involves everyone working in the offices of agents of Parliament, when we know that this has never been an issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475345">The government is doing this, yet it appointed I do not know how many defeated candidates to nearly all the positions it was able to fill. Every time a position opened up, the government found a partisan candidate who had donated to the Conservative Party or a defeated candidate to fill it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475346">I find that particularly hypocritical. The Conservatives need to acknowledge that they sometimes went too far in making partisan appointments and that they may not have made the best appointments. For example, Mr. Duffy, Ms. Wallin and Mr. Brazeau were appointed to the Senate. Well done. Talk about putting the right person in the right place.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475347">I think we can all see that the government's judgment is completely disastrous. Perhaps it could admit that it has a problem and it should work toward having less partisan candidates in positions of some importance. I think the position of senator is a fairly important one in Canada. Instead of thinking about itself, looking inward and saying that it could maybe do something intelligent, the government is saying that the problem is the receptionist who works in the agent of Parliament's office, or perhaps even the person who cleans the office. It makes no sense, frankly. No distinction is made and everyone is lumped together.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475348">Moreover, the government does not distinguish between politics, politicians and policy-makers. It seems to me that these concepts are crucial, because they imply different levels of involvement. Generally speaking, we also know that Canadians' apathy toward politics is at an all-time high. Close to 40% of Canadians do not vote. I think citizen involvement should be more highly regarded.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475349">I think it is normal that people who have already been involved in political activities should be interested in the political system and should want to work in that area because they have had a similar job. However, the Conservatives make no distinction with respect to regions, either. In my region, some municipalities have only about 150 voters. On average, one person in 25 in the town could be a councillor or the mayor. Now, all that has to be declared. It is crazy. It is important to note that all that needs to be disclosed.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="10">(1910)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3475350">Everything has to be posted on the website. Therefore the names of all employees in these positions, with their statements, have to be posted regardless of what they do. This makes absolutely no sense. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475351">There is something else that makes no sense and has to be discussed. Indeed, any member of Parliament or senator can ask an agent of Parliament to inquire into the partisan activities of his or her staff members.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475352">For example, if a person is unhappy with someone else for any reason, that person can ask for an investigation of that someone else. Agents of Parliament will therefore be conducting investigations. I hope there will not be too many of them, but with the Conservatives, you never know.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475353">Agents of Parliament have a specific job to do. We all agree that the Commissioner of Official Languages, for example, is overworked because of all the cuts and mismanagement of the Conservative government. Therefore what will he be doing? He will not be doing his job, as he will be busy investigating certain employees who may or may not be engaging in partisan activities.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475354"> Neither members nor Conservatives are even required to make a valid complaint. They can file a complaint without having any idea of whether it is valid or not. There will be no consequences. Whenever people have any doubts about employees, they will simply make a complaint and an agent of Parliament will investigate these employees instead of doing his or her job.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475355">Worse, any member of Parliament or senator may request an investigation, but agents of Parliament will not be able to investigate the activities of the Senate. The Senate may ask for an investigation of agents of Parliament, but agents of Parliament will not be able to investigate senators. They will have to obtain a special warrant. Not even the Auditor General can decide on his own to investigate certain senators.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475356">Of course, we do not know of any senators with strange spending habits, do we? No, we have never heard of such a thing. None of this makes any sense, especially given the huge scandal in the Senate right now.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475357">It is clear that senators could ask for investigations into agents of Parliament, but agents of Parliament could not investigate senators. However, it is quite obvious that the Senate warrants far more investigation than the agents of Parliament.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475358">This really is a bill that is totally useless. It is a witch hunt that shows a total lack of respect for the public service.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475359">I think the bill tells Canadians to avoid getting involved in any way, because if they do, they will never be able to get a job with the government, which will shut them out. It makes absolutely no sense.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475360">This can happen at all levels. This can include people who were involved in partisan activities not only at the federal level, but also at the provincial or municipal level. I do not know if this will also apply to people who work for a union. This is really just a witch hunt that shows contempt for workers in general.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475361">What is even more ironic is that the Conservatives are doing this while refusing to look in the mirror and failing to realize that the partisanship problem is not among the staff of our agents of Parliament, but rather in this government. The problem is within the Conservative Party and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s Office. The Conservatives refuse to see that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475362">That is why I find it completely hypocritical of them to introduce a bill like this, when for months the Conservatives have been refusing to take any action within their own government. I find that completely hypocritical. I think this shows a complete lack of respect for all the people who work hard for the public service and within the offices of our agents of Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475363">The Conservatives are showing just how utterly incapable they are of respecting a job well done. They are incapable of respecting people who really want to improve our Parliament and our country, like the staff at the office of the Commissioner of Official Languages who are fighting so that francophones like me can continue to enjoy the progress we have made. The government is laughing in their faces. This makes absolutely no sense.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475364">I urge all members to vote against this bill.</ParaText>

They are not accountable to the public. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475366">These same people will have the right to look into someone's party affiliation. If someone is chosen to work on a file because he is an objective professional, why is who he votes for in an election a problem? Every citizen is afforded that freedom. This is a democracy, and making political choices is part of our lives.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475367">Last year, the Auditor General did an excellent job and had some criticism for the current government, which was not acting appropriately. This public official wanted to shed some light on the situation, which enabled the official opposition to inform the public that things were not working as they were supposed to.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475368">Now senators can scrutinize those officials if they do not like or are bothered by their work. Those officials were selected to fill their position based on their ability to achieve certain objectives. However, since they are inconveniencing the senators, the latter can decide to harm them, scare them and silence them. That is not good for democracy. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475369">I support any bill that requires us to be more transparent. What I want is a bill that requires the government to tell the truth to the opposition and to Canadians. That is what democracy is about and that is what I stand for. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475370">When we allow a body like the Senate to investigate public officials, that is troubling. Senators are not even elected and are not accountable.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475371">In our system, we already have laws governing these professionals. What, then, is the real purpose of this bill? Let us look at that for a moment. What is the government really trying to do? I think they want to appear to be transparent by demonstrating that they are capable of controlling their officials. Instead they should demonstrate greater transparency by telling the truth and admitting when they make mistakes. That would be better for democracy, instead of coming up with excuses to justify using taxpayers' money. I am referring to one senator in particular who I will not name because everyone knows who I am talking about. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475372">That is what we have to focus on. As elected representatives, we are all accountable and we must respect our commitment to the public. If these officials are doing good work, then why interfere? They can choose to vote for the NDP, the Liberal Party or the Conservative Party. What does it matter if the person has a political past? They are citizens like the rest of us. This is very touchy. These people help us to be more transparent. It is up to each and every one of us to be accountable.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475373">Appointed senators are not accountable to anyone and that poses a threat to democracy. Using taxpayers' money inappropriately is another threat. Transparency must come from each one of us regardless of whether we are part of the opposition or the government.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475374">I do not like the fact that workers are being frightened and told that if they do not do what the government wants, they will be questioned. That brings back bad memories. I come from Chile, a country that was not at all democratic when I was young. In a truly democratic country, people have freedom of expression and we can verify what they say. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475375">We must not undermine democracy. We must not attack public servants who are doing a good job. We must instead go after those who are not doing a good job. We must go after senators who are not doing a good job and who were not even elected. We should investigate those who are in the wrong.</ParaText>

While we certainly support private members' bills coming forward, the government tends to slide its own business through as either government-sponsored bills or through private members' bills, so we never really know what the motivation is behind it.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475383">Let me speak to this. Bill <Document DbId="6251908" Type="4">C-520, an act supporting non-partisan agents of Parliament</Document>, talks about the people who should staff and represent the agents of Parliament. It does not talk about the fact that many of the agents of Parliament need proper resources to carry out their responsibilities under their particular mandate. They have come to committees and reported to the House that they would be in a better position to properly carry out their responsibilities and mandate if they were allocated greater resources and if they had their mandate properly amended to allow them to carry out their responsibilities. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475384">That would be a very positive and constructive piece of legislation and something that we could probably support. However, I do not quite understand why this is here. It talks about the partisan activities of people who work for parliamentary agents, but we already have legislation and regulations that deal with the partisan activities of public servants. We have Part 7 of the Public Service Employment Act, political activities regulations, and the Values and Ethics Code for the Public Service. The only two offices not covered by these pieces of legislation and regulation are the Senate Ethics Officer and the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner. They have their own in-house codes.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475385">I do not understand why this is here. I have to tell the House that as somebody who has been in politics as an elected member for over 15 years and who has been involved in partisan activities, I encourage and applaud citizens who get engaged in the political process. It shows a commitment to their communities and their country. That is a good thing, and it is something that we should encourage. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475386">We should not use it as a detriment. Somebody should be hired or appointed based on the skills, credentials, and experience that they bring to the job; it is not based on their partisan activities. Likewise, I would say that their partisan activities should not be a detriment to their ability to qualify for that position.</ParaText>

They should know that our thoughts and prayers remain with the millions of people who have been affected by this devastation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475428">On Friday, November 8, like all Canadians and indeed people around the world, I reacted with horror when we learned the news that a devastating storm had hit the Philippines. Thousands were feared dead, and homes and infrastructure were destroyed, leaving people without shelter, communications or even the basic survival needs like food and water.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475429">Canadians are a caring and generous people. Indeed, there are no more caring or generous people in the world than the people of Canada. The news of this devastation, not unexpectedly, sparked a strong desire in Canadians to help. As a responsible citizen of the world, Canada has a duty to help, and help we do. We offer assistance when such disasters strike. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475430">I am proud to say that our response was quick and it was decisive. Canada's approach to helping the Philippines is a comprehensive whole-of-government effort led by the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development. It is working hand in hand with core departments and agencies, including National Defence, the Canadian Armed Forces, and Citizenship and Immigration Canada, to deliver support. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475431">As my colleague has indicated, and as members will hear this evening, we deployed a forward party of Canada's disaster assistance response team, the DART, to the region and deployed other elements of the DART capability soon afterwards. DART is Canada's complement of military personnel and assets, ready at a moment's notice to deploy for exactly this sort of emergency. They have unique knowledge and skills to bring relief in the aftermath of humanitarian catastrophe. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475432">More than 300 Canadian Armed Forces personnel are on the ground, right now, in the Philippines, focusing largely in the area of Panay Island that was in the direct path of the typhoon.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475433">Our military is relying on the CC-177 Globemaster and CC-150 Polaris aircraft to move personnel and equipment to where they need to be, and to support our efforts while they are under way. Two Griffon helicopters have also been deployed to assist with transportation of food, non-food items and shelter to remote communities on the ground. I should let the House know that a third helicopter is on its way.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475434">The DART is about to provide clean water to Filipinos through reverse osmosis water purification units. One such unit has been installed, and water purification is expected to start very shortly. A second water purification unit is already on its way. The unit is a truly impressive piece of equipment. It has the ability to purify up to 12,000 gallons of safe drinking water a day.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475435"> I had the pleasure of visiting Canadian Forces Base Trenton last Friday to see off a small contingent of personnel and their specialized equipment, including one of these purification units. Each of them was ready to go and wanting to help, and it made me and indeed anyone who was there very proud to be a Canadian.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475436">As we speak, they are doing amazing work to help Filipinos begin to overcome this tragedy. At a time when engineering, medical and logistical expertise is desperately needed on the ground, the Canadian Armed Forces are able to provide this support to those whose lives depend upon it.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475437">This is a major operation. It is one consistent with the role that Canadians always take when there is an emergency in the world. Again, I am very proud and pleased that we are undertaking this debate.

Sadly, this is not the first time. It happened just a year ago, prior to 2012, with the 2011 typhoon. We have to acknowledge that. The people of the Philippines are a generous people, a resilient people, but this typhoon was the strongest typhoon we have seen. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475454">The effects of the typhoon have been noted. I will go over some of the numbers. They are important to put on the record. Some 8,000 Filipinos had fled to evacuation centres before the typhoon hit. They mobilized, because they knew that this was going to happen. Many of the centres themselves were unable to withstand the tsunami-like storm surges. The winds and the storm were so strong that even the places people went for safe harbour were destroyed.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475455">At least 13 million people have been affected throughout the Philippines. That is half the population of our country. It is hard to even conceptualize. The death toll is about 4,000, but we know that will probably rise as they enter some of the areas government officials and international contingents on the ground have not been able to access. More than 18,000 people were injured and 1,600 people are still missing. That is the latest number.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475456">Clearly, it is a massive disaster. I do not know about you, Mr. Chair, and others in the House, but when we saw the images on television and read the reports, it broke our hearts to see so many vulnerable children without parents, to see whole communities wiped out. It has also taken a toll on the economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475457">The government has responded quickly. We have to keep our eyes on what the next steps are. When we go through a tragedy like this, although each one is different, we need to have an immediate response and get resources on the ground and to the people who are able to deliver the aid and support immediately. We know that people were already on the ground ready to serve and respond. Then it is a matter of coordination and making sure that the aid will not to be stuck. We had that problem in Haiti. We had a lot of problems pushing the aid out to the people who needed it. We need to be vigilant in the Philippines.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475458">Right now there is a vital need to help people go to the next step. We have seen the relief start to have an effect. The next steps are the following: we need to look at rebuilding in the short term to build for the long term, and we need to see cash-for-work programs. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475459">One thing we know from the Haiti experience and the NGOs on the ground is that we need to get people to do that work themselves and we need to pay them to do the work. It is particularly effective when women are paid for work to get things moving, because they are able to distribute the money they get from work to help with their children. That is a really important, smart policy we should be focused on, the cash for work programs that some aid agencies are involved in.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475460">We need to look at farmers. This is an important period of time for farmers and the fisheries. We need to get them the tools. A lot of their tools were wiped out, so we need to look at that in the short term. Aid agencies are looking at that. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475461">We also need to support and protect the most vulnerable people. I mentioned women and children. The vulnerability of women and children is heightened during any catastrophe. We need to be vigilant and make sure that the programs we are funding will protect women and children in particular, but not exclusively.</ParaText>

This December 3, in my own constituency, there will be a fundraiser called “Block Love”. It will be at the Orange Art Gallery in Hintonburg, not far from here. Two women, Anna-Karina Tabunar and Daphne Guerrero, decided that they would do something, and they are organizing a fundraiser on December 3 from 4:30 to 7:30. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475467">That is why it is so important for Canadians to give and for the government to acknowledge that and ensure that the matching funds are there. We are glad to see that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475468">We have a disaster, and we have the response. We have to see the long-term commitment to rebuild.

Right now, in Poland, where the negotiations have been going on, we have the delegate from the Philippines on a hunger strike, because he understands that this is about climate change. This is a genuine plea to the members of the current government. If they have the sense to follow up on the aid to the Philippines, they can do that by genuinely acknowledging that the effects of climate change are affecting the people of the Philippines more than we could ever know. If we are serious about helping the people of the Philippines, the next step for the government is to be serious about climate change, negotiate in good faith, acknowledge the science of climate change, and start helping to reduce CO<Sub>2</Sub> emissions. It is the people of the Philippines, the people of sub-Saharan Africa, and the people of the north who are most affected by climate change and who contribute the least to climate change.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475470">I have given the Conservatives credit for responding, but I passionately urge them to acknowledge that climate change is the big player here. We have to be serious about this. It is with great sadness that we see these deaths occur. However, we have to acknowledge that we need to prevent this from happening. Some say that it is too late. I say that we have to do what we can. Let us acknowledge the delegate from the Philippines at the climate change talks in Poland right now, who is on a hunger strike trying to get attention from the world and from Canada, and actually be serious about climate change.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475471">I want to finish by acknowledging every Canadian who has contributed, but I particularly underline the Filipino Canadian community, whom I know personally in places like Winnipeg, here in Ottawa, and Vancouver. We all know and have friends throughout the country who are Filipino Canadians. They are resilient and passionate. They are the ones who have been the first responders. Let us stay with them. Let us not abandon them. Let us ensure that Canada is in it for the long haul and that we work in solidarity with the people of the Philippines and do not turn our backs. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475472">Let us continue this debate in a constructive way to look for solutions to help the people in the Philippines in the short term and the long term and make sure that we do not forget them.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Some people think the best thing to do is to take material goods, pack them together and send them to some of the organizations that are sending relief abroad. We want to underline the fact that is not helpful because of the expense of sending those goods. If anything, people could have a garage sale to raise some cash and donate that to the appropriate organizations. People of goodwill will want to do things in the way they see best fit, but we have to remind them that money is the way to do it. As my friend from Manitoba said, there are organizations that already have people on the ground, they have the infrastructure and they are ready to respond.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475488">On that note, I mentioned that together.ca is one of the ways people can go online to donate. It is website of the Humanitarian Coalition, which is a couple of registered NGOs that have come together to put their resources together, a one-stop shop. UNICEF is doing great work. There are a number of organizations. I think the department has ways to access those organizations.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475489">The other thing I want to mention is that this is an opportunity reach out to our fellow Canadians. I mentioned one of the events coming up in my riding. As parliamentarians, we should connect with our communities to find out what is going on, promote those activities and get people to connect with each other. It is very isolating if people have family members who are going through this crisis right now. They are alone and are trying to deal with it. This is a time when we, as Canadians and as members of Parliament showing leadership, donate personally, but also promote those opportunities for people to come together.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475490">I remember well the earthquake in Haiti, its aftermath and some of the events that happened in my riding.

However, given the lessons we have all learned from the tragedy in the Haiti, would the government consider two other measures? Would the government extend the deadline for matching funds until the end of the calendar year? Would the government grant visa extensions for students, temporary workers and workers from the typhoon area?</ParaText><ParaText id="3475502">We expect financial support to increase as more information becomes available. Official estimates of what it may cost to rebuild and restore the affected areas of the Philippines now runs to almost $6 billion and many survivors will be dependent on aid for months to come. We do not want the government to think that this money is the end of Canada's role in this tragic event. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475503">Canada is home to a significant Filipino diaspora and we must be ready to do more in the future when called upon by the international community.</ParaText>

They certainly need assistance and they may be part of the group that should be prioritized, to use the word that the government is using, to come more quickly to Canada or else to receive aid in the Philippines from Doctors Without Borders or one of our aid agencies.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475537">I certainly agree that cases like that at the time of a crisis such as this are frequently very urgent in nature, so whether the assistance is on the ground in the Philippines through an NGO or to come quickly to Canada, in either case speed may be of the essence and there ought to be a high degree of urgency. I commend the government overall for responding quickly, but in particular areas such as my colleague raises, there may be a need for speedier action than we have so far observed.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

However, I am with her on the DART.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475541">She talked about immigration and I thought we were talking about the Philippines. Instead, she drags out her PMO talking points, which are absolutely false, on immigration. As I have made clear in the House, in the last five years under Conservative rule, the average waiting time for family class immigrants has gone from 13 months to 34 months. That is almost a tripling under Conservative rule. The waiting times, as I indicated, for live-in caregivers from the Philippines, which is what we are talking about now, is over three years. For parents and grandparents, it is over five years. This is dramatically higher than it was five years ago.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475542">These PMO talking points about Liberals and immigration are utterly false and the challenge for these Conservatives is to get their own act together on immigration and bring down these terribly high waiting times, which are wreaking havoc on the new Canadians of this country.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Those of us who are praying people have been praying for them over the last few days, and our prayers continue for those who have been affected by the devastation of Typhoon Haiyan.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475575">It is truly staggering. I do not think we can really understand how many lives have been impacted by this disaster. We are hearing that an estimated 13 million people have been affected across the Philippines, with the passing of a single storm, with over 4 million people put out of their homes and more than 4,000 people who lost their lives. For us who are at a distance, it is a very difficult thing to even be able to comprehend those numbers.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475576">Many other people have been impacted as well. There are people across Canada who have had to wait days to find out about their friends and families.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475577">I want to quickly tell members about my area. It has only been 100 years since my area was settled, and that in itself is a remarkable story about how settlers came from around the world. They settled in western Canada. They lived together and built a society that has become a successful model and has become the heartland of the nation of Canada.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475578">We have always relied on immigration in our province. Over the last decade, in particular, as the economy has really grown and bloomed, we have turned to other nations to send us their best, and we have relied on people coming in from other countries to expand our economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475579">The Philippines has been one of those nations that has provided us with some of the best, great new Canadians. In my own small community of only 350 people, we now have 17 Filipino families. We have a manufacturing plant, and it has turned to these families and relied on them to come to our country. These are families who have chosen to live here, and they are invaluable in our community.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475580"> Throughout southwestern Saskatchewan, throughout the riding of <Affiliation DbId="170577" Type="2">Cypress Hills—Grasslands</Affiliation>, we now have members from the Filipino community in virtually every community in the riding, and they bring a spirit that has been a great asset to our communities.

We have an active local Filipino association that is under the leadership of a young man named Emilio Completo. They decided to hold a fundraiser for their folks back home. They had volunteers from communities such as the Latin American community, the local Swift Current community and communities around my riding. The response from my area of southwestern Saskatchewan was actually amazing. The local area donated $21,458, which is going to be matched by federal government contributions. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475583">The local association has been very active over the past few years. It intends to target this money to solve some of those short-term problems that we talked about tonight and then to actually deal with some of the longer term problems as well. They want to try to take care of immediate needs in the areas that have been most devastated, and they look forward to having a good discussion in their community about how they then might move on to share in some of the things like rebuilding schools, perhaps, and other projects that will be important.</ParaText>

The minister mentioned that she was in Winnipeg last week meeting with leaders in the Filipino community, and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has met a number of times with leaders of the Filipino community, and that has led to good communication with them and then the type of response we have seen.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475586">I understand my time is already wrapping up, but I too want to acknowledge the great generosity of the people of southwestern Saskatchewan and the incredible leadership of Emilio and the Filipino association in Swift Current, Saskatchewan, in bringing the community together to support people who are so far away but who need our help so much.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It is Canadians of all stripes, shapes and sizes who are more than happy and willing to participate and help out, because that is what we do.

Chris Alexander (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3475668">Mr. Chair, I am thankful for the opportunity to speak tonight in this important debate on a subject that has really touched all Canadians, not just those of Filipino heritage but all of us whose friends, neighbours and fellow citizens in communities of every size, as we have already heard in the debate tonight, have been affected. All of us have seen the images on television, not just of a storm, not just of a natural disaster, but of a devastating typhoon of an unprecedented scale that has left a big region of a big country reeling and has driven millions of people, without any warning, into a condition of acute humanitarian need.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475669">What are we seeing across Canada just in this past week and a half? We are seeing an extraordinary response, a very modern phenomenon whereby the Canadian government is able to act quickly. Canadians have responded with enormous generosity. Information has been flowing in because the Philippines is a country wired to us very closely and where information moves, even in conditions of natural disasters such as this, relatively quickly. That has made our response faster, more effective and larger in scale than perhaps we have ever seen in a case so far away from our shores in our history of humanitarian response.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475670">What is at the bottom of Canada's ability to do this? There is a certain resilience, and I take particular pride as Minister of Citizenship and Immigration in the fact that we now have a strong, successful Filipino Canadian community in Canada, many of whom are relatively recent to Canada from the Philippines, who still have relatives and friends there who they know, are in contact with and to whom they have often been sending millions of dollars in remittances, which themselves are a major source of income for the Philippines. It is this group that has led our response. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475671">Yes, the Government of Canada has done a great deal. We have heard about it tonight and we will hear more, but we are extremely proud of our Filipino Canadian co-citizens who have led the way, have shown us the way, in many respects, and whose presence here, linked back to the Philippines, is giving our relationship with that faraway country great resilience and great dynamism at this time.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475672">There is also a question of our economy in that Canada would not have the resources and our Filipino Canadian recent arrivals and those who have been here longer would not be able to remit as much back home were it not for the economic opportunity here. It is another example of why having an economic plan and economic success pays benefits not just in times of prosperity but in times of hardship and acute need, as we are seeing in the Philippines today. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475673">There is also a question of logistics. It is banal, and I know colleagues opposite do not often speak of these questions for predictable reasons, but the DART would not have been there as quickly as it arrived, the medical teams would not be there, the helicopters and other lift would not be there were it not for the fact that this government has acquired C-17 strategic-lift long-distance transport aircraft, which have made it possible to get heavy loads halfway around the world efficiently and actually save lives. Resilience, economic success and good logistics all play a role.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475674">On this side, we are absolutely governed in this debate by our sympathy for those who are still suffering and the relatives of those still in need. Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have lost loved ones and homes, the families who have been injured, have lost livelihoods and do not see the future clearly from where they sit in the Eastern or Western Visayas, on the island of Leyte, on the island of Cebu, on the island of Panay. Our condolences go to those who have lost loved ones and our solidarity goes to all those who are still struggling to get through this crisis.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="15">(2115)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3475675">However, in a time of crisis our message, which we have heard from our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> from the very beginning and again this week, is one of reassurance: “Canada will be with you”. We are confident in leading a strong Canadian effort, not just by government but by the Filipino Canadian community and by Canadians across the board, who have been enormously generous. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475676">We heard the Prime Minister adding $15 million to our previously announced efforts at the beginning of this week. We heard that $20 million has already been donated by Canadians, and that will be matched by the Government of Canada. This is good news for those who are still waiting to have their needs looked after.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475677">The DART, the Disaster Assistance Response Team, has done a fantastic job on Iloilo in the province of Capiz, as well on the island of Panay. This is the kind of emergency for which the DART was conceived. It is absolutely wonderful to see it deployed in record time and to see it doing that tremendously effective job on the ground. We know that the Canadian Forces, whether in a humanitarian mode or a combat mode, are second to none in the world, and we are very proud of what they are doing today, tonight, and all this week in the Philippines.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475678">As I said earlier, we are also proud of a community that now numbers over 600,000 members in Canada, the Filipino Canadian community. Let me remind the House that in 2012 the Philippines was the second-largest source country for immigration to Canada. Just over 32,700 permanent residents were admitted to Canada last year from the Philippines, a 146% increase since 2004, and we are looking for that trend to continue. We have committed to bringing 17,500 live-in caregivers to Canada next year as part of our effort to deal with a backlog in that area that grew up under the Liberals and went unaddressed for too long. Many of those spaces will be taken up by Filipino Canadians if the past is any indicator.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475679">Despite the seriousness of tonight's subject, we continue to have detours from the opposition into strange spaces. For some reason, opposition members think this is all about climate change, that if we had just negotiated harder in Warsaw maybe this storm would not have happened and the emergency would not be under way. We disagree. There are people on the ground, millions of them, who need aid, and hunger strikes in Warsaw and debates on climate change at this stage are not the solution, just as looking into the root causes of terrorism was not the right response to a tragedy on the day of the Boston Marathon, and just as it is not appropriate for Liberal members to waste time, in an important debate that they asked for, talking about the time frame for family reunification.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475680"> This is a program that was a disaster under the Liberals. Everyone knows backlogs have been halved under our government. Everyone knows the situation is better, that we have the largest and most effective team we have ever had in Manila, and that we are bringing record numbers of permanent residents, temporary foreign workers, and visitors from the Philippines under this government. We are proud of that record, proud to build on it, and proud to give members those numbers tonight.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475681">I am proud of what our colleagues are doing on this side. The member for <Affiliation DbId="170148" Type="2">Newmarket—Aurora</Affiliation>, who is speaking as part of today's debate, attended a fundraising musical concert that was organized by a movement of Filipino Canadians across the greater Toronto area. Countless of my colleagues have been doing this in communities large and small. I myself was at St. Francis de Sales Church in Ajax, where many members of the congregation trace their roots to the Philippines, and I saw the generosity of not just Filipino Canadian parishioners but of everyone in responding to this need.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475682"> We in the Department of Citizenship and Immigration are doing our part by expediting passport processing and giving priority to the applications of those who want to be permanent residents, those who want to be visitors to Canada, and those whose applications we had but who are from the affected areas and who really need the benefit of friends and family support in Canada more urgently than anyone else. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475683">We call on Canadians to help us identify those cases. We have identified hundreds of them. We have had thousands of calls relating to these kinds of cases, but we put out our message to everyone in this House and across Canada to help us to meet the needs of those who deserve our help at this time. Help us to do it by expediting these applications. Help us to replace documents that were lost in the typhoon. Help us to ensure that Canada remains at the absolute forefront of relief efforts in the Philippines, a country we have never been closer to.</ParaText>

Let us be honest. We were not saying that someone on a hunger strike who is representing the Philippines would have stopped. I think he would appreciate that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475688">In the spirit of this debate about sharing best ideas and putting forward ideas, I would hope the minister is not going to go down that path. We were simply mentioning that someone was on a hunger strike. There is a climate change conference on. We think it is part of the equation here. My colleague was simply referring to a representative of the Philippines who made the comment in Toronto. He is someone we work with and have good diplomatic relations with.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475689">I know we have a different point of view on climate change. The government does not believe it is as important as we might; however, let us try to put that aside. I think the minister was implying that somehow we thought that just supporting someone on a hunger strike in this case was enough. Clearly that is not the case. We have all donated. We are supporting the government on its donations. I would just like to try to shift us back to that spirit of the debate.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

That is why we are in that province and the province of Capiz.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475692">We are there at the request of the Filipino government.

							<ParaText id="3475694"> As the member knows, the typhoon went from east to west across the middle of the Philippines, from Eastern Visayas to Western Visayas. Three big islands were in its path: Leyte, where Tacloban is; Cebu, in the middle, where we have a visa application centre and where we are giving additional access for people who may need that expedited priority processing; and Panay, a very big island, with the city of Roxas in the north, which is not in good shape.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It is mostly, obviously, on the military side and the consular side because there was an acute need there to track Canadians, many of them still missing. That role is not a particularly large one in normal times in the Philippines. Our immigration program is a large one, one of the largest we have in the world. It is being adjusted. It is being supported, but it is handling prioritized cases within its already very large workload quite well.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475741">There was a very important point made by the member opposite about the future for the Philippines and other countries. Would the member not agree with us that the best investment that can be made with the support of donor countries, but also by countries subject to typhoons and earthquakes and other natural disasters themselves, is to build that resilience, to build that ability to respond quickly and to prevent the kind of damage that is much worse when preparations have not been made? </ParaText>

Climate change adaptation is the term that has been used by the government and by others. Part of that is recognizing it, not just in developing countries or in far-flung places in the world, but right here in Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475744">In Alberta, in Toronto and in Mississauga there were effects of storms this summer that were unthinkable, and they clearly displayed that some parts of this country are not prepared for the worst-case scenario and for the scenarios we likely are going to see more of, as a result of global climate change. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475745">We welcome the government responding “yes” when the City of Toronto asks it for help with infrastructure spending in order to prevent the kind of property damage that occurred because its sewer systems could not handle the rain that fell in this last storm.

							<ParaText id="3475769">Our natural instinct in times of crisis and times of danger like this, when there is storm of this magnitude bearing down on us, is to run and get cover. We have citizens in our country who do the exact opposite. Of course, I am speaking of the brave men and women who serve in the Canadian Armed Forces as part of our Disaster Assistance Response Team, DART. Sure, they are military members of the Canadian Armed Forces, the Air Force, and the Royal Canadian Navy. These are soldiers, but they are armed with shovels, water, smiles, and medicine. They are going out there proudly wearing the maple leaf on their uniforms as a unit crest. It is a simple yet poignant moto on the uniform that says “Humanitas”.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475770">Just a week ago, these members were sitting in their homes, unaware that they were going to be called. It really is a credit to the training, expertise, and readiness of the Canadian Armed Forces that it is always in a position to deploy the DART team. Now they are sitting in the middle of a major disaster zone, but they are bringing much needed help and assistance to Panay Island in the Philippines.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475771">We all know that the story of DART is an important one. It is a story that all of us as Canadians are justifiably proud of. DART has proven time and time again that it can make a crucial difference in people's lives around the world. It does this by offering medical aid, engineering, logistical support, and of course, safe drinking water, the basis of healthy human life. DART can act as a stabilization resource immediately after an emergency. That is exactly what we are seeing. This way, it is bridging the gap between the disaster that has already hit hard and the arrival of civilian actors, NGOs, and those who are in the business of dealing with humanitarian aid and will be there to provide the long-term assistance that will be so desperately needed in the recovery from Typhoon Haiyan.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475772">DART works alongside local authorities, first and foremost, non-governmental organizations from around the world, and international agencies, such as the United Nations. They will be there until regular services are able to be restored by the local governments.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="00">(2200)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3475773">Canadians and the international community have seen the great work of DART many times already. For example, in 2010, when Haiti was hit by the devastating earthquake, the Canadian Armed Forces had boots on the ground in less than 24 hours after the disaster. That included search and rescue personnel, medics and firefighters, and they were all directly helping the people in Haiti. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475774">We have learned many lessons from the previous demanding missions, realizing just how important and challenging a rapid deployment is. We have been maintaining a flexible and rapid response capability and we know that is critical to the success of disaster relief operations where every few hours can save thousands of lives.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475775"> People are watching the TV right now and seeing all the different reports coming in. They know that when there are corpses still being collected and livestock carcasses laying all around, those situations are not only disease potential vectors, but also can cause contamination of the water source. We have to ensure that all of this gets cleaned up, that the infrastructure gets restored as quickly as possible and that the water is purified to ensure the sustainability of people's lives.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475776">It is thanks to all the lessons that we have learned for the readiness, the training, the expertise of our people, as well as our equipment, as the <Affiliation DbId="194611" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship and Immigration</Affiliation> has already talked about. The Canadian Armed Forces are now set to answer the call for help whenever it comes and they are proving it right now in the Philippines. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475777">The first step was for the military to deploy to the Philippines as part of the Government of Canada's assessment team. It was on the ground very quickly, understood immediately what the needs were and started working with the Philippine government to determine where our DART capabilities were best going to be used. We responded quickly and got our resources into our area of focus, which is Panay Island. Since then, we have opened our headquarters in the city of Roxas, with operations focusing on the northeast coast of the island, an area that was in the direct path of the typhoon, an area that is still not accessible by road, an area where much of the country has yet to pay any attention because of all the other devastation in other parts of the Philippines. What we are seeing on TV, of course, is Tacloban.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475778">There are already over 300 members of the Canadian Armed Forces on the ground and this is all part of the DART. These are people with medical expertise, doctors, nurses and medics. There is logistical support and engineers, who are very important for restoring the infrastructure. We are using C-17 Globemasters and 150 Polaris aircraft. They are doing the strategic heavy lifting, getting personnel and equipment into the Philippines, which is over half the world away, over 16,000 kilometres. There are two Griffon helicopters that have already been deployed. Part of the team was able to fly in and give us mobility to get to the parts of Panay Island that we would not able to get to otherwise. They are getting in before the roads are cleared. A third helicopter is actually slated to arrive later tonight.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475779">The work that our military personnel have been able to accomplish so far is quite impressive. We have a reverse osmosis water purification unit that has been installed and tested, and that will start providing purified water very shortly. A second unit is in transit right now. These water purification units will provide up to 50,000 litres of drinking water every day. That is going to make a difference in the lives of many people affected by this disaster.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475780">Our men in uniform are also doing other important work, such as clearing the roads between different cities on the island and allowing vital transportation routes to reopen. They have already reopened 36 kilometres. They have also installed and repaired the generator in the hospital in Roxas so they can immediately start doing surgeries. We know that hospital has already been able to handle patients. As well, the medical team has already seen over 400 patients since it arrived.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475781"> This is what is really important. There is still much work to be done, but with its equipment, training and experience, DART is in its element, working with the authorities of the Philippines and our international partners, like the UN, to ensure that the help we provide meets the needs of the people of the Philippines.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It does not cost anything to send it. One can send it by wire and it gets over there. Then people can buy the food, the clothing and the supplies from the local economy. When they bring in canned goods, clothing, or other consumer needs, they are actually depressing the local economy. This way people will be able to help those who are not now going to have many business opportunities because everyone is so busy rebuilding. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475812">Pretty much everyone there lived from paycheque to paycheque and at very low salaries at that. Therefore, it is important that we support the local farmers, local shops and that we get those goods, supplies and food stocks into the hands of those who need them.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475813"> The best way to do that is to work through major organizations like World Vision, the Red Cross, UNICEF, United Way and Mennonite Central Committee. I know there are so many others that are active right now in collecting those dollars. They have the expertise and the knowledge of dealing with humanitarian crises around the world.

As we understand, it has displaced an estimated four million people, which is more than those displaced by the Indian Ocean tsunami and Hurricane Katrina combined, with more than half a million homes completely destroyed. It is our understanding that at least 13 million people have been affected throughout the Philippines, with over 4,000 people estimated to have died, 18,000 injured and 16,000 people still missing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475816">I want to begin my comments this evening by extending my sincere sympathies to all those affected, obviously the Filipino population who have been so devastated by this terrible event, but also the many friends and family members and colleagues around the world who have been affected as well. It has created terrible uncertainty, terrible worry, and it has also mobilized people around the world to act as quickly as possible.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475817">I want to especially extend sympathies to the Filipino community in my riding of Parkdale—High Park. I have reached out to the community centre, to Kababayan Multicultural Centre, which is the heart of the Filipino community in Parkdale—High Park. I know it has served many newcomers of Filipino descent to our area, and today continues to work with those Canadians of Filipino descent, including seniors and young people as well as other community members needing assistance. The people at the community centre perform wonderful work in services, language training and job help. I want to specifically offer to the executive director, Flordeliz Dandal, with whom I have worked so often in the community, and all of the staff and volunteers and to Aguido Dela Cruz, the chairperson of the board, and to all the board members and all members of the Filipino community, my sincere sympathies.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475818"> I did have the opportunity last week to meet briefly with the ambassador from the Philippines. I asked him what we as members of Parliament can do. He encouraged us to encourage people to donate, to contribute funds so we can get aid as quickly as possible to those affected. I went this week to the embassy here in Ottawa and signed a book of condolences that the ambassador is compiling and will be sent to the Filipino Canadian community.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475819">I note that the international community has pulled together quite quickly to work to provide aid for relief efforts, and the international aid commitment so far has reached nearly $248 million. In addition, the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank have readied $500 million in loans to help finance the reconstruction, because of course reconstruction will be enormous once the immediate needs of people in terms of water, food, shelter and clothing have been taken care of. Canada's commitment of $20 million so far, including $15 million to match funds that have been donated by Canadians, as well as mobilizing relief efforts and our DART members to provide direct assistance is extremely welcome. We thank the government for this very quick action.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="15">(2215)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3475820"> I want to hit home to people who are listening from our community in Parkdale—High Park, or anywhere in the Toronto area, or indeed across Canada. We have an opportunity right now to secure matching funds from the federal government. We applaud this initiative, so the best relief, the best initiative that people can offer is to donate so that the money can get quickly translated into relief and aid on the ground.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475821">There are a number of fundraising initiatives taking place in local communities. People can donate online through organizations such as Migrante Canada, which does such terrific work with caregivers from the Filipino community. They can work through Kababayan in Parkdale—High Park, or people can donate directly to humanitarian organizations, the Humanitarian Coalition, the Canadian Red Cross, World Vision, UNICEF, whatever their preferred recognized charity is that knows how to translate this money quickly into action on the ground.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475822">I also note one specific event in which I am going to be participating in a couple of weeks. It is being organized by Long &amp; McQuade Musical Instruments in Toronto. There is a singing contest with John Santos and we are going to be singing to raise funds for the victims of Typhoon Haiyan. That is Friday, December 6, at Casa Da Madeira Community Centre on Dupont Street in Toronto.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475823">One further point I would like to make is that this typhoon was especially hard-hitting for the Filipino community because so many people of Filipino origin in Canada, and indeed in other countries around the world, are separated from families back home. Many people of Filipino origin have come here to Canada to work as caregivers in people's homes, or in the health care sector. Often these are people who have left their own families and children behind. They have missed milestones in their children's lives because they may be caring for other people's children. That presents its own special hardship, but when they are separated and something disastrous happens such as this typhoon, it is especially gut-wrenching for people separated from their loved ones.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475824">Many who come here to Canada want to sponsor family members. We meet with people from the Filipino community in our constituency office regularly. They are trying to sponsor family members and it is a very long wait. This has an even bigger impact on them.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475825">In addition to urging people to donate so that we can get matching funds from the federal government, I would also urge the federal government to do what it can to speed up family reunification, applications for permanent residence, the immigration process, so that people who are separated from family members can be reunited and be assured that their loved ones are safe and sound.</ParaText>

Carte International, a wonderful company where a lot of people with Filipino heritage work, gave my office a call because it wanted to have a Philippine flag on its float for the Santa Claus parade. The company raised thousands of dollars the previous night for a social. We had groups that were there for prayer services at numerous churches within the community. We had senior groups getting together and soliciting donations. The Association of Ilocano of Manitoba had a giant fundraiser where a great deal of money was made, all to try to help. It has touched the hearts of all Canadians in some fashion or another. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475829">As we reflect on it here this evening, we should emphasize that it is so wonderful to see Canadians as a whole coming together to support another great nation. It is a nation with which we have been building a healthier and more prosperous relationship over the last number of years, a relationship that deals with more than immigration. It hopes to build more in terms of trade and so forth, and to help both countries.

They do remain in my thoughts and prayers.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475851">The images we are seeing on a daily basis and the stories of the victims as well as those of their families here in Canada are heart wrenching. The destruction of lives, livelihoods and infrastructure is staggering. General estimates are that the number of those affected is between 10 million and 13 million people in nine regions and that nearly 40% of those affected are from central Visayas.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475852">The UN estimates that some 2.5 million people are in dire need of food assistance. Also, at least 5.1 million workers across the affected areas have lost their livelihoods. As members can see, this is a truly serious situation, and this government has stepped up.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475853">Canada has been standing with the Philippine people from day one of this terrible tragedy. In fact, even before it hit, our government realized the severity and dangers the typhoon posed. Our government reacted pre-emptively to ensure that relief operations would be ready to go as soon as possible.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475854"> We allocated $30,000 to the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to help them prepare their relief operations. On the day the storm made landfall, November 9, our Canadian government provided $5 million in support for the provision of emergency shelter, water, food and other essential services. On November 10, our government committed itself further to relief efforts when the hon. <Affiliation DbId="194623" Type="4">Minister of International Development</Affiliation> announced the Typhoon Haiyan relief fund. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475855">This fund will match the eligible donations Canadians make to registered Canadian charities over a four-week period, and I would just like to correct the record: it is from November 9 to December 9, 2013. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475856">On November 18, the right hon. <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> announced that Canada would contribute $15 million to aid efforts. Now today, the hon. <Affiliation DbId="194623" Type="4">Minister of International Development</Affiliation> announced further support of needed supplies that will come from DFATD's emergency stockpile.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475857">This means the contribution of the Government of Canada is the fourth largest in the world to the relief effort. Canada's contribution will increase even further when the matching fund closes. It is encouraging that after only a few days the fund is close to $20 million. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475858">Canadians are generous people. With nearly three weeks to go, imagine how much impact they will end up having toward helping the Filipino people. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475859">It is not only monetary contributions that have made our government's and country's response so effective and successful. On November 13, the right hon. <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> announced that our renowned disaster assistance response team, DART, would deploy to Iloilo. In Iloilo, DART has provided clean water, emergency medical aid and logistical support. The amazing work of the DART cannot be overstated. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475860">I must also commend my colleague, the <Affiliation DbId="194632" Type="4">Minister of National Defence</Affiliation>, for the outstanding job he has done in making sure the team responded effectively and continues to do so.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475861">From the very first moment DART set foot in the Philippines, it has been instrumental and successful in providing immediate assistance in this complex humanitarian emergency. I will tell members just a few of the things that DART did yesterday.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475862">Two DART mobile medical teams provided medical services, while another mobile medical team provided similar services in Panay. Also, engineers were clearing the road, one of the many roads they have been clearing so that aid can reach areas that were cut off. In President Roxas in the eastern Capiz province, engineers also set up a water purifier capable of providing 50,000 litres of safe drinking water a day. Since landing in the Philippines, the DART engineering team has also repaired a hospital generator, which has allowed staff to undertake critical surgical operations.</ParaText>

On the <I>Power &amp; Politics with Evan Solomon</I> show, Mr. Elsharkawi applauded our government's response and the response and generosity of the Canadian people. He said,“This is absolutely welcome news. Canadians have been generous so far. They continue to be generous with this particular disaster and others”.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475870">I am also happy to see that our government's contributions have also been marked by my hon. colleagues across the aisle.

And I think the short-term response of the government is good”.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475874">Although the House is usually the scene of highly charged party politics, it is good to see that our parties can have the same view when it comes to dealing with a natural disaster. I want to sincerely thank my colleagues for their comments and their support. It is apparent that all parties realize that we must put the safety and well-being of others before everything else, including party politics. That is what has driven our response to help our fellow human being.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475875">This past Sunday, I attended a fundraising event in Mississauga organized by a grassroots group of Filipino Canadians. I congratulate Julius and his team of volunteers who organized a lively program of music, dance and martial arts demonstrations to keep the audience engaged.

There would be a good deal of self-interest in that too, because we can help around the world, but we know we are also vulnerable. The more we are ready to respond to what might happen here, the more it makes sense to be developing that capacity, let us call it a specialty, around the globe.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475879">I am wondering if there is anything in what I have said that might appeal to the government benches in terms of the future development of the armed forces.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We saw the work it did in Haiti, and the people of Haiti were incredibly thankful for that contribution.

I know how much my colleague is involved and how much he is helping.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475901">That said, it is important to note that disasters have happened and will happen again, and that we as Canadians will respond in good faith. Sometimes we will respond faster than others and sometimes we will allocate more resources than other times. There have been times that the current government has responded, but it has gone there screaming and yelling, and there have been times that it has responded right away.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475902">Let us examine those times, because it is very important to do so.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475903">When Haiti happened, the government immediately responded. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> went to the Red Cross and made his donation, and the cameras were following him. We were at the time of proroguing. The House of Commons was shut down.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475904">When Haiyan happened in the Philippines, the government responded immediately. This time, we had one of the second-highest hitters, the <Affiliation DbId="170677" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation>, writing his cheque when the camera was there. How appropriate. We have seen his good spirit, and the government again is going through a crisis consisting of senators Duffy, Wallin, and Brazeau.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475905">When the earthquake in China happened in 2008, there was no response for a couple of days. We had to force the government time and again before it responded. At that point in time, overwhelmingly the massive support was happening from the Chinese community. It collected millions of dollars, bought tents that were shipped over courtesy of Air Canada, and the Red Cross transferred the money to the Chinese Red Cross. That was all done primarily through community involvement.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475906">A couple of years ago, another typhoon hit the Philippines, and the current government did not act.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475907">However, this time it did act, and what did it put in place? The Conservatives put in place the Liberal protocol for disasters, the protocol that the Liberal government before them had in place for years. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475908">Let us examine that. There were four pillars to it. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475909">One was to expedite family class immigration processing from the areas that were affected, and if anybody was in Canada, to ensure they could stay in Canada until the disaster back home was looked after. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475910">The second was to make the DART available.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475911">The third was to work with communities and match dollar for dollar any funding that they raised for a great length of time. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475912">The fourth was that we would help the communities to help themselves. For any money that they raised, we would respond quickly to ensure we were able to provide a one-time CRA tax donation number so they could issue tax receipts for the money they collected.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475913">This is being done today by the Conservatives, and we from this side agree with them that what they have done is great. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475914">However, we heard tonight that there is no extra allocation of staff at the post in the Philippines. Immigration has absolutely no extra staff to deal with this situation. The immigration officials in the Philippines are overwhelmed. The immigration officials in the Philippines have to deal with thousands of cases. They just got off a strike a number of months ago, so not only do we overburden them, but we also do not provide any extra staff. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475915">The other thing we do not hear is the goodwill of Christmas that would allow for the community to respond until Christmas.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475916">I do want to express through my speech my condolences to the families of the people who have been affected. My prayers and thoughts are with them, and I join them in their fight to overcome this. On December 4, on a Wednesday night, IDRF, the International Development and Relief Foundation, will be having an event in Toronto that I will be attending.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475917"> I am looking forward to continuing this conversation. I do hope that the Conservatives will stand up and say that more staff is going out to help immigration officials and that the time will be extended until December 31 in order for us to continue to raise more money. </ParaText>

He described some of them as caring and giving. I have many friends and families who live in my community. I would like to add hard-working and resilient.

If they have a family member who has been identified in the affected areas how should they be alerting the officials? What should they be doing? Should they be getting in touch with their barangay captains? What should they be doing in their communities to alert Canadian officials so we can actually help them with the family reunification process?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We talk about those traits that we believe are all good about humanity. I witnessed that first-hand in the Philippines, when I had been there after a disaster occurred. I was able to work with local officials to literally put bags of rice into the hands of children. It is a wonderful thing to see a community come together to help out.

It has also been well enunciated, both by members on this side and on the opposite side, about the great human tragedy we have been witnessing in the Philippines. From the jaws of that great tragedy, we have seen the best of Canada. A lot of people have spoken about the great things many Canadians have been doing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475956"> The riding of York Centre, the riding I am so fortunate to represent, is a very ethnocultural riding. We boast one of the largest Filipino communities of any riding in the country. Over the past couple of weeks, we have been working closely with the Filipino community to help alleviate much of the humanitarian crisis that has been occurring in the Philippines.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475957">It has not stopped there. What we attempted to do last week in York Centre really is a model that should be duplicated across the country. It is a model because it exhibits what the great Canadian family stands for. We know that when one member of a family is down, it is incumbent upon and the responsibility of other members of that family to reach down and pull that other family member up. That is what we have seen in the riding of York Centre.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475958">Let me be more specific. Last week I got on the phone and called up a number of different faith leaders in the riding of York Centre. I called different churches and synagogues. I asked the religious leaders what they were doing the following day at one o'clock. All of them had plans, but I told them what I wanted to do, which was to organize an event whereby different faith leaders would stand, side by side, shoulder to shoulder, in support of the Filipino people.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475959">Every one of them said “I am busy, but because of what you want to do, Mark, we will be there at one o'clock. We will drop all of our plans and be there”.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475960">What we did was organize an event. It started off as a prayer session. We had six different pastors from six different ethnic churches and a rabbi. We gathered outside of Yummy Market, which is in the heart of York Centre. Yummy Market is the central place for the Russian-speaking community. That is where they do all of their shopping. We have the largest Russian-speaking community of any riding in the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475961">We had all these different faith leaders come to Yummy Market. We called up Plan Canada, one of the designated charities, where dollars will be matched dollar for dollar. We got Plan Canada involved and we got cans from it to place at the checkout counters in Yummy Market. We have been encouraging other retailers throughout the riding of York Centre to accept these cans.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475962">What we are doing is when consumers make their purchases and they are checking out of the different retail store counters, we are asking them to deposit change into these cans. These cans will be given to Plan Canada and in turn sent over to the Philippines for humanitarian relief.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475963">Yummy Market was the first to accept these cans. We had all these different faith leaders. We had a lot of ethnic media turn out for the event. It is so important. What that demonstrates is the best of Canada. When one member of our community is down, all members of our community come to the rescue and come to stand side by side, shoulder to shoulder, with all of its other members.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475964">That is so heartwarming to see. Now we have those cans for collecting coins in dozens of retail outlets across the riding of York Centre.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="23" Mn="15">(2315)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3475965">As we were wrapping up the event, a woman came over to me and said, “I have a problem with your cans, Mark. I have dollar bills I want to put in, and I can only put change in”.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475966">People want to help. People want to give. This humanitarian crisis has really demonstrated the best Canada has to offer. It demonstrates that our country is a great champion of human dignity.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I want to begin by offering my heartfelt sympathy and support to all those within the Filipino community who have been impacted by the terrible tragedy of Typhoon Haiyan. My thoughts and prayers are with the entire Filipino Canadian community at a time that is desperate for so many.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475981">Canada is working hard to ease the suffering of the people affected by the typhoon that swept through the Philippines nearly two weeks ago. As a clearer picture of the full impact of the storm emerges, we know that as many as 13 million people have been affected and that more than 4 million people have been displaced. More than 1 million houses have been either damaged or outright destroyed. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475982">Contributions in response to the typhoon are pouring in from all over the world. We are already starting to see the positive impact that international assistance is making in the lives of those affected by this terrible tragedy. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475983">Canada continues to be deeply concerned for the people of the Philippines, and we have been a leading player in the international response. We continue to work through both Canadian and international partners to alleviate suffering and save lives, in response to the crisis. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475984">Canada has been engaged from the beginning, making humanitarian assistance a priority and helping those people affected by the typhoon. Even before Typhoon Haiyan hit, Canada allocated $30,000 to the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to help them to prepare for the coming onslaught. Within 24 hours of the storm sweeping across the Philippines, Canada pledged an additional $5 million to support the work of humanitarian partners on the ground, allowing them to begin providing assistance immediately. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475985">One day after that, in response to the unprecedented level of damage and knowing the desire of Canadians to help those in need, the Government of Canada announced the Typhoon Haiyan relief fund. Let me just say that Canadians' generosity has been impressive and immediate. Already, more than $19 million in donations from Canadians has been received by registered Canadian charities. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475986">On November 11, Canada deployed its disaster assistance response team, or DART, which will provide relief such as water and sanitation, as well as emergency health care. This was soon followed by the deployment of the Canadian Red Cross field hospital and a medical team, which is part of Canada's strategic partnership with the organization. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475987">In addition, Canada's support for key United Nations agencies contributed to the early response to the crisis. For example, Canada is the fifth largest donor to the central emergency response fund, which quickly released $25 million to respond to the devastation. To address ongoing needs, Canada committed $15 million in humanitarian assistance on November 18. This means that Canada is the fourth largest donor to this relief effort. This demonstration is well noted among the Filipino community. </ParaText><ParaText id="3475988">I had the opportunity just last Friday to attend a mass at Our Lady of the Assumption Catholic Parish in Toronto, a church that welcomed some 400 or 500 Filipinos and their families to attend mass under the leadership of Archbishop Thomas Cardinal Collins. I can tell the House that it was a most moving and memorable service.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475989">Our government continues to stand with the Filipino Canadians who are desperately waiting for news of their loved ones and especially with those who have had their worst fears confirmed. Our government also announced last week that, effective immediately, we will be prioritizing outstanding visa applications from Filipinos who are significantly and personally affected by the typhoon. I am sure I speak on behalf of all Canadians when I say we stand beside them now in the wake of this devastating typhoon.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3475990"> Canadians are among the most compassionate and generous people in the world, and they are proving it through their overwhelming donations to the Canadian charities that are responding to the impact of Typhoon Haiyan.</ParaText><ParaText id="3475991">I am thankful for the opportunity to bring the hon. members up to date on how Canada is responding to the needs of people affected by Typhoon Haiyan.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
