It fits within a context of tax equity and fairness. It is important to point out that there is a whole history behind this motion. I am presenting it today on behalf of the Bloc Québécois because, given the process we have witnessed by which Ontario was compensated, the Bloc considers that Quebec is losing across the board as far as harmonization of the QST with the GST is concerned. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426098">It is important right at the start to clarify one extremely important element concerning the Quebec nation: as a nation, Quebec possesses the legitimacy required to collect and administer sales tax within its borders. The debate must be based on that principle and that statement of fact. In the course of this day it will be noted—and I will point it out as well—that the present Conservative government's arguments deny that reality.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426099">To give a brief background, the GST was introduced in the early 1990s, and the Government of Quebec harmonized its sales tax with the GST in 1991 and 1992. It was the first in Canada to do so, and it received no compensation. Quebec felt that harmonization of taxes was important for the province's businesses. The Liberal federal government of the day called for the various provinces to follow the Quebec example and harmonize their sales tax.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426100">After several interventions, the Maritimes harmonized their sales taxes in 1997. The Liberal federal government then compensated the maritime provinces which had done so with close to $1 billion, given that there were costs connected to harmonization. Then the province of Quebec asked that Liberal government why it was not offering Quebec the same thing. Since Quebec had already harmonized its sales tax with the GST, why should it not be compensated? </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426101">The Liberal government refused to consider the Quebec government's request for financial compensation. It said that it would provide compensation for the transition to a harmonized tax if the province's revenues declined by more than 5%. In Quebec, revenue losses were less than 5%. Quebec agreed to that because that was the rule, and the province went along with that way of doing things. Quebec always tries to cooperate, so it accepted the situation because it had not lost more than 5% of its sales tax revenue. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426102">However, the Conservative government has changed the rules dramatically. This spring, when the Government of Ontario introduced its budget, it announced plans to harmonize its provincial sales tax with the GST and stated that it would receive $4.3 billion in compensation from the Conservative government. Interestingly, Ontario, like Quebec, will not be losing more than 5% of its sales tax revenue.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1426103">On the contrary, by harmonizing its sales tax, the province will collect more revenue. As I said earlier, this is about tax fairness, and that is the point. It is perfectly clear that the federal government is compensating Ontario, and that smacks of favouritism.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426104">In response, the Government of Quebec passed a unanimous resolution calling on the federal government to pay $2.6 billion in compensation, a pro-rated amount based on Ontario's compensation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426105">Since then, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> has been scrambling to come up with excuses that have absolutely no relation to the logic underlying the Government of Quebec's request. He has been stonewalling by coming up with new reasons for his refusal almost every day.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426106">First, he said that the tax was not really harmonized. In a letter to the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, Quebec's former finance minister, Ms. Jérôme-Forget, said that her government would address the few remaining differences between Ontario's and Quebec's harmonized taxes. It is clear that the Conservative government must compensate Quebec if the two taxes are harmonized and on a level playing field.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426107">Then the government came up with another excuse, and now it is forcing a completely unacceptable situation on Quebeckers.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426108">In 2006, Quebec was said to be a nation, yet it is not recognized as such. In addition, it is being asked to give up the power to collect taxes from its citizens and raise tax revenue from the QST and the GST, something it has been doing since the beginning of this harmonization process. That is totally unacceptable on the part of the Conservative government.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426109">During the 2006 election campaign and the years that followed, we heard the government boast about its open federalism approach. Talk is fine, but we have seen no action since. Unfortunately, what we have here is another example of adding to the pile. Disputes are piling up and, once again, Quebec is the one being denied $2.6 billion. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426110">Great efforts were made during the 2006 election campaign to seduce the electorate. The current <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> went as far as to promise that the provinces' jurisdictions would be respected, that the fiscal imbalance would be dealt with, that the international extension of Quebec's internal jurisdictions would be recognized, that Quebec would have special autonomous status through the recognition of its institutional responsibilities, and that open federalism would put an end to the constant confrontation between Quebec City and Ottawa. That is what the current <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> promised, but clearly these were only words. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426111">Now, two elections later, the great seduction has been replaced with the great disappointment, of which there are many examples. The case at hand today is unfortunately one more example showing that, regardless of the government in office at the federal level, be it Liberal or Conservative, hardly anything has changed in how Canada operates. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426112">There has been a short honeymoon between Quebec and the Conservatives, but I can assure this House that the honeymoon is over and that the confrontation between Quebec City and Ottawa is back on with a vengeance. Moreover, this whole situation is unacceptable to all Quebeckers. We have introduced this motion because we think and we are convinced that Quebec ought to get its fair share and that this is ultimately a matter of fairness and social justice.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Since that time, he keeps inventing new conditions that he knows full well Quebec will never accept. Among other things, the finance minister set a requirement, and he even did it publicly. A letter published in the newspapers said that Quebec would receive compensation only if both the GST and the QST were collected by the federal government from now on. This is totally unacceptable.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426118">There is another aspect to the commitment made by the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>.

In the end, total financial and legal autonomy will be necessary.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426128">I want to read the unanimous motion of Quebec's National Assembly because I believe it sums up the position of Quebec very well:</ParaText>

The Government of Quebec is unanimously saying that they are the ones who have been moving forward on this, acting in good faith, reaching agreements and administering this tax for many years, without ever receiving any compensation, as we watch other provinces receive compensation year after year for various reasons.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426142">Ottawa invents arguments to compensate the other provinces, but it does not compensate Quebec. The federal government's latest invention is very hard to swallow: it is saying that it should collect the money, even though nearly 20 years ago, the federal government said Quebec could collect it. The current government, which has said it is open to Quebec, is more regressive than previous governments in this respect. Quebec truly cannot understand or accept such an attitude.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426143">Quebeckers have always been open-minded. For example, we took positions on free trade that we felt were important for proper trade. But the federal government has always been very jealous of the rights of the National Assembly of Quebec. I believe that there has not been one Government of Quebec in more than 75 years that has not tried to make Quebec more autonomous, and especially more financially independent. As I mentioned earlier, Maurice Duplessis was the first premier to make sure that income tax in Quebec was collected separately from federal income tax.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="30">(1030)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1426144">Later, the government of Mr. Bourassa entered into an agreement whereby Quebec would collect and administer the tax and then send the federal government its share.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426145">So even though there was an internal debate in Quebec and even though the Parti Québécois was ahead of the Liberals on this issue, Quebec realized that this could be an important, worthwhile tax tool. When the federal government lowers its tax and Quebec takes its place, it becomes more financially independent.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426146">It took the Liberals a year or two longer, but they included this measure in the latest budget. They are finally going to recoup the 1%. The Parti Québécois had been calling for this for many years and had suggested it in the past. It is a good measure.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426147">Every time Quebec becomes more financially independent, Quebeckers win, because they are able to assume their responsibilities and invest all the money they need to in their own areas of jurisdiction.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426148">We see all the cuts the federal government is making. For example, it is constantly changing the rules for equalization, forcing Quebec's finance minister to do financial gymnastics, which is unacceptable.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426149">The more financially independent Quebec is, the less dependent it will be on such decisions, and the less it will be in a paternalistic relationship with the federal government. That is the message the Government of Quebec has sent, and it is the message the Bloc Québécois hopes to get across.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426150"> Financial independence has always been an important criterion for developing nations. Let us remember that in the United States, it was the issue of a tax on tea that, in a symbolic way, became the reason why the United States of America decided to become independent from the British Empire.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426151"> In Quebec, opinions are divided concerning independence. We have not yet achieved a solid majority but there certainly is a consensus on the fact that Quebec must have the most financial independence possible. It is that consensus that the Bloc Québécois brings before this House today, and we hope that the House will listen to it. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426152"> It is important, because the response to this motion will have a large impact on the way the people of Quebec view this Parliament. During the next year or so, there will probably be a federal election campaign. When Quebeckers are asked to decide which party will best represent them, they will certainly take a look at who has defended their interests here in this House, in particular the interests formally expressed by the Quebec National Assembly. It is the Bloc Québécois that has done so today. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426153"> Quebec has acted in good faith in this matter. In the past, federal government documents even recognized that taxes were harmonized in Quebec. Now, they have come up with this approach to collecting taxes in an effort to avoid having to compensate Quebec.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426154"> We are not here begging for money. We just want what we are entitled to. As Mr. Duplessis would have said, we want what is ours. This is money that is due to us under this system. It is not true that the rest of Canada has the right to be compensated but not Quebec. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426155"> Rest assured that on this point we represent all Quebeckers. Everyone knows that what we are talking about here is only about half the financial envelope of Canada, and that when decisions are made by the federal government in its areas of jurisdiction, such as national defence, where a great deal of money is being spent on Afghanistan, those decisions mean that money is not available for other types of spending. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426156"> Quebeckers are well aware that the more financially independent they are, the more likely it is that they will be able to develop the social model they desire. They have done that with the parental leave system, with day care centres, and they want to continue to do so. In fact, Quebec has a social model, a society, a nation that is different. Our nation has even been recognized as different by this House. Now, it is time for the Conservative federal government and the federalist parties here to make a gesture toward Quebec. a gesture of fairness, by supporting this motion put forward by the Bloc Québécois. Otherwise, Quebeckers will know what conclusions they should draw. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Because it has realized that Quebec had acquired a significant tool for financial autonomy. The example I just gave, the reduction in the GST that will be recouped by Quebec, that is gradual financial autonomy. Several years from now, we might have less and less income tax, and taxes might be increasingly collected through consumption taxes.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426166"> There is choice in this situation, there is autonomy. Perhaps the federal government has realized this, because at the same time it is losing the hold it has through systems like equalization and other systems where it can set national standards and engage in what it calls Canadian nation-building. In this situation, Quebeckers want their own model and want their nation to have as much autonomy as possible to control its development. Money is the sinews of war. </ParaText>

Lower taxes are part of our Conservative government's ongoing commitment to a smaller tax burden, improving the tax system, and creating an environment where Canadian businesses can flourish to create new jobs today and for tomorrow.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426181">As the Canadian Council of Chief Executives declared:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426182"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The federal government clearly has done everything it can to reduce tax rates within the boundaries of prudent fiscal management. The next major steps in forging a more competitive corporate tax system must come at the provincial level. The single most important measure would be the replacement of remaining provincial sales taxes with value-added taxes, preferably harmonized with the Goods and Services Tax.”</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1426183">While not the most exciting of topics, harmonization is a key economic issue as it has been recognized as tremendously beneficial for job and business growth. As Jonathan Kesselman of the C.D. Howe Institute has stated:</ParaText><ParaText id="1426184"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">--harmonization would reduce Canada's corporate tax burden, make Canadian firms more internationally competitive and make Canada a more attractive place for foreigners to set up shop, injecting job-creating direct investment into the economy.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1426185">The recognized benefits of harmonization include supporting job creation by allowing businesses to save time and money by the move to a simpler more effective tax structure that features: first, a one tax rate, not two; second, one substantially harmonized tax base, not two; and third, one level of tax administration, not two. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426186">Moreover, these efficiencies create cost savings for businesses that will make their way to consumers' wallets. I note that independent academic studies have certainly shown that to be the case when New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador became fully harmonized provinces. </ParaText>

The prices of some things that hadn't been taxed before under the provincial tax went up. Other things stayed the same and some other prices went down. Overall the broad price level in the eastern provinces dropped by roughly the amount of the decline in the net tax rate. So the competitive markets delivered a very quick pass-through of the lower tax on consumer prices.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1426189">Indeed, that is why our government continues to be committed to working with the other provinces to facilitate the transition to a fully modernized, efficient and harmonized tax system in Canada. We also continue to encourage the provinces to reduce their corporate income taxes, so that Canada can reach the goal of an overall 25% federal-provincial corporate income tax rate by the year 2012.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426190">As the Bloc should be aware, Quebec has not fully harmonized its sales tax.

It also administers Quebec's value added tax as well as the GST, an arrangement dating back decades.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426192">Years ago the Quebec government sought to collect the GST for the federal government. The then government agreed and the province of Quebec has been compensated for that since. In fact, last year alone, Quebec was paid approximately $130 million to do just that. What is more, the federal government has paid Quebec about $1.8 billion to date to administer the GST in that province alone. In addition, I understand the federal government does not charge Quebec for the development of GST-specific rulings which it relies on to administer the GST.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426193">In further respect to the situation in Quebec, the Bloc should be well aware that the province decided to introduce its own Quebec style value added tax, or VAT, something quite different from full harmonization. In contrast with New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and now Ontario, Quebec did not have to adopt federal HST legislation. It did not have to sign a comprehensive integrated tax coordination agreement, and has kept full control over the design and administration of its value added tax. Ontario and the three existing fully harmonized provinces have joined that federal framework. Quebec has not. That is the arrangement as it exists currently, and that is the arrangement that the province of Quebec has recently suggested it might wish to alter. </ParaText>

Reducing the tax burden on Canadians will be important in getting through this global recession and positioning our country for future prosperity.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426196">For those in the Bloc, the Liberal Party, and the NDP who would argue for higher job-killing taxes on businesses large and small, I ask them to listen to the words of a recent OECD report that examined what tax structures best promote economic growth. The OECD concluded that corporate taxes are found to be most harmful for growth, and that high corporate taxes may reduce incentives to invest in innovative activities. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426197">Our Conservative government has long been a champion of lower taxes.

We introduced important tax credits, such as the Canada employment credit, the working income tax benefit, and the child tax credit. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426199">We cut taxes in every way that government collects them, personal, consumption, business, excise taxes, and more. Our government removed almost 950,000 low-income Canadians completely from the tax roll. We reduced the overall tax burden by nearly $220 billion, the lowest level in nearly 50 years. We have built on our legacy tax relief by reducing taxes on savings with our landmark tax free savings account.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426200">What does that mean for a typical hard-working Canadian family?

The main reason is that we think it is very important for the government to negotiate in good faith with the Government of Quebec. That is the main point of the motion. There are some differences of opinion between Quebec and the federal government. These differences do not seem too great, though, if we want to have a flexible federation in which we cooperate. We should obviously negotiate with any province, including Quebec, over matters that are good for the federation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426237"> It is as simple as that, and for this reason we will vote in favour of the motion.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="1426238">One thing I will say as a small aside is that it will be interesting to see how the NDP decides to vote on this motion. On the one hand we have NDP members who have ranted and raved against the harmonized tax. On the other hand we have the member for <Affiliation DbId="128308" Type="2">Outremont</Affiliation> who said:</ParaText><ParaText id="1426239"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">How are we supposed to live harmoniously in this country if harmonization gives other provinces billions of dollars while Quebec gets nothing?</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1426240">So it seems that whichever way they decide to vote on this motion there will be NDPers pitted against NDPers, which will be an interesting prospect for non-NDPers to view.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426241">In any case, to return more to the substance of the matter at hand, I think the first point to make is that on economic grounds there is a good case for the GST and a good case for harmonization. It should be noted that every OECD country except the United States has a value-added tax, which is like the GST. A value-added tax is generally thought to be an efficient tax because businesses get credit on the inputs that have already had tax paid on them, so that at the end of the day, all the goods purchased by consumers are taxed only once.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426242">Currently, then, the move by Ontario in the direction of harmonization will result in a reduction in the marginal effect of tax rates, which will be of particular assistance to the manufacturing sector. Therefore, this move is a positive one on two grounds: first, on grounds of efficiency; and second, on grounds of competitiveness. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426243">It is more efficient to have one tax than two taxes. Small businesses and other businesses will then only have one tax to administer rather than two. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426244">This is reminiscent of a move that the Liberal government made, I believe in 2005, to have a single tax collector for corporate income tax in the province of Ontario. This was an agreement between the federal government and Ontario. It was very well received by businesses. It reduced their compliance costs to have only one tax rather than two taxes, and this move in Ontario and potentially in Quebec is of a similar nature. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426245">It is also good for the competiveness of the country because by reducing the effective tax rate on business investment at a time when jobs are disappearing, particularly in Ontario in the manufacturing sector, which is very much in difficulty, this move by the Government of Ontario will be positive for the Ontario economy over the medium term.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426246">If we turn to Quebec, I can count perhaps five areas in which there is incomplete harmonization. First of all, at the moment, Quebec has two taxes rather than one tax. Second, there are some goods on which the provincial tax applies but not the federal tax, but that is the same as will be the case in Ontario. Third, the tax credits, which are part of a GST or value-added tax, are not claimable by larger companies. In the Ontario case, large companies will transition over time to be allowed to claim those tax credits. Fourth, there is a difference in terms of who collects the tax, whether it is the Government of Quebec, as it has been since the time of Brian Mulroney, or whether, as the government wishes to be the case, it is the CRA. The fifth and final point is that, currently, the Quebec sales tax is applied on top of the federal GST.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426247">We are the opposition, not the government. It is the government that should negotiate. I submit that those five differences are not huge. I do not know exactly what the outcome of those differences would be, but certainly they leave scope for the two governments to bargain in good faith. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426248">We in the Liberal Party welcome the Quebec government's indication that is prepared to move to a greater degree of harmonization under certain conditions. We see absolutely no reason the federal government should not enter into negotiations with the Government of Quebec on this subject and in good faith. It is for that reason the Liberal Party will be voting in favour of this motion.</ParaText>

This turmoil in Quebec over the compensation that was handed to the province of Ontario should not come as a surprise.

However, let's not forget that the maritime provinces received more than $1 billion as compensation for their losses in harmonizing sales taxes.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426300"> At the first ministers conference held in Jasper in August 1996, the provincial premiers said that all provinces should get compensation. As he often did, then federal Minister of Finance Paul Martin presented a very skilful calculation based on an objective formula establishing that the maritime provinces were entitled to compensation, but not Quebec. Faced with the same formula in the last few weeks, the other side had to acknowledge that although Ontario was about to receive billions of dollars, it did not meet the conditions that Paul Martin prescribed in his famous formula.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426301"> How can we determine what objective criteria are being used as a basis to deprive Quebec of its share of these billions of dollars? I have to note that when the money was approved for the Maritimes, it was election time on the federal scene, which was, of course, sheer coincidence. It is so good to be able to buy people with their own money.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426302"> We now have a government that has a lot of seats at stake in Ontario. So it is worth finding some money to get Ontario on side. The problem is that Quebec has awakened. The Quebec government is saying, “Wait a minute! Apparently, in 1996-97, we did not meet the criteria established in that famous formula for the Maritimes but are you saying that the formula does not apply anymore because this time it is Ontario?” I would be very happy if Quebec were fairly treated in this case.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426303"> Harmonization is a word that must be used wisely. It does not mean that the feds can do everything on their own terms. I think there is some confusion among Conservatives on this issue and we will see if, on the Liberal side, they finally understand what it is all about.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1426304"> In the quotations that my colleague, the Liberal Party finance critic, gave at the outset, he tried to show a contradiction between what certain people had said, but there is none. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426305"> In Quebec, for example, at present, there is no sales tax on diapers or books. That is a good thing, but it does not mean that if the taxes were harmonized Quebec would have to agree to tax books. If we were to tax ignorance we would have to send the bills over to the Conservatives, and that would be fine, but let us not start taxing knowledge and the ability to gain knowledge. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426306"> Quebec has always decided, since the Quebec sales tax began, that there would be no tax on books. As a result, when this is negotiated, the federal government must not start lecturing Quebec on morality and preaching to it about what the tax should apply to. Harmonizing means harmonizing, it does not mean that one side tells the other what to do. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426307"> There is another subtle factor in Quebec’s case, and that was resolved in the early 1990s under the Bourassa government. A very simple rule was developed. The tax was harmonized—as the federal government said and has spelled out for years, Quebec was the first province to harmonize its tax—but Quebec was responsible for collecting the taxes. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426308"> Once again, I find it hard to see how the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> can justify this kind of administrative upheaval, calling for federal government employees to be responsible for doing this from now on. You do not fiddle with things; you do not fix something that is not broken. The system exists, it is in place, and Quebec collects the taxes. This is not a problem with the harmonization of the GST and the QST. Let us not hear that excuse for not giving Quebec what is owing to it. That would be unacceptable. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426309"> So today the Bloc is taking the bull by the horns with a clearly written, finely crafted motion that explains exactly what it is about. The entire motion is very clear, and I am delighted to see the Liberals joining us, on this rare occasion, in a matter that concerns Quebec, and calling for Quebec to receive the $2.6 billion owing to it. I say it is a pleasure, for once, to see the Liberals supporting a motion that could help Quebec, because we are used to seeing examples of the opposite happening.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426310"> The exception does prove the rule. What is the rule? The Liberals voted against the consensus in Quebec, supported by a unanimous motion of the National Assembly, objecting to the federal government's desire to centralize everything having to do with securities regulation in Canada. The Liberals would have liked to centralize securities here in Ottawa. There is no question of that happening, for us, because the Autorité des marchés financiers is doing its job quite well. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426311"> The Bloc has also put forward a motion that appeals to us: we should see which parts of the protection of the right to work in French can be transferred into the federal legislation in sectors under federal jurisdiction. Is it normal, for example, that an employer can require a knowledge of English just because one of the bosses just arrived from another province and speaks only English and they are in the telecommunications sector, or in a bank, or in inter-provincial transportation? These are all areas under federal jurisdiction. For example, if a person in Rimouski works in a telecommunications company and a new boss arrives from Vancouver and speaks only English, that person in Rimouski has to know English in order to get a promotion. We are going back 50 years. We are going back to the 1950s with this approach. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426312"> Since August 26, 1977, the adoption of the Charter of the French Language has meant that employees and workers in Quebec are entitled to receive all documents from their employer in French. It is rights of this kind that we are looking at here. Twice the Liberals have refused not just to pass bills but merely to study them, once under the previous government and then now. There are surely a lot of things to study here. We do not want to take anyone’s rights away; we want to add rights. The Liberals are voting, therefore, against even studying these bills. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426313"> I find it incomprehensible. If we live in a country with two official languages and one of them is in the minority in Canada as a whole, we have an ethical and moral obligation as a society to do everything we can to strengthen that language in the only province where it is in the majority. We need to ensure that it is a living, appreciated, respected language and that rights attach to its use. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426314"> Simply put, why would a woman who works in a charter bank, which is therefore under federal jurisdiction, have fewer workplace rights—because fewer linguistic rights attach to her job—than a woman who works in a caisse populaire? </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="40">(1140)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1426315"> To ask the question is to answer it for anyone who believes it is important to keep our two languages alive. The Liberals would obviously rather cling to symbols than look at the reality of working people.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426316"> It is different for us in the NDP because we have always understood that linguistic rights are labour rights. That is why we in the NDP are on the same wavelength as many people in Quebec. The Liberals are always out of step with this reality. They know how to talk about recognizing the Quebec nation, but whenever they are asked to do something specific, they are nowhere to be found.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426317"> In regard to the harmonization issue we are discussing today, I think the background just described shows how badly Quebec has been treated by federal governments, both Liberal and Conservative. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426318"> The Bloc motion today distils all this and puts things into proper perspective when it says that the least the government can do is negotiate correctly and in good faith with Quebec. We should be able to assume good faith. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426319">I saw the letter that the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> signed. He was talking about it even yesterday. He signed a letter—evidently one that was hastily written —and quickly had it published in the newspaper <I>La Presse</I>. It was an outright refusal to have an open, objective, appropriate discussion in good faith with Quebec. The good old centralizing Conservatives are dictating conditions to Quebec and remind me of a little old lady wagging her finger. These conditions will not be tolerated, nor will any others.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426320">I find it interesting that, since the outburst by the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> was published in <I>La Presse</I>, his theme song closely resembles the “beep-beep” of a truck backing up. It is becoming increasingly apparent in Parliament that, of the 10 Conservatives elected in Quebec, there will be none left if the Conservatives continue to behave in this manner and allow someone like the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> to make decisions affecting Quebec.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426321">I would also like to add that it is nevertheless an indication that someone in the federal government is doing some thinking and that someone is noticing what is happening, even if he still puts on a brave front when he rises in this Parliament and says that he makes the decisions and no one else, that those are the conditions, that harmonization is harmonization and that that means the federal government will dictate everything. That is the opposite of negotiating in good faith. When you negotiate in good faith, you put everything on the table and indicate what you want to achieve and what is good for the economy, because there is some good for the economy in this approach.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426322">For its part, Quebec believes that there are a certain number of exceptions and that it will not impose more taxes on families or knowledge by taxing books, etc. Everyone can benefit from it. Finally, after more than a decade of effort, Quebec will be given what it is entitled to. Unfortunately, it is only after it was given to Ontario, once again, but better late than never.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We sometimes get beaten by the federal government, and sometimes we are charmed. The Conservatives recognized Quebec as a nation.

If the recognition of the Quebec nation truly is more than just words, it has to be followed by a number of actions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426332">About the nation, I remind hon. members that the government's first action was to reduce the representation of Quebec in the House of Commons.

The NDP has about 40 members from British Columbia to Nova Scotia and has a strong, credible and progressive voice that garnered close to 20% of the votes in the last election. The Liberals mistakenly elected a right-wing leader, thinking that the problem with their last leader was that he was too much of a leftist. That was not the problem. The problem was that they did not represent anything. Considering the leader the Liberals just chose, many Canadians will be looking for a progressive voice for the future, and that voice is the New Democratic Party.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The example of a tax on a tax is the kind of issue that is dealt with through real harmonization and that is easy to compensate on the tax side. That is precisely what should be provided. However, this does not mean that the federal government can impose anything. I gave the example of diapers and books, which are currently not taxed in Quebec. We will never let the federal government lecture us and tell us that, from now on, diapers and books must be taxed. This harmonization is not done to better tax families, because that would be despicable. However, harmonizing in the best interests of the general economy may be a very good thing. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426343">I have always said that Quebec was the first province to harmonize its taxes. In fact, the federal government recognized that this was indeed the case. If the minister wants to find other criteria and excuses to ease his conscience for all those years when Quebec was not compensated, fine.

The fact that a person was a minister in Quebec City does not automatically mean that he or she understands these things. Indeed, some current cabinet ministers are former members of the Quebec National Assembly, but they have already forgotten that.

							<ParaText id="1426371">Why is it that, so far anyway, the Government of Canada, through its finance minister, has denied Quebec's request? It is hard to understand. After Quebec became the first province to harmonize its sales tax with the GST and the Maritimes negotiated for their three provinces up to $1 billion in compensation, the federal government, a Liberal government at the time, told Quebec that the harmonization costs to these provinces exceeded 5% and they would be compensated, but that Quebec's costs were lower than 5%. Quebec agreed with these terms. However, when the Conservative minister approached Ontario, either directly or through someone else, those terms were dropped. They no longer exist. That is how Ontario was offered $4.6 billion to harmonize its sales tax, with the federal government administering the tax collection at no cost to the province. The federal government is not charging them anything for collecting the provincial sales tax.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426372">My problem is not with the minister being generous with Ontario, but rather with him changing the rules. This means that Ontario stands to receive a substantial amount. The same should be true of Quebec. What was the minister's response to Quebec's request? He started by flatly denying it, arguing that the taxes were not perfectly harmonized. The Quebec minister wrote him back, saying that the necessary changes would be made. After running out of reasons for denying Quebec's request, what did the minister say? He said they would see what they could do, but that the tax would have to be collected by the Government of Canada. Nothing could be more unacceptable to Quebec, which has been recognized as a nation by the Conservative government, than being denied the fundamental right to collect its own taxes.</ParaText>

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Paquette" id="2723946"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128108" Type="2">Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1426389">Mr. Speaker, I am extremely pleased to take part in this debate. Once again I feel that the Bloc Québécois and its members are playing their role masterfully in defending without compromise the interests and values of the Quebec nation. I will read today's motion again for the benefit of those who are watching us:</ParaText><ParaText id="1426390"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That, in the opinion of the House, the government should negotiate in good faith with the Government of Quebec to resolve the dispute dating back over ten years regarding the harmonization of the QST with the GST in the early 1990s and agree to provide $2.6 billion in compensation to Quebec for this harmonization, and that Quebec continue to administer these harmonized taxes.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426391">This motion is simply aimed at giving Quebec its due since it was the first province to harmonize its sales tax with the GST. I remember clearly the debates that went on at that time. Harmonizing its sales tax with the GST was not easy for Quebec. When the federal government eliminated the manufacturing sales tax and introduced the goods and services tax, that gave rise to an extremely important debate in Canada and in Quebec. People were wondering about the possible harmful effects of this tax since it is an indirect tax that is applied in the same fashion regardless of income, as is the case with any consumption tax. So there was an extremely important debate and the federal government amended its plan to ensure, through a tax credit, that families would not be penalized by the introduction of the GST, which is a value added tax.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426392">In this context, in the early 1990s, the Government of Quebec, a Liberal government, decided to follow suit. The debate on QST and GST harmonization was not easy in Quebec. In hindsight, I must admit, the premier at the time, Robert Bourassa, showed a great deal of courage by raising and beginning this debate. Harmonizing the QST and the GST was not an easy thing to do.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426393">One might have expected the federal government to strongly emphasize Quebec's leadership in promoting economic efficiency. We agree that two sales taxes of this kind should be harmonized as much as possible. Clearly, as we can imagine, certain choices involve greater flexibility. For instance, in Quebec, there is no sales tax on books and on culture, although the federal government continues to tax culture and books with the GST. In that case, one would have expected the federal government to harmonize its tax with the Quebec tax.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426394">Therefore we might have expected the federal government not only to harmonize its tax with Quebec when it comes to GST on books, but also to emphasize Quebec's leadership in terms of economic efficiency. Clearly, it will be much simpler when Quebec becomes a sovereign country. Then there will be only one sales tax, which we will administer based on our values and our preferences. In the meantime, we must try to make the most of the situation. It is unfortunate that members from Quebec who belong to the other parties of this House are not defending the interests and values of Quebeckers. However, I am not worried. In the next election, which will be held soon, the people of Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean will solve the problem of the Conservative members who are totally ineffective when it comes to defending Quebec's interests. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426395">I will get back to the QST and GST, which were harmonized in 1990. When three of the Atlantic provinces decided to harmonize their own sales taxes with the GST, the federal government offered compensation of approximately $1 billion. Up to that point, there had been no compensation for provinces that harmonized their taxes. When the federal government decided to compensate the Atlantic provinces for harmonizing their tax with the GST, it would have been quite normal for the government at that time, which was Liberal, and finance minister Paul Martin, to compensate Quebec.</ParaText>

That pretext was the collection by the federal government of the harmonized sales tax, whether GST or QST. That is totally unacceptable for Quebec. </ParaText>

It is members from Quebec who are opposed to positions adopted unanimously by the Quebec National Assembly regarding the harmonization of the Quebec sales tax with the GST. That motion was adopted by the National Assembly but, once again, the elected Conservative members from Quebec are rising to oppose Quebec's will. It is shameful. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426478">They did the same thing with the manufacturing and forestry sectors. They keep going in the same direction. Fortunately, Quebeckers are not stupid. They are educated, they follow politics, and they know who is protecting their interests and who is not. Today, we can see—once again—that the Conservative Party across the floor is going against Quebeckers' interests. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426479">With this motion, we are simply asking the federal government to act fairly towards Quebec, by compensating it for having harmonized its sales tax with the GST, in the same way that Ontario was given $4.3 billion and that the maritime provinces were compensated before that. It is quite simple. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426480">The government is telling us once again, in this House, that it does not understand Quebeckers' position and that this claim is not justified. Come on. Quebeckers can do the math. They know when they are treated unfairly, as was the case with the last Conservative budget. Ontario is getting $2.7 billion, while the rest of Canada—whose forestry and manufacturing sectors account for many more jobs—is getting a measly $150 million. We are not stupid. As regards this motion specifically, I want to thank the Liberal Party and the New Democratic Party for their support. I also want to point out to Conservative members that the federal government's refusal goes against a clear and unanimous position of the Quebec National Assembly. I invite Conservative members to reflect on that. They are voting against Quebec's will.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426481">Indeed, on March 31, the Quebec National Assembly unanimously passed a motion asking the federal government to treat Quebec fairly and justly by providing it with $2.6 billion in compensation, for having harmonized its sales tax with the GST.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426482">Could it be that the National Assembly does not understand these issues? Could it be that Conservative members from Quebec are the only ones who understand major issues? Is this what we are being told?

							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1426485">In the early 1990s, Quebec was the first province to harmonize its tax with the federal tax, and it still has not gotten a single cent. But that is not all. Not only will Ontario get roughly $4.3 billion in compensation, but the maritime provinces received nearly $1 billion in 1997 for harmonizing their sales tax.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426486">Quebec, which had already harmonized its tax, got nothing. The whole dispute between the Government of Quebec and the federal government about harmonizing the QST with the GST shows that the Liberal and Conservative governments have acted in bad faith on this issue. The Liberals, who were in power previously, also did nothing.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426487">I believe it is important to remember certain facts. This will be edifying for the Conservative members from Quebec. In July 1992, Quebec finished harmonizing its sales tax with the federal tax, but never received any compensation. In addition to harmonizing its tax, Quebec negotiated an arrangement with Ottawa whereby Quebec administered the GST in the province and turned over the revenues to the federal government.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426488">In return for this service, the Government of Quebec received financial compensation. As I said earlier, in 1997 the provinces of Newfoundland, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia reached an agreement with Ottawa to receive $1 billion in compensation over four years to harmonize their sales tax.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426489">At the time, the Liberal federal government, which was criticized by the Conservatives, argued that Quebec, like Ontario and British Columbia, would not be entitled to compensation because the transition to this new system would not cause Quebec's sales tax revenues to drop by more than 5%.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426490">Now—and this is in direct contradiction to the rule the Liberals made to compensate the maritime provinces—we learn that the Ontario government will get more money with the new tax than with the old formula.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426491">The government is doing everything it can for Ontario. Members from Quebec should stand up and vote in favour of the motion.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426492">Clearly, when the federal government is agreeing to pay Ontario $4.3 billion in compensation for harmonizing its sales tax with the federal tax, then Quebec, which was the first province to harmonize its sales tax with the GST in 1991, has every right to ask for fair compensation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426493">How can the Conservative members from Quebec vote against this measure? I do not understand whom these members are defending. So far, the Conservative government is refusing to listen and is making excuses. It is stalling so that it does not have to say yes to legitimate requests from Quebec and its National Assembly.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426494">It is especially disappointing to see ministers and members from Quebec oppose Quebec's request. Despite Quebec's repeated requests, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> has come up with even more conditions. First came the seduction, when they supposedly recognized the Quebec nation; now it is time for the let-down.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426495">Not only does the Minister of Finance want a single tax to be collected, but now he is asking Quebec to turn over management of the GST and the QST to the federal government. What a great way to recognize a nation's legitimacy. Well done, Conservative members.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426496">But Quebeckers will not fall for it. They understand what is going on. Nobody in Quebec wants the Government of Quebec to turn over responsibility for the tax to the federal government. We are a nation, and we can take care of our own taxes. We should have sovereignty over all of our taxes.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426497">As a nation, Quebec has the right to collect and administer sales taxes within the province. Instead of spending 85% of the Canadian Heritage money currently earmarked for Quebec on funding federalist propaganda activities and Canada Day celebrations, and instead of implementing policies that penalize Quebeckers, the Conservatives should compensate Quebec for having harmonized its tax and help our forestry and manufacturing industries and our unemployed workers. </ParaText>

I have had an opportunity to listen to the debate and representations from all the parties. We have covered a lot of ground. We have had some interesting discussions about ideology and a range of matters that probably stretch way beyond the specifics of the motion.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426546">While I understand that having latitude in debate is a good thing, I was looking at Marleau and Montpetit to see that the issue of relevance was basically framed in the context that there is very little time in the House to waste. We have important work to do and it is important that all hon. members try to stay focused on the matter before us, which includes debate on amendments. Even if there is an amendment, the subsequent debate should be on the specifics of the amendment rather than the whole motion. It is an important principle and I hope that members will take an opportunity to consult our Standing Orders and Marleau and Montpetit about how to get down to the issues before the House.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426547">It is extremely important for members to have an opportunity to hear the substantive reasons for and against a certain motion before the House simply because very few members get an opportunity to speak to this or ask a question. Members are at committees or busy at meetings. This morning I met with the Canadian Real Estate Association and with the International Association of Fire Fighters for a few minutes each on issues important to them, but I wanted to follow the debate. I was really surprised at some of the arguments. I think that creative people could argue this one almost either way with a straight face and conviction.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426548">First I will remind members of the motion to which we are speaking. It is a Bloc Québécois opposition day motion that reads:</ParaText><ParaText id="1426549"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That, in the opinion of the House, the government should negotiate in good faith with the Government of Quebec to resolve the dispute dating back over ten years regarding the harmonization of the QST with the GST in the early 1990s and agree to provide $2.6 billion in compensation to Quebec for this harmonization, and that Quebec continue to administer these harmonized taxes. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426550">One really must look at the motion to understand that there are several elements at play here. The first element is the reference to good faith. I do not think anybody would disagree that fairness and good faith are mandatory elements if the federal government and the provinces are to make important agreements between them. If there should be any indication whatsoever that there is not good faith, the results can probably be predicted.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426551">I must admit that I was a little concerned that the Conservative <Affiliation DbId="125159" Type="4">Minister of Public Works and Government Services</Affiliation> seemed to spend a little bit of time attacking the other parties rather than addressing the issue. I know the minister is on the record saying that the government will not support this motion. It will not support the motion because it does not believe that the elements of the harmonization have been met by Quebec. Things will need to change or there is no compensation. We can know from the government that it is pretty black and white.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426552">Having said that, I think it is fair to say that the other two opposition parties will be supporting the motion before the House right now for a fairly simple reason. It is an important objective to achieving the benefits of harmonization of a sales tax. It is in the best interests of businesses, of consumers and of the provinces because it provides administrative simplicity as well as the opportunity to have a more efficient situation with regard to the cost of doing business in Quebec or in any other province. A harmonized base in a tax credit system makes things a little cheaper for the consumer, notwithstanding that there may be a few other items added in when one harmonizes the basis on which a harmonized tax is applied.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1426553">There are some disputed items here that go back over 10 years. Quebec was one of the first provinces to come into a quasi-harmonization agreement back in the 1990s. However, because this was back in the 1990s, members will probably need to look back at a little bit of the history. If I have some time, I might even refer to some of the history.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426554">The other item is to provide this $2.6 billion of compensation. Members will probably need to be assured that they understand the terms and conditions under which compensation is payable, whether those terms and conditions have been met and, if not, whether they are substantive enough that discussions on compensation cannot still move forward to some extent and maybe even fully if the items were considered not to be material in terms of achieving the objectives of harmonizing the tax.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426555">Finally, the motion deals with who collects the tax. The motion calls for the Province of Quebec to continue to administer the harmonized taxes. There is precedence in Quebec now for the collection of tax. Quebec collects its own income taxes, whereas for the Province of Ontario and, I think, all the other provinces, the federal government does collect both the provincial and the federal taxes. Therefore, there is some precedence with regard to the collection. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426556">However, who collects the taxes, I would argue, really does not matter as long as the appropriate amount of taxes are collected and the amounts are distributed to the jurisdictions to which they belong in an efficient fashion. I do not see that as a major item.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426557"> I read over the motion because what is in the motion defines the boundaries of our discussion. To deal with ideology at this point probably is not as respectful to the House as maybe we should be.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426558">As I indicated, the Liberals will be supporting the motion. There are, however, some points to be made that I need to put into context.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426559">Sales tax harmonization, conceptually, is something that we support. There is very good evidence for a harmonized tax. Obviously there are efficiencies having one system versus two. By having a common tax base, it means that people who are responsible for these things do not need to determine how much to tax this one and that one. There are so many interesting examples of the exceptions to the rule that it makes it very complicated and businesses do not have a lot of time to administer their business. They should be encouraged to do things that are promoting the growth of their business, to improve sales, to be profitable and to create jobs. Those are the things we want to encourage.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426560">Although the issue that has been brought before the House today is worthy of moving forward, there is no question in my mind that we need to deal with the current situation in Canada, the economic crisis, by ensuring the economic stimulus that Parliament approved in the last budget gets out in a timely manner. The implications of failing to do that in terms of a stimulative strategy to the economy would be very tragic for the country in terms of the depth of the recession, the accumulation of debt and the depth of a deficit and the loss of jobs. I think of the young people who are leaving the education phase of their lives and going out to find jobs only to find that they are now competing for entry level jobs with people who have five to ten years' experience. It is a real problem which is why we need to be successful on the stimulative side.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426561">Although this matter is important, it is too bad it has to come before Parliament and take up Parliament's time. It should happen automatically. A dialogue should be opened up between the Province of Quebec and the Government of Canada to resolve the issues that are outstanding and to discuss the $2.6 billion compensation.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1426562">I was looking back at some of the recent statements by the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> to try to understand a little more about why we had not had a resolution of this.

It sounds to me, to the extent that there are differences in the deal the Ontario and the Atlantic provinces have in terms of harmonizing the taxes, that the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> has closed the door and said that there will be no discussions, that these are the rules of the game and that is the way it will be.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426565">That is pretty clear, and the Conservatives have indicated they will oppose the motion.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426566">On the same day, the <Affiliation DbId="125159" Type="4">Minister of Public Works</Affiliation> said in the House:</ParaText><ParaText id="1426567"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> Mr. Speaker, at a given point, unlike Ontario, Quebec did not pass the federal harmonized sales tax legislation.

When I saw the motion come before us, I was not sure whether this was a serious attempt to maybe make a resolution here.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426570">The finance critic for the Liberal Party addressed the House earlier. He gave some very encouraging words about not why this should not happen, but why it should. I subscribe to the philosophy of “Please don't tell me why I can't; tell me how I can”, taking into account some of the historic and precedent conditions that already exist between the Government of Canada and the province of Quebec.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426571">The <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> appears to have changed his tune a bit, and that was very encouraging. On April 21, in the House, he said:</ParaText><ParaText id="1426572">

Therefore, we have already achieved something in terms of raising the issue and pointing out that there are some arguments.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426576">As I indicated, the current economic challenge that we face is our priority, but this is a point that can be dealt with and should be dealt with, as the lead speaker said, equity and tax justice. That is what we are talking about.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426577">The second point I want to make is we are pleased that the Government of Quebec has indicated it will consider eliminating the remaining obstacles to full harmonization, including not levying the QST on top of the GST.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426578">This matter has been evolving. There have been some discussions. It appears there is some openness on behalf of the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, which I think is encouraging, and there has been some openness to resolve those obstacles with regard to the province of Quebec. This tells me there is an opportunity here for discussions, consultations and resolution of the outstanding items.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1426579">Members might want to muse about the obstacles and where they stand. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426580">The whole situation of harmonization has to do with putting two taxes into one. Today we still have two taxes, the Quebec sales tax and the GST. Literally there is no harmonization.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426581">One Bloc member indicated that Canada could have two taxes and still achieve harmonization. An argument could be made that having two taxes would not really be a major difference as long as the reconciliation items between the two taxes would not be onerous or maybe mitigate the benefits that could flow from harmonizing the taxes.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426582">The second item has to do with applying the difference on the basis of which taxes are applied. This could cause some problems. It could cause businesses some grief. I have a feeling that some reconciliation could happen. The province of Ontario has made some exemptions to accommodate the difference between the GST and the PST. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426583">The tax credit is an interesting aspect to the extent that there is a GST tax credit. Tax credits available through the Quebec government do not merit. There are some benefits that would accrue not only to businesses, because of the flow-through nature of the GST tax credit, but to consumers as well.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426584">The next item deals with who would collect the tax. I argued earlier that whether it is the Government of Quebec or the Government of Canada that collects the harmonized tax should not matter all that much. It is not a fatal flaw in the harmonization scheme as long as the mechanism provides that the moneys owing on the taxes are properly remitted to a jurisdiction and that the distribution or division of those funds is in accordance with the agreement.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426585">Finally, is the issue of a tax on a tax, where the QST is applied against GST paid goods. We can deal with this problem. Depending on the compensation, and I do not know the full details of the mechanics or the scope or the latitude, that is also resolvable.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426586">If these are the items to be reconciled, then I do not see them as major. These are relatively minor points that could be resolved through discussions between the province of Quebec and the Government of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426587"> I am encouraged by the shifting in position of the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> on this matter. The finance minister made some assertions that harmonization was a very good economic policy and that it represented a massive tax cut that would promote job creation and investment in the province of Ontario. It should also do the same for the province of Quebec.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426588">The motion is worthy of discussion. I am sorry the Conservatives have decided not to support it. When there are disagreements in interprovincial relations, we have the tools and the will to discuss those disagreements and resolve them. I consider this matter to be somewhat of a test case. Where is the good faith? Where is the equity? Where is the tax justice?</ParaText><ParaText id="1426589">I want to reiterate that the Liberal Party is concerned about the challenges we face with respect to dealing with the economic crisis. We want to eliminate those obstacles. We will support the motion.

I will take the time to read it so that all of the men and women listening understand:</ParaText><ParaText id="1426614"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That, in the opinion of the House, the government should negotiate in good faith with the Government of Quebec to resolve the dispute dating back over ten years regarding the harmonization of the QST with the GST in the early 1990s and agree to provide $2.6 billion in compensation to Quebec for this harmonization, and that Quebec continue to administer these harmonized taxes. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426615">I think that the motion is clear. Since the early 1990s, the Government of Quebec has been collecting the GST on behalf of the federal government. Since the early 1990s, Quebec has said that the sales taxes are harmonized. The federal government has never entered into discussions or negotiations regarding a harmonized sales tax. Since Quebec took charge of the GST for the federal government, other provinces, including the Atlantic provinces, have received compensation for harmonizing their sales taxes. Recently, Ontario received over $4 billion for harmonizing its tax.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426616">Given that, it should come as no surprise that Quebec's National Assembly passed the motion I am about to read. It appears in the National Assembly's <I>Journal des Débats</I> for March 31, 2009. It was passed unanimously by all parties in the National Assembly, including the Parti Québécois, the Liberal Party and the Action démocratique du Québec. I will read it now:</ParaText>

							<ParaText id="1426624">The Bloc Québécois did not pick the amount of $2.6 billion out of a hat. That was the amount requested in the motion passed unanimously by Quebec's National Assembly. Every party in this House, Liberal, NDP and Conservative, if they wanted to, could have read this unanimous motion from Quebec's National Assembly. That is why I am somewhat baffled to hear Conservative members ask, “Do we have $2.6 billion? That was not part of our budget plan.”</ParaText><ParaText id="1426625">Ontario decided to harmonize its tax in 2010, and instantly, the Conservatives went running to negotiate with Ontario so they could set these funds aside. Yet I see no one running to negotiate this future agreement with Quebec. It is the same thing with the other parties. The NDP as well as the Liberal Party could have quickly contacted members of Quebec's National Assembly and the leaders of each provincial party to tell them they were willing to stand up for this.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1426626">The only party that has stood up day after day in the House of Commons is the Bloc Québécois and its leader. We have asked questions practically every day since the National Assembly of Quebec made its decision. Why? Because we represent and defend the interests of Quebeckers.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426627">Yes, we are glad that the Liberals and the NDP have decided to support our motion today, but those parties never would have introduced such a motion in the House of Commons. That is a fact. They are supporting the motion because, once again, the Bloc Québécois stood up for Quebec's interests and introduced this motion calling on the government to finally compensate Quebec. For political reasons, the Liberals and the NDP have no choice but to follow suit. When we introduced the motion, we knew these parties had to support us. That is a fact.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426628">Once again, for the Quebeckers who are watching, it is always a battle. It is a battle every time. When we defend a unanimous motion of the National Assembly of Quebec, we are not being partisan because we are supporting our sister party, the Parti Québécois. We are defending the interests of Quebeckers. All the members from Quebec in this House should have stood up, as the leader of the Bloc Québécois and my fellow Bloc members have done since the National Assembly motion was adopted, to make the government understand that we must adopt this motion. Quebec must get $2.6 billion in compensation, because it was the first province that decided to harmonize the tax.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426629">The reason why the federal government is not compensating Quebec is that the Conservatives decided that, in keeping with their position and the proposal they had made to Quebec, the tax would have to be collected by Ottawa. All the parties in Quebec feel strongly about this. Even the federalist parties in Quebec do not want Ottawa to collect the QST. Quebec has collected this tax since 1992 and will keep on collecting it. That is a fact. This is a shared jurisdiction, and Quebec decided to take on this responsibility.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426630">Although the Conservatives have gone to great lengths to reach out to Quebec, they have also appropriated powers from Quebec and transferred them to Ottawa at every opportunity. That is the position the Conservatives are defending today. It is rather disappointing that the Conservative members from Quebec do not support the unanimous motion of the National Assembly. It is disappointing. For those of us who strategically decided to ask questions day after day and to present this motion today on an opposition day, we are very aware that both the NDP and the Liberal Party had to support this motion for purely political reasons. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426631">Once again, we thank them. They have woken up. It is always too late when it comes to Quebec but, fortunately, the Bloc Québécois is here to enlighten them and wake them up when it comes to Quebec. It is with pride that we hope that tomorrow's vote will result in the motion being adopted by a majority. The position defended by the Conservatives leads us to believe that they will vote against the motion once again, because of money according to what we are told.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426632">Earlier I was listening to my Conservative colleague who asked where they were going to find the $2.6 billion. Where did they find the $4.3 billion to compensate Ontario? The compensation will come from the same envelope. It is not true that they had planned to provide compensation. It was Ontario who decided to harmonize its tax. The Premier of Ontario announced it in his budget and he negotiated with Ottawa. The federal government ran to negotiate with the Premier of Ontario and to give him what he wanted.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426633">All we are asking is that, when this motion is adopted by a majority in the House of Commons tomorrow, the Conservative Party proceeds with haste to negotiate with Quebec, that it announces the good news and that it finds the $2.6 million to give to Quebec. We are in an economic downturn. This crisis has affected Quebec as severely as Ontario and, once again, Quebeckers deserve as much attention as the citizens of Ontario and of the Maritimes, who were fully compensated for this harmonization.</ParaText>

Parliament adopted a process that seemed to be fair to deal with equalization. Those who kept an eye on this issue know that.

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Gagnon" id="2725037"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128117" Type="2">Ms. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1426640">Mr. Speaker, an important motion is being debated today in this House. I would like to remind the House of the main features of this motion.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426641">The Bloc Québécois is asking the Conservative Party to negotiate in good faith with the Government of Quebec. There has been a dispute for the past 10 years with the National Assembly of Quebec about the harmonization of the GST and the QST.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426642">Clearly the Conservative Party did not take the initiative on this motion. The Conservatives did not admit to Quebec that they had made promises during the last campaign. They did not apologize and say that they would like to stop fighting over this issue and, once and for all, give Quebec what it is asking for, so that the GST and the QST can be harmonized with respect for the jurisdictions of Quebec.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426643">Quebec wants the federal government to provide it with $2.6 billion in compensation and it wants to continue administering the two taxes. The recognition of the Quebec nation should not be invoked against this motion. If we recognize the Quebec nation, it should go without saying that we recognize also that Quebec has its own way of doing things and its own jurisdictions. Why then can we not legitimize the collection and the administration of the two taxes by Quebec?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426644">As we know, in 1997, when a Liberal government was in office, it harmonized the GST with the sales taxes of the maritime provinces, and it provided $1 billion in compensation for the losses generated by the harmonization of the two taxes. However, the Liberal government had also specified that the compensation was to be calculated when revenue losses would exceed 5%.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426645">Then, the Conservative government got elected, and what did it do? It ignored that rule. It threw away the 5% rule and said that it no longer applied. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426646">Such is the Conservative Party: it sings two different tunes, as a fellow Bloc member said. It would have us believe that it is flexible, that it is open towards Quebec, but it is just the opposite. So, that criterion was no longer taken into consideration by the Conservatives after they took office. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426647">In fact, this is what led the Conservatives to provide a $4.3 billion compensation to Ontario, so that the province would harmonize its sales tax. So, we are talking about a double standard here.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426648">The Quebec National Assembly introduced a motion dealing specifically with this request from the Quebec government, asking for a $2.6 billion compensation. Perhaps I should explain what this loss of revenues means.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426649">The harmonization of the sales tax in 1990 was the result of an agreement between Ottawa and the Quebec government. Under that agreement, Quebec would collect not only its QST, but also the GST for the federal government. So, this is a tax on a tax. It is called a value-added tax, and it is a tax on the price of a product. In other words, a tax is collected on the product that is bought, and the GST is based on this added value to the product that is bought. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426650">So, we are talking about a loss of $6 million in value added taxes, which is the tax on the tax, and of $500 million in QST, which medium and large businesses must pay on certain products called inputs, such as vehicles and gas. That tax is not refunded to them. That is why Quebec wants a $2.6 billion compensation. It has calculated that this loss of revenues is hurting its fiscal capacity, particularly since the province must deal with many other issues and must assume numerous responsibilities. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426651">Our motion today has the support of the Quebec National Assembly.</ParaText>

In fact, in response to questions from the Bloc on harmonization with the GST, the minister and member from the south shore indicated that the Government of Quebec wanted to reach agreement with the Conservative government. Would that mean that the Government of Quebec would just give up? Yet there was a motion adopted by the National Assembly. Would Quebec give up its demand for the $2.6 billion and the right to collect and administer the two taxes?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426931">The Quebec National Assembly called—in a motion from all members—for the Conservative government to recognize Quebec's jurisdiction over taxation. I doubt that the Conservative Party would consent to that. Promises were made to us, but this would not be the first broken promise by one government after another. The Liberals too had made promises to us, promises that were broken once they were elected. Now it is the Conservatives' turn. Just think of Mr. Trudeau and his statement in 1980 that Quebec would stand to gain: what we got was the patriation of the Constitution. In 1984, Mr. Mulroney promised Quebec that he would bring it back into the constitutional fold with honour and enthusiasm; we came up against a wall and what Quebeckers got was a watered down Meech Lake accord.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426932">Then the Liberals came back to power with other promises. Jean Chrétien promised lots of changes: what we got was the Clarity Act and the muzzling of Quebec as far as determination of its desire for sovereignty was concerned. They wanted to determine the question in Quebec's stead, Then the Liberals tried to buy us with the sponsorship scandal. Now we can see how the Conservatives are approaching the celebration of Canada in Quebec. Pretty much the same way the Liberals did. The Conservatives have no qualms about giving away the taxpayers' dollars. They are giving Quebec 85% of the total envelope earmarked for Canada Day. On the other hand, when they are asked to give Quebec its fair share, whether in connection with equalization or for Quebec's forest companies, the Conservatives do not have the same propensity to understand the realities of Quebec. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426933"> The Conservatives promised us great, open federalism, but we see clearly that this ship has sprung a leak. They said they would put an end to disputes between the federal and provincial governments. Yet, during the last election campaign, we saw that all those disputes continued. They have disregarded the various motions we present here in this Parliament, motions adopted by the Quebec National Assembly. Yet, it can be said that the members of the Quebec National Assembly are not all sovereignists.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426934"> Once again, we see clearly that almost the same thing always happens with a federalist party. When it comes time to recognize Quebec’s determination to collects its own taxes, the federal government, all federalist parties included, have about the same attitude, because to do otherwise would upset the rest of Canada. We can understand their logic. They are far from willing to recognize Quebec's different responsibilities in constitutional matters. They are very far from willing. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426935"> We would have wished that the Conservative government would change its mind today and recognize that, as part of the harmonization of the GST in the Atlantic provinces and Ontario, there was compensation of $1 billion for each of the three Atlantic provinces, and a bit more than $4 billion for Ontario. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="15">(1515)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1426936"> We know that they gave compensation to Ontario, which is, after all, a double standard. Why Ontario but not Quebec? They say that Quebec can no longer collect its own tax and the federal tax. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426937"> Today, they dared to answer a question from the Bloc Québécois by saying that Quebec has been compensated because it receives $1 billion a year for administering what the federal government gives free of charge to the other provinces. Officials are on the job to do what the federal government was supposed to do; however, it had been agreed that in Quebec, it was the Government of Quebec that would be responsible for administration.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426938"> Now, we are hearing a different tune. The Conservatives have changed their position. Compensation was based on a collection system that included losses. If those losses exceeded 5%, compensation was provided. However, when the Conservatives came to power, they disregarded that and took a new approach, which gives them the right to negotiate with the other provinces as if they wished to be harmonized; but not Quebec.

Nothing less will do, to ensure that there is full and balanced debate on this issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426948"> There is a huge range of programs that illustrate our government’s commitment, in particular when it comes to levelling the playing field throughout Canada through the equalization program.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426949"> Those payments mean that all provinces are able to provide a reasonably comparable level of service at reasonably comparable levels of taxation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426950"> Equalization is designed to help the less well-off provinces and it must be fairly dynamic in order to adapt to changing economic circumstances.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426951"> Our government not only places great priority on preserving and strengthening programs, it also focuses on the future. Ensuring that the equalization program is sustainable is crucial to Canadians as well as to our government.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426952"> Equalization payments have risen by 56% since 2003-2004. The government has taken steps to ensure that equalization payments will rise at a viable pace.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426953"> Last fall, the unprecedented volatility in international financial markets and natural resource prices called for us to take firm and decisive action. The government responded quickly to mitigate the impact of the global credit crisis on Canadian financial institutions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426954"> As well, the equalization program has to adapt to new developments that no one could have foreseen, in particular the extreme volatility of natural resource prices, which has put intolerable pressure on the program.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426955"> For example, at the meeting of finance ministers held on November 3, 2008, the provinces were informed of upcoming changes to the equalization program, and we told them in advance what the amounts would be for payments to be made in 2009-2010, to facilitate their budget planning.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426956"> At the November meetings, the government announced that because Ontario had become an equalization-recipient province, the baseline fiscal capacity for the new equalization program would correspond to the average fiscal capacity of the recipient provinces.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426957"> That was the explanation for the projected increase, based on a three-year moving average, along with the new ceiling, which was based on the average fiscal capacity after equalization of the provinces that receive payments under the program.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426958"> The detailed calculations, including the impact on each of the provinces, were presented on November 13.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426959"> On November 21, the provinces were made aware of the proposed legislative approach to be incorporated in the bill to give effect to the changes. The changes were again explained and justified in the economic and fiscal statement presented by the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> on November 27, 2008.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426960"> In addition, the provinces were informed of the projected impact of the changes over five years at the December meeting of finance ministers.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426961"> The equalization changes that were discussed in November were confirmed in the 2009 budget that was introduced in January.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426962"> At that time, the government reaffirmed the commitment it had made, in the context of restoring fiscal balance, to offering growing, long-term transfers to the provinces and territories.</ParaText>

Viable growth in the equalization program is now assured, in line with the economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426964"> I would like to quickly highlight a few of the most significant measures our government has adopted in this important area. The 2007 budget, which was supported by the party of our colleague who has presented this motion today, provided for the renewal and strengthening of equalization by including a principle-based approach and long-term fair, growing funding. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426965"> We made adjustments to the equalization program consistent with the O’Brien recommendations and within the principle-based structure set out in the 2007 budget, which provide for long-term funding growth. Specifically, equalization will grow in line with the economy. The growth provision will also act as a floor to protect provinces against reductions in overall equalization. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426966"> The growth path will reflect a three-year moving average of nominal gross domestic product growth, which will help to ensure stability and predictability for both orders of government while still being responsive to changes in economic conditions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426967"> The government periodically consults all the territories and provinces, and we adopt measures to maintain sustainable, fair growth in the equalization program. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426968"> I would now like to take a few minutes to show how our government has succeeded in meeting its two key commitments, starting with the commitment to fairness. Until 2008-2009, the fiscal capacity of the lowest non-receiving province was used as the measure to ensure fairness and provide stability. However, if the number of receiving provinces expands to cover roughly two-thirds of the Canadian economy, a new measure is required to both ensure fairness and that provinces continue to receive a meaningful and stable net fiscal benefit from resources.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426969"> The new ceiling has been set to reflect the average post-equalization fiscal capacity of those provinces receiving equalization. The result is that receiving provinces will get a net fiscal benefit from their resources equivalent to half the per capita resource revenues of the receiving provinces. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426970"> In keeping with the fiscal balance approach, the government is providing transition payments for 2009-2010, to ensure that a province that receives equalization in that year will receive no less than its payments for 2008-2009. Overall, equalization will continue to be fair as a result of these changes. </ParaText><ParaText id="1426971"> Mr. Speaker—</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

This is a matter of equity and give and take.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426989"> If Quebec wants to take the same path, it can expect to be treated in the same way. The Government of Canada will be happy to discuss the possibility of Quebec joining the harmonized federal sales tax system. As for the other harmonized provinces, that will mean the following. The provincial share of the harmonized sales tax is levied under the federal legislation. The tax base is essentially the same as for the federal GST. In addition, the federal and provincial components of the harmonized sales tax are administered by the Canada Revenue Agency. The provincial revenues are paid out in accordance with the framework for the distribution of harmonized sales tax revenues following the signature of a comprehensive integrated tax coordination agreement.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1426990"> Under the terms of this agreement, companies that collect the harmonized sales tax deal with only one tax authority, regardless of where their offices are located. This obviates overlap and bureaucratic inefficiencies. It also has the effect of lowering costs for both the government authorities and taxpayers and, by the same token, makes us more attractive to investors, which is good for Quebec and good for Canada as a whole.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426991"> Our government has made a firm commitment to the provinces to ensure that the stability and predictability of the program is adapted to economic growth. Like all the provinces in our great country, Quebec will be able to continue counting on long-term, targeted assistance from our government based on a cooperative approach.</ParaText><ParaText id="1426992"> In conclusion, I would like to propose an amendment, namely that the motion be changed by striking out all the words after “in the early 1990s”.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It seems the Conservatives have forgotten it, even though the letter is fairly recent. I think we will hear this often during debate this afternoon.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427074">We have heard some very peculiar things. The parliamentary secretary said that he wanted to deal with legitimately elected people. It just so happens that we too are legitimately elected, even if it is not up to us, but to the provincial government, to negotiate in this case. The Bloc Québécois cannot solve this problem, but if it were not for us, the matter would probably never have been raised in this place. It is thanks to the Bloc Québécois members, and not the Conservative members from Quebec, that this debate is being held today. I wanted to underscore this because I think it is very important.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427075">As my colleague said earlier, does open federalism mean refusing to give Quebec what it is entitled to? Every time an issue has to do with Quebec, we come up against a brick wall with the Conservative government, and every time, we raise the issue again. We have to fight, insist and repeat that all we want is justice within this Canadian confederation. As my colleague said, we must not forget that our taxes are paying for this compensation. Quebec is paying a little more than $1 billion of the $4.3 billion in compensation for Ontario. That money is coming from all over. If we are paying some of it, then we would like to have the right to the same treatment as the other provinces, like Ontario.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427076">Currently, there is no major obstacle to compensating Quebec. There is no more obstacle to compensating Quebec than there was to compensating Ontario. The government wasted no time in giving Ontario $4.3 billion. Now, it is trying to tell us that there are major obstacles, because we are trying to gain political advantage. That is only reason the government is refusing to treat Quebec in the same way as Ontario.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427077">Certainly, Ontario had further to go in harmonizing its taxes. Quebec can do so easily by making the few adjustments that have been requested.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427078">But what does harmonizing taxes mean?</ParaText><ParaText id="1427079">Harmonizing provincial sales tax means adopting the same taxation mechanism as the GST. We all agree on that. In other words, a harmonized tax system is a system where the federal and provincial components of the tax apply in the same way to the same goods. Quebec already does that. Harmonizing Ontario's tax with the GST will mean that there will be no tax on goods used by companies, but hydro bills, for example, will be taxed. It is simple. The idea is not to have absolutely the same taxes, as several people have said. The idea is for the taxes to be identical.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427080">Why should we move to a harmonized system?</ParaText><ParaText id="1427081">Non-harmonized taxes apply to commodities that companies use to make manufactured goods. This type of tax adds to companies' production costs. By moving to a harmonized system where there is no tax on commodities companies use, we reduce production costs and improve productivity.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1427082">In other words, we are going from a tax system that imposes a tax on every stage of production to a system that only taxes the finished product. Adopting a single tax mechanism reduces the administrative costs of the tax system for business and government.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427083">I will speak to another point, that of harmonizing the sales tax in Ontario. Earlier, it was mentioned that things were done. In its 2009 budget, the Ontario government announced that it would receive compensation. To our surprise, the federal government was going to provide $4.3 billion over two years in compensation to cover the cost of the transition to this harmonized system. That is exactly what Quebec did. It paid and therefore is entitled to expect compensation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427084">In what way is the QST not perfectly harmonized with the GST? That is an excellent question. There is a minute difference in the refund of QST on inputs for large businesses. That is why, in order to completely harmonize the QST and GST, Ms. Jérôme-Forget, Quebec's finance minister up until a few days ago, announced on March 31, 2009 that she would establish a QST credit for large businesses, as Ottawa is doing. Given that we are prepared to do that, there should be no further disputes or misunderstandings on the part of the Conservative government. </ParaText><ParaText id="1427085">When did the province of Quebec harmonize its sales tax? In July 1992, or 17 years ago. Quebec did not receive any financial compensation from the federal government. For that reason, we now want compensation. Quebec has requested that it be responsible for PST administration on behalf of the federal government. Thus, the GST will be administered by Revenu Québec, which will forward the monies to the federal government. In exchange for this service, the Government of Quebec wants financial compensation. This type of compensation is not unique.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427086">In response to a question, earlier, a claim was made to the effect that the government has been giving Quebec money for years and that the total amount paid in compensation could be as high as $7.5 or $7.6 billion. That is not putting it quite right. The money is not simply given, it is payment for a service. That is different. Such compensation is not unique. The provinces for which the federal government administers income tax also have to compensate the government for its services, and there is no confusion about what that compensation is all about. They are simply paying for a service.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427087">Which provinces received federal assistance for the tax harmonization process? On April 1, 1997, the provinces of Newfoundland, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia received a first $250 million installment for harmonizing their sales taxes. Ontario will receive $4.3 billion from the federal government to harmonize its sales tax. Quebec, however, received no compensation. In other words, Quebec is the only province that has not received any compensation for harmonizing its sales tax.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427088">On what rules was the federal government's refusal to compensate Quebec based? The federal government allowed quite a while ago the Atlantic provinces to benefit from $1 billion over four years in compensation for harmonizing their sales taxes, all the while arguing that Quebec, as well as Ontario and British Columbia, would not be entitled to compensation because having harmonized taxes would not make their sales tax revenue drop by more than 5%.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427089">Time is flying. I wish I had time to get into the differences between the various provinces. At any rate, Quebec will have to pay one quarter of the $2.6 billion in compensation. After all, part of the money will be coming from our own taxes. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1427090">It would only be fair and reasonable, if every other province received compensation, that Quebec also receive compensation for having harmonized its sales tax.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427091">I hope that all members from Quebec, Conservative or not, will vote in favour of this motion. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

That was very efficient and the federal government noticed it. It said that the Quebec government was showing remarkable clarity and efficiency in collecting the tax.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427097">Everybody benefited. That meant that everybody was on the same level playing field as far as paying taxes was concerned. I remember that at that time the question of clarity in the payment of the tax was discussed.

					<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Ashton" id="2726095"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128733" Type="2">Ms. Niki Ashton (Churchill, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1427104">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address the Bloc Québécois' motion today.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427105">My party, the New Democratic Party, intends to support this motion. We agree in principle with a number of points in this motion. First, the provinces should be compensated fairly, regardless of the issue involved. Here, we are talking about the harmonization of taxes and the fact that Quebec should have been compensated a decade ago for the arrangement that it made with the federal government. Also, we note that the federal government has reached agreements with other regions, such as Ontario, without respecting the situation of Quebec.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427106">The first reason to support this motion is that we must absolutely recognize that the federal government has a responsibility to compensate each province fairly.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427107">It is truly a matter of fairness, and a province should not be treated differently than another in such cases. What happened in the past must be recognized, and we must ensure that, in the future, agreements with the other provinces will be respected.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427108">The second reason to support this motion is that it says that the federal government claimed to be prepared to find a solution, but only if the administration of taxes was transferred to it. We have a problem with that, since Quebec has been administering the tax system for several years already. Therefore, there is no reason for the federal government to now change what Quebec has been doing. We do not think this is appropriate.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427109">In the end, whether it is harmonization or another issue, we must ensure that Canadian consumers and families are not punished. Regardless of the decision we make on harmonization, we should keep in mind the current reality of Canadians, and also how the regulations and the legislation voted in this House affect them.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427110">Every day, our party comes to the House to talk about the issues and challenges facing Canadians, and to reflect on the fact that we, as their representatives, have a responsibility to help them.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427111">Of course, the government has more than one responsibility. It should, in every case, think about what is best for Canadians. We find that some aspects of harmonization pose a problem. We note that in Ontario harmonization will adversely affect consumers and their families. New taxes will be imposed on goods that have never been taxed. This is very problematic, because these goods are basic necessities of life. People's well-being should be the priority, and these goods should not be taxed.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427112">What is even more important is that we should think about the reality that Canadians must face right now. In a period of economic crisis, very large numbers of jobs are lost in many regions of the country, as is the case in Ontario and in Quebec. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1427113">In my region, there have been all time highs in job losses in the forestry and mining sectors as well as in a number of service industries that depend on those industries, which are truly crucial to our region. I feel it is extremely important for us as members to reach decisions on bills that consider the reality of Canadians and do nothing to penalize them when they are already in difficulty.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427114">I believe it is somewhat problematic when not only does this request have to be made in connection with harmonization, but also in terms of other rulings and decisions by this government. For example, the decision concerning employment insurance. Our leader, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128276" Type="2"> Toronto—Danforth</Affiliation>, has spoken about employment insurance and the fact that the changes made by the government did not benefit the bulk of those in need of it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427115">Because of my committee work, I realize the difficulties women face, especially those who wish to have access to employment insurance and cannot because of the regulations concerning the number of hours worked and the type of work they do. The few changes that have been made do nothing to support Canadians who have lost their jobs and are trying to benefit from a program into which they have paid for years. We can see what an extremely difficult situation they are in. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427116">There is also a lack of leadership as far as supporting Canadians rather than penalizing them is concerned. As for the motion which we introduced and which was passed by the House last week, this was a motion moved by my colleague, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128626" Type="2">Sudbury</Affiliation>. It had the support of the three opposition parties and we are really proud of it. It had to do with credit cards and the role the government should play in regulating the credit companies in order to really protect Canadians who find themselves in quite difficult financial straits. Many of them tend to make greater and greater use of their credit cards.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427117">We believe that the credit card companies continue to abuse their position rather than adopting measures like those that the Bank of Canada has adopted to reduce interest rates. We can see that this is a problematic situation. In fact, even if the House of Commons voted in favour of that motion as well as the one concerning changes in employment insurance, we can see that the government does not respect those results. In the end, Canadians are the ones who will bear the consequences, Canadians who are already in really difficult situations. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427118">I would also like to describe in more detail the difficult situation prevailing in my region. I am here to speak not only as a member of Parliament concerned by this question of tax harmonization, but also as a member of Parliament who sees this issue and the fair treatment of provinces as being directly related to my region, northern Manitoba.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1427119">Many of the challenges Canadians are faced with every day are to be found in my region. For example, a large majority of the people from the riding I represent come from one of more than 30 first nations. Many of them do not see the realities of the employment situation as conclusive. There is a lack of economic development which penalizes those people.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427120">It is also directly related to the taxation system. Of course, we know that, traditionally, people from the first nations do not pay taxes in their own region, but when they go out in the urban areas, the reality is not the same. When they come, for example, in my community of Thompson—the business centre in our region—, and they go shopping, they must pay taxes. And, for many of them who suffer from a low rate of employability, since many are unemployed or in quite difficult situations, the idea of paying taxes when outside of their community is difficult to bear.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427121">Generally speaking, the tax situation in Manitoba is a bit different, because we have our own provincial tax. It must also be acknowledged that, in addition to the taxation problem, there are problems relating to plant closures or layoffs, which result in these industries paying less tax to the urban communities they are located in, and of course also to the federal government. This is fairly problematic for our communities, which most of the time depend on a single industry and on the provincial tax to invest in our services: recreation, infrastructure, water. It is the entire community that suffers in such situations.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427122">It must also be acknowledged that, when we speak of taxes here, we are speaking of the Bloc Québécois motion, the Quebec reality and the necessity to respect its situation. It must also be acknowledged that, when we speak of taxes, decisions must be reached that encompass not only the well-being of individuals, of each Canadian, but also that of our communities and our regions which are at present experiencing some unfortunate and historic circumstances because of the economic crisis.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427123">I will make another point: the reference in the Bloc Québécois motion that “the government should negotiate in good faith with the Government of Quebec”. We believe that the two words “good faith” are really the focal point of this motion, the idea of the need to negotiate with our provinces on an equal footing and to really recognize the matter of equity here. This matter of good faith does not apply solely to negotiations with Quebec. It is important, of course, because that is what we are talking about today. But this matter of good faith also applies as a general rule to the discussions we have in this House and with our provinces. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1427124">We must recognize that Canada is in a rather unique position in the world as a federation and that, in the past, certain provinces had considerable control over their own regions. The federal government must really work in partnership with the provinces in all areas in order to be able to improve the lives of Canadians, whether in Manitoba, Quebec, the Yukon or Prince Edward Island. </ParaText><ParaText id="1427125">No matter where one lives, one must recognize that Canada is a federation. We must negotiate in good faith on all kinds of matters. For instance, equalization is still being discussed. The government made a number of promises in that regard, but later broke them, especially concerning Newfoundland and Labrador. It is extremely problematic. As politicians, we all know it is extremely important to keep our promises, but even more so, we all know the consequences of breaking our promises. We saw what happened concerning equalization and the frustration expressed by the people of Atlantic Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427126">We also now recognize Quebec's frustration regarding the agreement it reached with the federal government several years ago. That agreement must be respected. If we are going to talk about compensation, we must respect the fact that Quebec has been administering the tax system for several years.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427127">I will conclude today with the following message. We hope that good faith and the well-being of Canadians will remain in the forefront. Canadians must not be penalized by new taxes, credit card problems or employment insurance. As leaders and representatives in this House, we must help them. This is an important message, which will guide us in our decision making, and all of Canada will benefit as a result. In this case, we are talking about Quebec, but all of Canada will benefit. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Even the Quebec government has admitted such, recently admitting that there was a major difference between the QST and the GST and that the province was ready to agree to make the necessary adjustments for full harmonization.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427156">Quebec currently administers the Quebec sales tax and the GST in Quebec on behalf of the federal government. The federal government compensates the Quebec government for doing this. In 2007-08, approximately $130 million was paid to Quebec to administer the GST.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427157">On this motion, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> has been clear. He has spoken to Quebec's new finance minister about this issue and he is open to discussions with the new minister on this matter. As outlined in an op-ed in the Montreal <I>Gazette</I>, the new Quebec finance minister is “--prepared to sit down and discuss the issue”.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427158">The previous Quebec finance minister, who recently stepped down, was also very content with the stance of the federal government on this issue. An April 2009 press release states:</ParaText><ParaText id="1427159"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The Minister of Finance and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Monique Jérôme-Forget, welcomed the openness shown by the federal government regarding fair treatment for Québec with respect to the harmonization of sales taxes.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1427160">We notice something here, though. These negotiations will not and cannot involve the Bloc, for the Bloc, as it has shown in its nearly 20 years of perpetual opposition, cannot obtain results for Quebec or for Quebeckers, just debate. In a little over four years, our Conservative Quebec caucus has managed to do more for Quebec than the Bloc MPs ever can or ever will do.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427161">For instance, total federal support for Quebec in 2008-09 was $16.8 billion, an increase of $4.5 billion or 37% since 2005-06 under the old Liberal government, including increased support for health care, post-secondary education and for infrastructure. In 2009-10, Quebec will receive over $8.3 billion in equalization alone. That is a huge increase of over 70% since 2005-06 levels under the old defeated Liberal government. That is nearly as much as was transferred to all provinces for the program in 2003-04. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427162">In terms of background, the harmonized sales tax framework involves Canada and the province harmonizing its sales tax with the GST under a federal-provincial comprehensive integrated tax coordination agreement. Such an agreement would include the following key elements: the provincial portion of the harmonized sales tax being imposed under federal legislation; a tax base essentially mirroring the GST base with the provincial portion of the tax not applying to the GST; provincial revenues paid according to the HST revenue allocation framework; and finally, federal administration by the Canada Revenue Agency and the Canada Border Services Agency of the federal and provincial components of the harmonized tax.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427163">The HST framework is simpler and less costly as it involves only one tax rate, one substantially harmonized tax base, with no need to track and report tax on a by-province basis, and one level of tax administration.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427164">I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Liberal leader and the Liberal Party for finally unveiling the Liberal's very own economic action plan. While it was months after the actual budget and it only contains one idea, it is great to finally see the Liberals bringing a plan forward, and what a plan. It is a plan that really speaks to what Canadians expect of Liberals. It is a plan that speaks to the type of Liberal thinking Canadians have become all too familiar with. It is a plan that we know will be met with the reaction it so richly deserves when fully exposed to the public.</ParaText>

We will have to raise taxes”. I note that the early reception to the Liberal plan has not been as favourable as the Liberals would have liked. Almost everyone has suggested that this is perhaps the last thing the Canadian economy needs right now. Almost everyone agrees that the Liberal plan will only serve to stunt economic recovery or to bleed more jobs.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427166">Unfortunately for the Liberal leader, some commentators were particularly displeased.

							<ParaText id="1427169">The Canadian Taxpayers Federation said that “Canadians....find the idea of raising taxes now or after the recession subsides 'scary'”.</ParaText>

We understand that items under consideration include a 1% or 2% GST tax hike to ensure fixed income seniors, working families and others pay more to the government when they can afford it the least. </ParaText><ParaText id="1427173">Furthermore, Canadians may once again feel the sting of that old favourite, the regressive carbon tax.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427174">No wonder many Canadians are demanding more fulsome answers on what the Liberal plan actually involves. Which taxes will the Liberals raise? Will they implement the carbon tax? Will they hike the GST? Will they do both? By how much will the Liberals raise taxes and when will the taxes rise? Canadians want to know.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427175">A recent editorial in Waterloo's <I>The Record</I> states:</ParaText><ParaText id="1427176"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Canadians deserve to know in clear, unambiguous language the Liberal leader's stand on a tax hike.</QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427177">Again, the Liberal leader was unequivocal and clear when he unveiled his own economic action plan last week and said, “Federal taxes must go up.... We will have to raise taxes” . It sounds to me like that is plural taxes, which clearly suggests that there is more than one tax to be raised under the Liberals' economic action plan.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427178">We already know that the GST will likely be raised under the Liberal plan from an earlier statement made by the Liberal leader when he said, “Let me be clear here...you can't exclude tax increases.... So I'm not going to take a GST hike off the table”.</ParaText>

There was Ms. Pauline Marois and the members of the Parti Québecois and also the member of Québec Solidaire, who know very well that sovereignty is the only solution to the ongoing constitutional wrangling. So they obviously supported it. But it was not only sovereignists—those the evil “separatists”, with for or five s's at the end, that we sometimes hear about in this House—who supported it. It is not just the sovereignists who are calling for this. There are two federalist parties—well, we are not sure what one of them stands for. There is the premier of Quebec, Jean Charest, who can definitely not be accused of being a sovereignist. He was once a member of a Conservative government. He is a good friend of Paul Desmarais and company and a strong federalist. He supported this resolution. Not only did he vote in favour of it but he supported the initiative of his then finance minister, also a federalist. Therefore, it is not a Bloc Québécois fantasy. There is clearly a consensus in Quebec.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427212">What does this consensus say? First, we want to continue administering our own sales tax. If it must be harmonized, administration of this tax by the federal government is clearly out of the question. The opposite should prevail, as is presently the case. The federal government should allow the Government of Quebec to administer the tax, in return for appropriate compensation. That is the most logical thing to do and that is what is being done already.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427213">Second, in the interest of equity and justice, compensation must be provided on the same basis as it has been to the other provinces. In addition, a quarter of this compensation from the federal government is paid by Quebec taxpayers. Thus, we are not to be treated any differently.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427214">The motion before us speaks to all this. I found it unfortunate that the Conservative Party attempted, unsuccessfully, to propose an amendment to the motion that would delete the second part. This second part calls on the government to “provide $2.6 billion in compensation to Quebec for this harmonization, and that Quebec continue to administer these harmonized taxes.” This amendment would have weakened the motion, the consensus of the National Assembly and Quebec. Who moved this motion? Was it a member from Ontario, a province that will be receiving $4.6 billion in compensation, which Quebec has not received?</ParaText>

						</PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1427224"> moved that Bill <Document DbId="3627162" Type="4">C-279, An Act to amend the Employment Insurance Act (amounts not included in earnings)</Document>, be read the second time and referred to a committee. </ParaText><ProceduralText TocType="TPC" id="8">Bill C-279. Second reading</ProceduralText><ParaText id="1427225"> He said: Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to debate my private member's bill today on the issue of severance and vacation pay for those who may receive it for pension income.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427226">The EI act looks at moneys in certain ways. It sometimes takes it into income and sometimes it does not. Sometimes it treats it in a different manner. In the case of severance pay, which is due employees upon their termination of employment, it treats that income differently, as if they were actually collecting employment insurance and out in the workforce.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427227"> At this moment in time, the gross up provision, which is an anomaly in the act, says that individuals can earn 40% of a claim up to $179 while on a claim. The act takes severance and deducts that dollar for dollar from their claim and leaves those individuals with less because they have severance rather than if they had actually taken on part-time work and deducted that in a different manner. This is really an inequitable system.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427228">The nub of all this is that severance pay is really about pay for time that has gone before. In other words, in some situations individuals would get paid a week for every year that they may have been employed.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427229">There are two parts of the act that talk about earnings as paid and payable. I would suggest that we ought to look at severance pay the way we did some 20 years ago when it was not used as a calculation for unemployment insurance. It was deemed to have been paid because it really was for the time that individuals spent prior to their termination because that is how it was generated in the first place. Severance pay is not paid on a go forward basis in the sense that individuals would be paid for what they might have worked. They are actually being paid for the time they did work.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427230">At some point the act was changed to have those moneys deducted. Severance was seen to be as if someone was working but clearly they were not. That is why they were given severance pay. The reason it is called severance pay is because the individual was severed from employment.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427231">What happened? What transpired that changed the system? We have to go back some 20 years and look at the changes that started to come into effect during the latter part of the eighties and well into the nineties under the leadership of two previous governments. The Conservatives enacted some changes in the 1980s. During the nineties, the Liberal government made a wholesale change of the system, reducing the number of people who qualified from a high of nearly 86% back in 1990 to the lows we see today, which is less than one in two, just slightly under 50%.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427232">Why did that occur? What situation was so dramatic that the unemployment system needed to be changed wholesale? </ParaText><ParaText id="1427233">The first question we need to ask is whether or not the system had enough money. The obvious answer to that is, no, because we know the surplus in the EI system during the nineties and into the early 2000s was approximately $54 billion. That money rightfully belonged to workers who had paid into the system, who were rightfully entitled to receive benefits from that system, and who saw the system actually become denigrated to the point where they were no longer able to collect from that system.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427234">The obvious question to ask is, what happened to the $54 billion? Some of us are still asking that question today. It seems as if that money has vanished. In fact, some say it has been absconded. Some say it went to the surpluses of the Liberal government that preceded this Conservative government. Liberals wracked up those great surpluses talking about economic management. What the Liberal government actually did was take it from those who paid into the system and then denied them entry into the system. One has to wonder, what if we had left the $54 billion in there, would we need to drawback the severance pay of those who, at this point in their lives, need it?</ParaText><ParaText id="1427235">This reminds me of the story of a young woman in Oshawa who received a severance package when she was laid off. She no longer lived with her parents, who had been laid off before her. Her father asked if she could assist them because they were going to lose their house because they were going to default on their mortgage. He was still waiting for employment insurance. His severance pay was basically gone because he had to use it up before he qualified for EI. She agreed to turn over her severance pay to help them keep their house. That is what families in this country do for one another.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1427236">However, under this present system, she has signed herself into poverty. The fact that she gave the severance package to her parents does not negate the fact that she will have to wait an equal amount of time of that severance pay. It would be exhausted out before she is eligible to qualify for EI. And if she qualifies subsequent to that, she would then collect.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427237">For ease of example, if she is entitled to eight weeks worth of severance and she gives it to her parents, she will have no income for the next eight weeks. Employment insurance will not pay her one thin dime because of that. She will wait out those eight weeks and the two week waiting period for a total of 10 weeks. She will fill out a report for the next two weeks, perhaps on the third week, which will now take her to week 15. If she is extremely lucky and the system works the way it is supposed to, she will receive her first cheque on week 16. In the meantime, she has no source of income because the severance pay that has been allocated for her has all but been exhausted because of her willingness to help her parents.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427238">When we look at that, it tells us there is something wrong with the system. The system was never designed to take people's severance pay. Severance pay was never designed to be seen as earnings. It is for income tax purposes, but it was never designed to be a qualifier for EI. That is the way the act was initially. </ParaText><ParaText id="1427239">This bill talks about the future, but it goes back to the past at the same time to recapture the days when the system actually worked for the unemployed. That is not the way it works now.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427240">When it comes to the issue of why it should be changed, it begs the question of why it changed. We are still waiting for that answer. No one from either government, Liberal or Conservative, has been able to explain to us that it was changed out of necessity. One might posit the suggestion that it was changed to reduce the EI premium. I think if we went to workers and asked them if they really needed $2 or $3 off their EI premium every week, which is basically a cup of coffee and a doughnut, most would probably say, “No, thank you”. They would ask us to keep the premium the way it was and to keep that money in the system so that if they perchance get laid off, the system will be there to protect them.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427241">Twenty years ago, individuals could collect more money on EI than they can today. Think about that. Twenty years ago, we could collect more dollar for dollar on EI, of course at that time we called it unemployment insurance, than we can today under the present employment insurance system because it used to be 66% of earnings. It as driven down to 60%. It has now been driven down to 55%. Unless we get changes, we are going to see more folks in poverty than we have ever seen in this country's history.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427242">Because of the system that we pay into, those of us who work, those Canadians out there who toil every day, who are paying their premium on a regular basis in good faith expecting to qualify, are finding themselves thrown onto this heap. It becomes a maze for them and it becomes this whole system of inequity. For them, that is an injustice because it is their system. It does not belong to us. It does not belong to the House. It belongs to workers. Those are the folks who contributed. Those are the folks who built up the fund. Those are the folks who built up the surplus.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427243">Those are the folks who expected to draw on a surplus in a time of need. Now, when they find an absolute time of need, what do they find? The surplus is not there. We are not sure where it went. There is some conjecture about where it went. They are not sure where it went. Their hard-earned money disappeared. They ask if they can get into the system. They want to be treated the same as others across this land and, indeed, they are not. We have workers in certain parts of this country who have to have more hours than others.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427244">There is an easy fix to all of this. New Democrats proposed and received the majority approval of the House to make changes. We asked the government to do that. At this economic moment in time, Canadians who work hard every day, pay into the system, and play by the rules are telling the government to listen to what they are saying. They need change. They need the system to be modified the way it once was, when it protected them as workers when they were unemployed. That is all they are asking for. They are not asking for their taxes to be raised. They are not asking for a government handout. They are just asking for some of the money they put in back.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1427245">I do not think that is an unfair request. In fact, I would suggest that is a more than reasonable request because ultimately it was theirs in the first place. We collected for them as a government and as a Parliament and we administered it for them. They gave us their money in trust, not for us to do willy-nilly whatever the government wanted depending on the flavour of the day. Workers said to us, “Here is our hard-earned money, it is our insurance premium. We expect to collect our insurance when we need it”. What have they found now that they really need it? It is not there and now we have made all these rules to make sure they are excluded so we can push them aside, so we can tell them they just do not qualify in the system, sorry. Yes, they paid their premium, but we are sorry about the fact that they do not qualify.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427246">Instead we can reverse the system. We could go back to what it once was. We could go back to a day when 86% of those who paid into the system qualified within the system. We could go back to a day where 66% of earnings were qualified as insurable earnings and were paid. As members of Parliament, who live on a salary which is very commendable and very lucrative, I defy any of us to wake up tomorrow and say we are going to work on 55 cent dollars. In our case, if we were unemployed tomorrow, we would be collecting $435 a week and I would have a hard time thinking that most of us in the House would actually manage to live on that. But again, that is the high end. That is not the average. The average is close to $340 a week. Living on $340 a week before deductions, because people still pay income tax on that, and raise a family is impossible.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427247">We know all of those things and the government knows all of those things. It talks about statistics of who qualifies and who does not. It tells us every day that it understands the needs out there. Ministers stand in their place every day and tell us they understand. If the government truly understands, it should change the system. We are not asking to reinvent it. It does not have to because we basically told it how to do it. New Democrats, with our friends in the opposition benches who voted for it, put a plan in front of the government so it did not have to go to the department to get it rejigged and all those marvellous things. It simply has to enact it. It could go back to 1993 and bring that act forward and implement it again. I am sure the Parliamentary Library has a copy. It would be dead easy. It will not be hard or difficult.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427248">Canadians who are unemployed will be forever grateful, not just to the government but to all of us in the House because it is about all of our constituents. There is no constituency in this land that does not have someone unemployed. Not one of us has full employment in our area, so we are dealing on behalf of all our constituents. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427249">It is an absolute crime if we are not willing to raise the hand that we are fully capable of doing in the House, raising that hand to our fellow Canadians who find themselves in a time of need through no fault of their own. Unemployment is not a choice. The rules are clear, if people quit a job they do not qualify. We need the will of the House to have the government implement what has been spoken from this side.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427250">As we look at the situation, it never was lucrative to be on employment insurance. For those who think it was, they are absolutely misleading folks. If anyone had been on employment insurance, they would know it is not lucrative. </ParaText><ParaText id="1427251">For the government, now is the opportunity to make changes. The NDP motion has shown how to mend a system that is truly broken. I ask the government to do the right thing and accept the NDP changes and correct an EI system that the previous Liberal government destroyed. Now is the government's opportunity to say that it knew better than the Liberals when they were in government and it has fixed it for workers. Workers will forever be grateful. Conservatives should not lose that opportunity.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Some of what he has said makes good sense.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427253">However, there was a provision for improvements to the EI system, which we put before the House for a vote. It included a five week extension that would help approximately 400,000 people, a work-sharing agreement that would help approximately 80,000 people and skills upgrading and training that would assist about 190,000 people. That was about a $4.5 billion stimulus injection through improvements to the system and the member's party voted against each and every one of those proposals.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427254">How can the member justify that at this time in the economy?

Five weeks of nothing is still nothing. If someone does not qualify, five weeks makes no difference.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427256">The Association of Universities and Colleges has said quite clearly that if the government does not provide somewhere close to about $1.5 billion to build spaces in community colleges, those apprenticeship programs will not mean a tinker because no one will have a seat to sit in.

I think it is very clear that more needs to be done in the employment insurance system. The government has failed Canadians miserably, particularly those who are losing their jobs through no fault of their own.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427260">There are a number of ways the EI system can be changed. The member has mentioned a number of them. They were in a motion before the House about a month ago, for which a majority in the House voted. He is making the case on his bill tonight.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427261">Specific to his bill, can he talk about some of the stakeholders or organizations who support it? Has he had a chance to do any costing as to what the incremental cost to the employment insurance fund might be if we did go back? He is right.

					<Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Allen (Welland)" id="2726813"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128407" Type="2">Mr. Malcolm Allen</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1427262">Mr. Speaker, as far as those who are supportive of the bill, Canadian workers are supportive. I need no other validators besides Canadian workers. Those working and those who are unemployed have said to me for the past 20 years in which I have been an EI advocate in different venues that this is what they want to see happen. I have not met a laid off worker yet who has not said, “My severance shouldn't be touched”. </ParaText><ParaText id="1427263">As far as the costing, it is simply a delaying tactic. Severance delays unemployment insurance. People can still collect the same amount of employment insurance at the end. If they are so unfortunate as to be unemployed that length of time, they simply eat up their severance and their entitlement to EI.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427264">There is no cost to the EI system per se because of severance pay. What it does do is it lets people keep their house. It perhaps lets people keep their youngsters who may be involved in recreational or cultural activities in those activities for perhaps an extra month or two. It keeps people out of abject poverty hopefully until they can get a job. That is what keeping their severances does, at no cost to the EI fund. They will qualify for EI anyway and they will collect those numbers of weeks. The old argument was, if people received EI from day one, and had eight weeks worth of severance, we could take that out of the fund by that eight weeks.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427265">In this day and age that is not the case. We all know that. The workers are entitled to it. They ought to be able to keep it. Hopefully the House will pass the bill.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Komarnicki" id="2726815"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128852" Type="18">Mr. Ed Komarnicki (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development and to the Minister of Labour, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1427266">Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to join in the discussion of Bill <Document DbId="3627162" Type="4">C-279</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427267">Our economic action plan commitments to improve the EI program clearly indicate the employment insurance program is very important to our government. It is important to Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427268">The bill put forward by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128407" Type="2">Welland</Affiliation> proposes that pension benefits, vacation pay and severance payments, collectively called separation payments, not be included in earnings under the Employment Insurance Act and therefore will not reduce benefits under the act. While this government appreciates the sentiment behind the bill, it is important that we look at the central premise of employment insurance and that this debate be put in context.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427269">At the core of the employment insurance program is the insured-based objective that EI benefits are available to those individuals who are facing a loss of employment income. To be consistent with this objective, it naturally follows that, under the EI program, separation payments be considered as income arising from employment, and that is what they are.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427270"> The rationale behind the current system is that benefits are not paid simultaneously as, in reality, there is no loss of employment income. Once the time allocated to separation money expires, EI benefits can be collected. People are not losing EI benefits, it is saying they must use up the earnings from employment, or the income, first. When that is used up, then they go on EI. Severance payments are there to replace lost income. It is something that happens by negotiation between employer and employee. It is something that is paid out through legal action. That is meant to replace employment loss and it should be used up.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427271">As things currently stand, the EI program makes provision for workers who receive separation payments to have their benefit periods extended by each week for which separation moneys are paid up to a maximum of 104 weeks. This means that EI claimants are eligible to collect EI benefits over that period of time. EI can continue up to a maximum of 104 weeks.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427272">For example, if claimants qualify for 45 weeks of benefits and receives separation pay that equals 6 months of regular salary, they may receive their benefits provided they are still unemployed, once this initial 6 month period has elapsed. Therefore, claimants use up the six months, then go on EI and they are entitled to the full benefits.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427273">If we use this example, while these individuals may not be able to receive EI benefits for a six month period, they, through their separation pay, already have employment income to live off for six months. Given that these individuals have income to live off for six months, the current system assumes they have not suffered the loss of employment income for this period of employment.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427274">While the obvious effect of the bill would be to remove separation payments from amounts that may be deducted from benefits payable, it is important to note that the full implications of this proposal are difficult to determine. </ParaText><ParaText id="1427275">For example, as the bill proposes to change the definition of earnings throughout the EI Act, it is not clear how the amendment may affect what would be considered to be insurable earnings and how it would affect premiums collected. Premiums have to be paid. As benefits are extended, premiums have to be increased. The ramifications could be quite substantial and would require considerable effort to clarify.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427276">It is therefore difficult to estimate the full cost of implementing the changes proposed in the bill. Looking solely at exempting separation moneys for determination of EI benefits, the cost would be approximately $130 million annually.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427277">Our government is always concerned when Canadians lose their job. We understand the pressures faced by Canadian families during these challenging times. That is why, through our economic action plan, we will help over 400,000 people benefit from an additional five weeks of EI benefits. We will help 190,000 people, including long-tenured and older workers, get retrained to find a new job and put food on the table for their families.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427278">Our government has heard the needs of Canadians and will continue to deliver the protection they need to get through these difficult times. We recognize that during these challenging economic times, more and more people are unfortunately losing their jobs.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427279"> People who have lost or are at risk of losing their jobs need to know that their government is working hard for them to get them the assistance they need. That is why, as part of our action plan, we are investing an unprecedented $8.3 billion in Canada skills and training transition. Looking at that, it is a huge amount of dollars. With this strategy, we are making use of employment insurance to bolster benefits and invest in skills training.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1427280">Our government remains committed to having a highly skilled, globally competitive workforce. Helping Canadians receive training is essential to meeting this goal. That is why important changes to EI also include supporting long-term training for those workers who have been in the labour force for many years and have not made significant use of EI. For these workers, we are extending EI income support for the duration of training up to two years. These are moneys well spent, positioning people for the time when this economy changes.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427281">I would also like to highlight that in our economic action plan, we committed to allowing earlier access to EI regular income benefits for eligible individuals investing in their own training, using all or part of their separation package. If they use all or part of that, EI would then kick in. Training and skills development are key to helping permanently laid off workers who need to change occupations or sectors, preparing our nation for the jobs of tomorrow.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427282">Our proposal will help unemployed Canadians invest in the training they need for the jobs of the future, while allowing them to receive their EI benefits sooner.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427283"> Our government is also assisting laid off workers by providing nationally the advantage of an extra five weeks of EI benefits previously offered as part of a pilot project that was only provided in specific regions with high unemployment. Additionally, the maximum duration of benefits available under the EI program has been increased from 45 weeks to 50 weeks. These changes mean that unemployed Canadians, who otherwise would have exhausted their benefits, will receive financial support for a longer period of time. These new measures became available on March 1.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427284">These are some of the measures that the Government of Canada is taking to temporarily provide additional income support to unemployed workers facing transitions in tough economic times.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427285"> Our government has also taken steps to provide assistance to unemployed individuals who are unable to qualify for EI benefits at all. By establishing a new strategic training and transition fund, we are investing $500 million over two years to help these individuals obtain training and other support measures. In the event they do not qualify for EI, this program and fund is available for them. We understand that the provinces and territories know local needs best, so these funds will be delivered through existing labour market agreements.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427286">Our plan also takes into account that, in economic downturns, it would often be older workers who would be most severely affected. To provide them with greater assistance, we are investing an additional $60 million over three years in the targeted initiative for older workers program. We are also expanding its reach so communities with a population fewer than 250,000 will now be eligible for funding. It makes no difference if these communities are located in larger metropolitan areas. They are still eligible. Our plan provides additional support to unemployed Canadians over the short term and is designed to meet the needs of the current economy while helping Canadians get the skills they need for the jobs of tomorrow.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427287">We believe that while the intent of this legislation is laudable, the wording of it is unclear. If passed, it could have considerable impacts on the fiscal framework and significant implications on other aspects of the EI program that are unclear at this time.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427288"> As I mentioned earlier, our government is already proposing a measure that will allow earlier access to EI benefits if individuals use some or all of their separation payments to purchase skills upgrading or training for themselves.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427289">These initiatives, when taken as a package, are meant to address the needs of Canadians. It is unfortunate that the member and members of his party oppose each and every one of these proposals, such as extending the EI program by five weeks. It matters very much to those Canadians who are still looking for a job and have not found one. That five weeks is very significant. It matters to those who want to job share to ensure that all of them have an opportunity to work, while the economy recovers. There are 190,000 people who want to get their skills upgraded and want to have training so they are prepared to enter the job market of the future.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427290">That party has opposed and voted against very important measures. In fact, it said that it was going to vote against them before it had an opportunity to read and understand what these measures were. One has to look at this whole picture as a package.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Clearly, he understands the issue, cares about it passionately and has given a great deal of thought to it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427292">I want to start by talking about how big an issue employment insurance is in Canada right now. Today we got word that according to Statistics Canada a staggering 325,700 EI claims were received in February. That is up 51,000, some 18%, from January. That is the largest number of EI claims since the tracking of EI data began. The total number of regular EI beneficiaries has climbed 22% since October 2008. Today there are well over 600,000 Canadians collecting benefits. </ParaText><ParaText id="1427293">This issue is gripping Canadians. I would say it is an issue that is gripping Canadians who for many years probably thought, not in an arrogant way but because of history, that they would not be touched by a faltering economy. However, now they are, through no fault of their own.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427294">The government's response has been very weak. When the economy started to dip a bit last year, instead of dealing with it, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> decided to call an election. In the fall when Barack Obama was already talking about a stimulus package, the Conservative government came out with an economic update that did nothing to stimulate the economy but did a lot to stimulate politics in Canada. Then in January when we finally came back here, yes, there had been an improvement. </ParaText><ParaText id="1427295">The parliamentary secretary, from his briefing notes that we just heard him read, spoke about the additional five weeks. That was helpful to a small percentage of Canadians, the less than half of Canadians who can claim EI. There was some money for training. There is so much more to be done. It is not just what people sometimes refer to as the usual suspects, the social policy groups, the anti-poverty organizations and organized labour, but even organizations like the C.D. Howe Institute have said that they were surprised the government did not do more on EI.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427296">Today at the human resources committee, we were doing an anti-poverty study. My colleague from the Sault who is in the House tonight is well aware of this. Armine Yalnizyan from the CCPA, Dennis Howlett from Make Poverty History, and Canada Without Poverty, formerly NAPO, the National Anti-Poverty Organization all spoke about how important EI is as part of the country's social infrastructure.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427297">The simple fact is our EI system, as we know it today, is not recession tested. So how do we fix that? Our colleague has brought forward his idea. There are other things we could do, obviously. We have a regional rate system, and maybe we could go to a national standard. That has been called for. We could increase the percentage of earnings that an individual could qualify for, a maximum of 55% of $42,000. It is still not exactly as my colleague said, it is not 55% of replacement earnings for somebody who maybe had been working in the auto sector or had another job. Maybe we could look at that. Maybe we could go to the best 12 weeks. </ParaText><ParaText id="1427298">Maybe it is time we seriously looked at the structural issues of EI, as to how they affect women and part-time workers who are not well treated in the EI system. We know that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427299">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128523" Type="2">Cape Breton—Canso</Affiliation> is in the House tonight. He was on the human rights committee, along with others, when it looked at this issue. Up until 1984, I think, severance was dealt with separately. People did not lose EI because they had received a severance payment. I think Michael Wilson was the finance minister when that was changed. It was the way things were done. The human resources committee has looked at it before and has done some work on this.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427300">How do we prioritize what we are going to do on EI, and where does this bill fit in with that? I do not think it is right to say that there is not a cost. There is a cost to the system, but it may well be a justifiable cost.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427301">With respect to the EI fund, as people know, there has been a surplus each year for the last number of years of what has been paid in and what has been paid out. Some money is there, even in normal times, that we could look at when it comes to the need of the country for a stronger social infrastructure.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427302">There was a point in time when the percentage of replacement earnings was about 75% to 77% in Canada. We have to look at those things. We have to determine in each case what is the cost and what is the benefit.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="50">(1750)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1427303">We also have to remember that this recession is an opportunity to focus on the needs of our social infrastructure, but issues existed before, things like regional rates, how women, largely part-time workers, are affected. We need to do some things.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427304">Vacation pay is for work that was provided in the year directly previous to somebody being severed from his or her employment. That should not affect EI. </ParaText><ParaText id="1427305">The question on severance is a little more complicated. There are many arguments in favour. Some workers have worked for the same company for many years. They put their heart and soul into that company. They should be treated well for their service when they are let go. Those workers paid into EI for years. Why should they not draw some kind of full benefit from the employment insurance system?</ParaText><ParaText id="1427306">Maybe there are other possibilities. Maybe there should be lump sum protection in the EI system. Maybe there should be a specific percentage clawback. These are things that we could look at. It may be that more evaluation is required.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427307">This is an indication of the kinds of problems we have with the EI system. At their time of hardship, people are not getting the financial support that this country is well known for and the kind of financial support they expect.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427308">Some anti-poverty groups say that if issues on EI are going to be prioritized, this would not be in the top five. They think we should get rid of regional rates, look at the two-week waiting period, and maybe even add more than five weeks to the employment insurance system, as is being done in the United States. </ParaText><ParaText id="1427309">I get emails, as do all MPs. I received an email from somebody the other day who had been laid off without any severance package at all. It took her more than a year to get fairness from her company. She eventually won her case and the company had to pay her a lump sum, but employment insurance clawed back the money. </ParaText><ParaText id="1427310">These people are not rich. EI is not a lucrative system, contrary to what the minister has indicated. The minister said she was concerned about making employment insurance too lucrative. She did not want to pay people not to work. That is a throwback to Reform Party days. At $440 maximum earnings a week, and an average of $335 a week, employment insurance is not too lucrative. We could afford to do a lot more for Canadians than what we are doing for them right now. The Conservative government has to act.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427311">There was the other spectacle regarding the two-week waiting period. That is really a misnomer. It is not a waiting period; it is a period during which the individual does not receive benefits. The waiting period is how long an individual has to wait to get a claim processed. We have seen ample evidence in this country of people waiting a long time. The standard, according to Service Canada, is that 80% of claims are dealt with in 28 days or less. That has slipped dramatically.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427312">On November 27 I stood in the House and asked a question of the <Affiliation DbId="128694" Type="4">Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development</Affiliation> about this. On December 19 I sent her a letter. Two months later I received a letter from her apologizing for the delay in getting back to me about my concern about delays.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427313">The government has not made employment insurance adjustment a priority. It has not put a priority on building that social infrastructure that makes Canada strong. As a result, people are hurting severely.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427314">Bill <Document DbId="3627162" Type="4">C-279</Document> brings up the issue of severance. It brings up the issue of pensions in some cases. It brings up the issue of vacation pay in some cases. </ParaText><ParaText id="1427315">I want to congratulate my colleague for bringing this bill forward. I want to congratulate many colleagues in the House. I see my colleague from the Bloc, who has brought forward measures on EI that have come to our committee for consideration.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427316">We need to make sure the government understands that the EI system needs to be more robust, especially during a recession. </ParaText><ParaText id="1427317">Somebody back home said to me that a recession is too important a thing to waste. In other words, let us do something about poverty in this country. Let us do something about the social infrastructure, including employment insurance.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427318">I congratulate the member for <Affiliation DbId="128407" Type="2">Welland</Affiliation> for bringing this issue up.

This strikes us as totally fair under the circumstances.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427320">What we feel is unfair is the present situation. Like my colleague who spoke before me, I wish to congratulate the member for <Affiliation DbId="128407" Type="2"> Welland </Affiliation>for bringing this bill before the House, a bill that I feel will result in a little more humanity in our employment insurance program.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427321">It is also a good time to remind hon. members that the Bloc Québécois has intervened in a number of ways over many years in order to correct this program which has, over time, been gradually destroyed by the two parties each in turn. With respect to benefits when there is money owed to the worker after he leaves, the Conservatives are the ones who imposed that limitation on benefits in 1985. From the 1990s on, the Liberals in turn adopted various measures to limit as much as possible any access to EI. This is one such measure.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427322">Fortunately, as we have just heard from our colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128521" Type="2">Dartmouth—Cole Harbour</Affiliation>, the Liberal Party has rethought its position. That member has brought in some slightly more equitable thinking in order to remedy this situation, which is absolutely unfair to the unemployed. One of the measures in which our colleagues have participated, particularly those in the Liberal Party and the NDP, were discussed at the time of the 2005 examination of employment insurance reform. </ParaText><ParaText id="1427323">Recommendation 23 was focused specifically on correcting that shortcoming. The committee wanted to see the EI regulations not include in calculations of income for benefit purposes any pension income, severance payments or vacation pay. This measure has therefore been in existence since 2005 and two successive governments have not acted on it. I must also indicate, as the preceding speakers have done, that this is only one of the measures that needs to be put in place in order to restore the employment insurance program. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427324">There are currently a number of bills before the House of Commons about this issue. The Bloc introduced four of those bills, and I myself introduced one on behalf of the party. Bill <Document DbId="3627293" Type="4">C-308</Document> calls for the following amendments. It would change the qualifying period to 360 hours of work. People would have to work 30 hours per week for a period of 12 weeks to accumulate 360 hours. This measure would eliminate the existing disparity that excludes unemployed workers based on unemployment rates in each region.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427325">The bill would also increase the rate of benefits, which is currently 55%, to 60%. Unemployment organizations, anti-poverty organizations, unions, and even the three opposition parties, if their participation in the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities is any indication, are unanimous in their support of this initiative.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="00">(1800)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1427326">This bill, Bill <Document DbId="3627293" Type="4">C-308</Document>, eliminates the distinctions between a new entrant and a re-entrant to the labour force. That distinction discriminates against women because they are often in unstable jobs and are more likely to be laid off. Also, many women work in so-called atypical part-time jobs. This bill also eliminates the presumption that persons related to each other do not deal with each other at arm’s length; the department must prove it. The bill also increases the maximum yearly insurable earnings to $42,500. That is all in Bill C-308. It is useful to bear these bills in mind.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427327">Then there is Bill <Document DbId="3627755" Type="4">C-241</Document>, introduced by my Bloc colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128316" Type="2">Brome—Missisquoi</Affiliation>, which eliminates the waiting period. I am not the first member to have raised this issue. Tomorrow, in the late afternoon, we will be voting on this bill at second reading. I would urge my colleagues in the House to vote to refer Bill C-241 to committee so that we can eliminate the waiting period, which is yet another measure to prevent as many people as possible from collecting benefits.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427328">Bill <Document DbId="3627221" Type="4">C-336</Document>, introduced by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128145" Type="2">Berthier—Maskinongé</Affiliation>, changes the way in which the qualifying period is calculated in the case of a labour dispute. I am thinking about the dispute that took place in Lebel-sur-Quévillon. The employer claimed that it was not a plant closure. He put off closing the plant as long as possible by locking out the employees. When he finally announced that the plant was closing, the employees had been locked out for more than 200 weeks and therefore did not qualify for employment insurance benefits. This is another serious injustice that must be corrected. We will correct it with Bill C-336, another Bloc bill that will soon be studied at second reading.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427329">Bill <Document DbId="3627125" Type="4">C-339</Document>, introduced by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128463" Type="2">Montmagny—L'Islet—Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup</Affiliation>, extends the maximum period for which special benefits for illness, injury or quarantine may be paid from 15 weeks to 50 weeks.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427330">These are the Bloc Québécois bills that are being examined and that are designed to correct what has been done to the employment insurance system in recent years. As a result of the changes that have been made, close to 60% of unemployed people are currently excluded from the employment insurance system.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427331">The employment insurance program is a measure supposed to prevent people from growing poor or even living in misery as they lose their job. However, it is not what is happening right now. In committee, with my colleagues who spoke earlier, we are studying the question of poverty. Different witnesses give us their opinions on this subject.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427332">For example, this morning, we heard the following national and pan-Canadian groups: the group for the abolition of poverty, the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, Citizens for Public Justice. These are the most important groups. They have a lot of expertise on the state of poverty. And, as far as measures to fight poverty are concerned, employment insurance is at the top on their list.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427333">Poverty exists because there are impoverishment factors, and one of the factors which makes it now more difficult to get out of poverty is the fact that close to 60% of the workers who lose their job are being excluded and are not entitled to EI benefits.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1427334">I will conclude by reminding the House that we will vote in favour of Bill <Document DbId="3627162" Type="4">C-279</Document> because delaying employment insurance because the employee is still owed some last amounts is simply unfair. </ParaText><ParaText id="1427335">I encourage my colleagues to vote in favour of Bill C-279.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I am going to touch on some specifics in a moment. </ParaText><ParaText id="1427337">However, I also want to acknowledge the good work that the member for <Affiliation DbId="128673" Type="2">Acadie—Bathurst</Affiliation> has done. Over a number of years he has been a champion for EI reform in the House. I believe in previous sessions of the House he had brought this bill forward for approval of the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427338">The member for Welland has raised a number of very good points, but I want to touch briefly on what Bill <Document DbId="3627162" Type="4">C-279</Document> actually does. It is trying to rectify an inherent unfairness in the employment insurance system. It is attempting to have the following categories no longer considered as earnings, so that when someone files a claim for employment insurance, the start of that claim is not delayed because he or she has been in receipt of a pension, superannuation, a retiring allowance, vacation pay, or severance.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427339">I am going to put it in context in terms of what is happening in our economic climate. It is important because in effect when workers receive these payments it is actually money as a result of past service. This is money that is received as a result of the years they have worked or vacation pay for the year that they worked. Really, it is retroactive.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427340">The argument when this was changed in the 1980s was that this should be considered as income arising out of employment. What that failed to take into account is that for many workers, particularly in the current economic climate, it is a buffer. It is a safety net for them.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427341">What we are hearing in many of our communities is, for workers who manage to qualify, there is no guarantee that at the end of their employment insurance claim they are actually going to have a job.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427342">I have heard from workers in Nanaimo who have talked about the fact that they are in their late 40s, or early or late 50s, they have worked all their lives in forestry, and their EI has run out. They have been sent for training as long distance truck drivers and there is simply no work for them.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427343">For those workers who actually got severance pay, that money would have been a safety net for them when their EI claims ran out. Instead, they are forced to look at having to sell their homes or go on welfare. There is not much dignity for workers who have spent their entire lives in the workforce to be forced into those kinds of circumstances.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427344">I want to touch on those circumstances. First of all, it has been mentioned in the House but I think it is worth repeating that the <Affiliation DbId="128694" Type="4">Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development</Affiliation>, on January 30, 2009, said, “We do not want to make it lucrative for them to stay home and get paid”.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427345">The member for Welland raised the point that the average weekly benefits rate now is $335 a week. That is before one pays one's tax.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427346">I do not know where the minister lives, but where I live I would challenge anyone to live on $335 a week. People have to pay rent and are lucky to get anything under $1,000 if they have a family. They have to buy groceries and might actually have to pay for clothing or education for their children. It is hardly lucrative.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427347">I have not met workers who say they would rather stay at home and collect their $335 a week than go out there and have a good-paying job.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427348">In this current economic climate, I want to speak to why these reforms for employment insurance are so important. Other members have referred to the fact that the NDP had proposed a motion that was going to see some significant changes to the Employment Insurance Act. It was going to look at reducing the number of hours to qualify, expanding the number of weeks that people could get paid, and increasing the benefit rate. All of these are very important in this economic climate.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427349">I come from a community that suffers from the recession because of what is happening in the forestry industry. A couple articles have come up and I want to reference them. </ParaText><ParaText id="1427350">Today, in the <I>Nanaimo Daily News</I>, the headline is: </ParaText><ParaText id="1427351"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Province's once-mighty forestry industry is now faltering badly. An estimated 22,000 forestry workers are off the job in B.C. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1427352">That is nearly half of all the forestry workers in British Columbia, out of roughly a 55,000-person workforce. This includes thousands in the mid-island region where my riding is. They remain idle as mills continue to close or cut back and logging operations are shut down as the ailing industry continues to struggle. Analysts see no light at the end of the tunnel.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1427353">In a report released last month PricewaterhouseCoopers reported that the nation's largest forest, paper and packaging companies hemorrhaged red ink in the last quarter of 2008 and the forestry analyst company does not paint a very rosy picture for the near future in this industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427354">We recently had a representation from the CEP, formerly Canadian Paperworkers Union, about the fact that pulp mills are in desperate straits in this country because of a loophole in a tax in the United States. They are talking about the Canadian pulp and paper industry facing mill closures and the loss of its global markets over a massive United States green energy subsidy that could provide a $6 billion taxpayer handout to American pulp producers. This could cut as much as 60% of the cost of chemical pulp in the United States. It goes on to talk about the fact that it is going to crush the pulp industry in Canada if there is not something done about that subsidy, that tax loophole in the United States.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427355">In the <I>Times Colonist</I> today there was an article that says: “Lumber industry bottoms out” and goes on to quote the president of West Fraser Timber who said he is seeing a bottom, not because markets are rebounding but because things cannot keep getting worse. Lumber prices are below the cost of production, forcing massive curtailments both here and in the U.S.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427356">In that grim background, if we do not fix the employment insurance system, we are going to see workers having to walk away from their houses and many of them will end up on welfare. We are already seeing the welfare rolls rise in many provinces including British Columbia.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427357">I want to talk about some of the companies in my riding and why severance and vacation pay are so important. These are the ones that have already collapsed. We do not know how many more are going to go down that road. We had a company called Munns Lumber which was a contract logging company based in a little community called Mesachie Lake. It is gone. It laid off all its workers. </ParaText><ParaText id="1427358">There was a company called Ted LeRoy Trucking based in Chemainus. It was a full phase logging contractor handling all of the harvesting operations that grew in response to the move by major companies to get out of the business. This is part of the transition that has been happening in British Columbia. Leroy logs primarily for Timberwest Forest. Now Leroy Logging is also gone. We have seen a company that had a very proud history of providing heavy equipment to the forestry sector, so we are not only seeing forestry companies close down and workers lose their jobs, but also the companies that supplied them. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427359">A company called Madill had 190 employees in its Nanaimo operation. That company had been in business as a heavy equipment manufacturer for the logging industry since 1911. It is gone. One of the saddest sights I have ever seen was the equipment from Leroy and Madill in a huge acreage filled with logging equipment. I drove by thinking that maybe there are some good things happening, only to realize that they were auctioning off the remains of what was once very proud forestry operations on Vancouver Island in the riding of <Affiliation DbId="128650" Type="2">Nanaimo—Cowichan</Affiliation>. This has happened all over the province of B.C. and the rest of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427360">It is absolutely essential that we make the changes to the employment insurance system to ensure that workers have the wherewithal to continue to provide livelihoods for themselves and their families. That is an important economic stimulus for our communities as well. We hear the other side talking about economic stimulus. If we want to provide economic stimulus in our local economies, we should make sure the workers have some income. They have to be able to pay their rent. They have to be able to buy food. They have to be able to pay for their kids to go to school whether it is supplies or clothing. One of the ways to make sure that economic stimulus happens at the local level is to give those workers some income. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427361">I would urge the House to look at the very sensible bill that the member for <Affiliation DbId="128407" Type="2">Welland</Affiliation> proposed. I would hope that all members in the House will support the bill, so that this is one step in that process of reforming the employment insurance system. With any kind of democratic process, we will see the government implement the NDP motion that proposed substantial reforms to EI to make sure that those workers and their communities can continue to have the kind of access to a safety net that we would all expect as reasonable Canadians.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Despite the government's high-sounding words during the election campaign, it is not open or accountable. It has retreated into secrecy, gutted the rules concerning access to information and has even stopped the long-standing practice of issuing notices of cabinet meetings.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427368">Just today, for example, the public learned how much the Conservatives paid a Republican advisor in the United States for communications advice. However, we only found out because it was part of the American law concerning disclosure. There is a lack of respect for provincial and territorial partners.

Surely, in the spirit of openness and accountability, it can provide the House, and through us, the public, with detailed information on how its equalization changes will have an impact on each province. I would also hope that the Conservatives would make it clear when and how they communicated the changes to those governments. Were they open and transparent with the finance ministers and those involved?</ParaText><ParaText id="1427374">When will the Conservative government start treating the provinces with more respect?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Answer" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Menzies" id="2726840"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128843" Type="18">Mr. Ted Menzies (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1427375">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to respond to the member's question surrounding recent changes to strengthen the equalization system. </ParaText><ParaText id="1427376">First, let me be clear. We are committed to treating all provinces equally and that is why we have restored fiscal balance through long term and fair transfer support to the provinces, as well as the territories, and why, under our Conservative government, federal support to the provinces has reached historic levels of over $54 billion and will continue to grow every year.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427377">Equalization itself has grown 56% since earlier in the decade at a pace of 15% annually and such growth was clearly unsustainable. We made changes to ensure equalization would grow in line with the economy, allowing the program to remain affordable and sustainable. </ParaText><ParaText id="1427378">We are pleased that the provinces have accepted the necessity of this action and to working co-operatively during this economic challenge. Even better, we are protecting transfer support to provinces. Health transfers will continue to grow by 6% and social transfers will continue to grow by 3%. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427379">If we contrast that with the Liberals' record on supporting provinces when they were in government, the Liberal record is clear. The Liberals radically and shamefully slashed transfer payments to provinces and territories, a record even current Liberal MPs cannot help but be highly critical of. For instance, the Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="128638" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation> stated that the Liberal government devastated health care in Canada by making draconian slashes to health care and putting health care in a crisis in every province.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427380">Our Conservative government will not follow the discredited Liberal example. We will ensure provinces and territories have the ability to provide the health care, education and other services that families need.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427381">What is more, Newfoundland is now proudly a have province, and that is a good thing, a good thing because, economically, strong provinces like Newfoundland are essential for a strong Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427382">Premier Danny Williams said that “Newfoundland and Labrador is now a have province. It's a momentous day...it means we'll probably receive less money but...we can hold our heads high and feel very good about it”. Even still, Newfoundland will still receive a projected $1.2 billion in offset payments between 2009-10 and 2011-012. That support is on top of the $2 billion in up-front payments Newfoundland retained as part of the 2005 accord and, despite no longer receiving equalization, federal support for Newfoundland remains strong; total support of $1.1 billion in 2009-10, including $372 million through health transfers and $164 million through social transfers.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427383">What is the Liberal plan for the people of Newfoundland? To quote exactly from the Liberals' own leader, he said “Federal taxes must go up.... We will have to raise taxes”. We understand that has caused great concern in Newfoundland and many are looking for more details on this Liberal plan to hike taxes.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427384">I would ask the Liberal member which taxes will be raised on Newfoundlanders, when and by how much.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Interestingly enough, by the time we had passed a year, the 2008 projections had been dropped from 220,000 tonnes to 35,000 tonnes, a dramatic reduction and, I think, clear evidence of a recognition that the program was failing.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427391">The cost for the first two years, so this is money already gone now according to the report, was $635 million. The report states that t he public transit tax credit “will have a negligible impact on Canada's greenhouse gas emissions”. </ParaText><ParaText id="1427392">We support action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but we on this side of the House certainly favour not misleading Canadians and not wasting taxpayer money.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427393">When I first asked the question, the minister's answer, or rather non-answer, was:</ParaText><ParaText id="1427394"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Mr. Speaker, we continue to work on this. We continue to focus on emissions. We continue to ensure that we achieve the environmental objectives that we have spoken about in the House. </QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText><ParaText id="1427395">In effect, a complete non-answer. Now the minister may not have heard the question or one might suspect that the answer was completely a non-answer because the minister did not actually have an answer.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427396">I will now give the parliamentary secretary the opportunity to address that. </ParaText><ParaText id="1427397">However, more specifically, despite this clear failure of the program, the program is still in effect. Therefore, I would add additional questions to the original question. Given that the government has decided to continue a program that is so completely a failure in terms of reduction of emissions, as well as costing the taxpayers a great deal of money, could he also inform us of what the projections are now in terms of greenhouse gas emission reductions and at what particular cost for this coming year?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We clearly stated that the public transit tax credit was there and that it was intended to help low income Canadian families, as well as pensioners, students and other Canadians who regularly use public transit.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427400">It was and still is the government's view that public transit eases traffic congestion and improves the environment. As we indicated in our climate change plan for the purposes of the Kyoto protocol implementation act for 2007, there are many factors that affect transit ridership, including fuel prices, parking costs and service levels. </ParaText><ParaText id="1427401">Discussions with experts indicate that there is no direct manner of capturing the greenhouse gas reductions resulting from the tax credit. The environmental impact from the program was based on estimates using the best methodology and the information that was available.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1427402">Environment Canada, Finance Canada and Transport Canada undertook a critical review of the 2007 estimate and developed a more appropriate methodology for the 2008 plan. It should be noted that the national round table on the environment and the economy, in its review of the 2007 plan, highlighted the need to revise the methodology for estimating emission reductions from the tax credit.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427403">Though the new estimate of greenhouse gas emission reductions are lower than originally thought, the results of the program have been beneficial. Greenhouse gas emission reductions are only one of the several benefits provided by the increased public transit usage. To the extent that car ridership decreases, Canadians are also exposed to fewer atmospheric pollutants, such as particulate matter.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427404">The transit tax credit, together with other initiatives undertaken by our government to support public transit, help to ensure the availability and affordability of this important service to many Canadians who cannot afford the alternatives. We continue to believe that the public transit tax credit is beneficial.</ParaText><ParaText id="1427405">Finally, I would like to note that the public transit tax credit cannot be seen as a measure working in isolation. It is part of a package of policies that are intended to move Canada in the direction of lower greenhouse gas emissions.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
