Jack Layton (Toronto—Danforth, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="602851">Mr. Speaker, as per Standing Order 52, the New Democratic Party requests that the House of Commons hold an emergency debate today on the foreign takeover of Canadian industries. The issue is of immediate importance to the national economy and the well-being of working people across Canada. We hope that you will look favourably on this request. </ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="602852">Canada is losing its economic gems. Canadian interests, whether small, medium or large, are being taken over by foreign interests. Alcan seems to be next on the list, going for $33 billion. Yesterday, Van Houtte was sold to American interests for $600 million. Such transactions may please shareholders, but all this does not bode well for Canada's economy, and thus for the families of Canadian workers. It is urgent that we have a debate here, in this House, to take up this issue of the utmost importance, I would even say of vital strategic importance, as the livelihoods of families are at stake. </ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="602853">We do not have in place the kinds of protections, the kinds of regulations and the kind of decision making that would allow us to ensure that whenever there is a foreign takeover of a Canadian business, Canadian jobs are put as a priority, that investment in the country is put as a priority. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="602854">In fact, it is to the contrary. I have visited plants where foreign takeovers have simply resulted in contracts that would otherwise have been performed by the workers in those plants who, in some cases, have been there for many years being shipped elsewhere to other companies that the multinational owns, either in the United States or far beyond across the seas where the jobs get created. Gradually industry in Canada is winding down to the point where we have a crisis of 250,000 jobs lost in our manufacturing sector.</ParaText><ParaText id="602855">At some point we have to recognize that we are in an urgent situation and that the House of Commons needs to debate the best possible ideas about how this crisis can be addressed.</ParaText><ParaText id="602856">Mr. Speaker, I hope that you will look favourably on this request for an emergency debate.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Directly or indirectly, we are all gas consumers. The vehicles we use, whether cars or buses, run on gas or petroleum products. Consumers are also affected indirectly because what we buy is often transported by truck. This is therefore an extremely important debate.</ParaText><ParaText id="602862">As was mentioned, the motion asks:</ParaText><ParaText id="602863"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That, in the opinion of the House, the government should move an amendment to the Competition Act so that the Commissioner of Competition have the power to initiate investigations of the price of gas and the role of refining margins in the determination of the said price.</QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText><ParaText id="602864">The government is fond of saying that prices at the pump are determined by market forces.</ParaText><ParaText id="602865">Mr. Speaker, before I go on, I would like to say that I will be sharing my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="78399" Type="2">Trois-Rivières</Affiliation>. I believe that you already guessed as much.</ParaText><ParaText id="602866">The government and the big oil companies have often said that the price consumers pay is determined solely by market forces, which in turn are affected by international economic factors more than anything else.</ParaText><ParaText id="602867">This is a simplistic argument. Everyone knows that international events play a role in determining gas prices at the pump, but other factors also come into play. Moreover, if countries everywhere, and especially industrialized nations, were to exercise more self-discipline in terms of supply and use, we could easily exert greater control over this factor.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="602868">It is a poor, incomplete argument that lets the government shirk its responsibility to ensure that consumers and the public get their money's worth. </ParaText><ParaText id="602869">A second thing often mentioned is taxes. It is often the industry that brings this up. I remember hearing Carol Montreuil say during an interview on TVA on May 3 that the average profit per litre was around 2¢, while the government takes close to 40¢ per litre in taxes.</ParaText><ParaText id="602870">Obviously there are a number of issues raised in the statement of Mr. Montreuil, who, I would remind the House, is a spokesperson for the Canadian Petroleum Products Institute. First, the 2¢ he is referring to probably represents the retailer's margin. This margin usually varies between 3.5¢ and 6¢ per litre.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="602871">We can see that this is not a very big part of the significant variations that have been seen in the price of gas. I doubt that this 2¢ refers to the refining margins, which are much more problematic. This is why the motion specifically identifies the role of refining margins in determining the price at the pump as a factor that could explain this variation. I will come back to this later. However, what is interesting about the role of taxes is that someone who has been closely following the evolution of the gasoline market, especially in Quebec, in the greater Montreal area, sent me the calculations he did after hearing Mr. Montreuil's comments. I want to share them because I think they bring up an interesting question. There is no answer, but the question reflects the relevance of our motion. </ParaText><ParaText id="602872">He says:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="602873"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Take the federal government, for example. There is the 10¢ excise tax and the 6% GST, which adds up to an average revenue of 16¢ per litre.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="602874">That is 16¢ per litre in federal taxes.</ParaText><ParaText id="602875"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Approximately 30 billion litres are sold in Canada, netting the federal government $4.8 billion.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="602876">That means $4.8 billion in federal gas tax revenues. I will go on.</ParaText><ParaText id="602877"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Taken together, Shell Canada and Esso recorded profits of $4.74 billion. </QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText><ParaText id="602878">That is about the same amount collected in federal gas taxes. Combined profits of $4.74 billion is exactly what the federal government brings in. He asks the following question.</ParaText><ParaText id="602879"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">How can the government amass $4.8 billion by collecting 16¢ on every litre sold in Canada—</QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="602880">He noted that Shell Canada, with its 45% share of the refining industry, refines 1.8 million barrels a day and makes just two cents per litre but generates the same amount of revenue as the federal government. Something does not add up here if the federal government makes $4.8 billion with its 16¢ per litre while the two oil companies I mentioned, Shell and Esso, who make up 45% of the refining market, make as much as the federal government two cents per litre at a time.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp><ParaText id="602881"> So they ask themselves the question. Are they in fact perhaps making more than 2¢ per litre? That is the question we are seeking to answer in our motion. We want to find ways to get answers to the questions that people are asking themselves, that we are asking ourselves—extremely legitimate questions. </ParaText><ParaText id="602882"> The major problem is that the Competition Act is not as stringent as it needs to be for the investigations that the commissioner might conduct to produce results. On the government side, they will tell us that there have been six investigations and that no one has ever been able to prove collusion. We are not saying there is collusion; we simply want the Competition Bureau to have the means to carry out these investigations, and that is what we are proposing in this motion.</ParaText><ParaText id="602883"> Obviously, this is not the only solution, nor the only partial solution, that is needed. There will be others, and I know that the member for <Affiliation DbId="78399" Type="2">Trois-Rivières</Affiliation> will be amending my motion shortly to include the petroleum monitoring agency and also to move to amend the act to decriminalize the anti-competitive pricing practices. That is, that the criminal offences attached to investigations into price-fixing—in particular, gasoline pricing, but it would apply to all prices—be eliminated, and be made civil issues instead. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="602884"> I would like to come back to the refinery margins. As I said, the retailer's margin is 3.5¢ to 6¢ per litre. We think that this margin is relatively reasonable, and it has been stable over time. On the other hand, refinery margins have risen from an average of 6¢ or 7¢, which they were from 1998 to 2003, to the present average of 26¢ per litre.</ParaText><ParaText id="602885"> How can we explain the refinery margin having risen so high, when the average in recent years, in the late 1990s and early part of this century, ranged back and forth between 6¢ and 8¢? According to the Association québécoise des indépendants du pétrole, at a 6¢ per litre profit to refineries, the oil companies are already making very attractive profits. </ParaText><ParaText id="602886"> In the current situation, the five biggest oil companies control 90% of the refining market and are making excess profits of about 20¢ a litre. That amounts to $10 for every 50-litre fill-up we get. That means that wealth is being transferred from the public, from consumers, to the oil industry, which is already heavily favoured by this government, in terms of the tax system and the environment. We will have an opportunity to come back to this. As a result, we wonder about the reason for this excessive 26¢ margin. Obviously I am talking about an average for the 2006-07 year.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="602887"> Recently, I heard Mr. Montreuil say again that in February the refinery margin was 0¢. Of course, he chose the worst month. However, based on the average, which is the indicator of the real situation, the margin is 26¢. Last year, it was about 19¢ or 20¢. So it has risen steadily. In our view, not only do we have to ask questions, but we must also be in a position to get some answers. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="602888">Obviously, refining operations are distributed regionally, as we have heard. For example, in the Montreal area, Petro-Canada and Shell do the refining. In the Quebec City area, it is Ultramar. In New Brunswick, Irving does it and in Nova Scotia, I believe it is Esso. Refining is currently experiencing an undercapacity. Is that intentional or not? These questions must be asked. Why is it that oil companies do not have any reserves and when disaster strikes, for instance, the price increases, but comes back down very little? Also, why is it that they cannot seem to plan ahead for the construction holidays, even though they always occur at the same time every year? These things can be anticipated, although, as we all know, a few days before the construction holidays or any other holiday, the price goes up.</ParaText><ParaText id="602889">The Competition Act therefore needs to be amended, first of all, to give the commissioner the authority to launch investigations, as needed. The commissioner must also be able to request that documents be submitted as evidence, which is currently not the case. The Competition Bureau needs to have real powers in order to properly complete the necessary investigations and to provide us with answers to our entirely legitimate questions.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="602890">Once again, I would like to say that we have no evidence of collusion. That is a fact. Perhaps there is no collusion at all. It would be in the best interests of the major oil companies, I think, for the Competition Act to be more rigorous in order to bring greater transparency to the situation and, by answering our questions, to dispel any doubts.</ParaText><ParaText id="602891">I therefore urge all members here in this House to vote in favour of this Bloc Québécois motion.</ParaText>

However, when the price of a barrel of oil goes down, nothing happens at the pumps.</ParaText><ParaText id="602893"> People in my riding are outraged.

One has to wonder why Canadian oil companies—and <?bk?>U.S.<?ek?> companies, too—have closed so many refineries.</ParaText><ParaText id="602904">I understand very well that they wanted to streamline operations in order to increase productivity. When supply more or less matches demand and there are extraordinary circumstances—an international event, or hurricane Katrina, or an ice storm—they do not have the necessary reserves to absorb the rise in prices and so prices skyrocket. I do not understand why the oil companies do not have these reserves that would enable them to weather the storm.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="602905">Perhaps the federal government should force them to establish such reserves—or perhaps the government should do so itself—to avoid this type of situation. One has to wonder if this is what the oil companies were hoping for. It may not necessarily be collusion but not producing enough at the refinery creates an artificial shortage or artificial pressure on prices. We must take a closer look. The purpose of the motion is to shed light on the issue and to find the means to decrease the supply-side pressure toward price increases, while ensuring the availability of gas when needed.</ParaText><ParaText id="602906">I will close by saying that heavy demand during periods such as the Easter and Christmas holidays and the construction holidays are not unpredictable. These events occur at the same time every year. How is it that prices magically increase?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Brunelle" id="2062582"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78399" Type="2">Ms. Paule Brunelle (Trois-Rivières, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="602907">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise today to speak to this motion, because the price of gas affects our entire economy, the entire population and, above all, many workers, who, in order to earn a living, must constantly contend with very high gas prices. The price is skyrocketing, the refining margin is three times too high and oil company profits are truly obscene. The price at the regular pump was $1.15, on average, last week in Quebec City, and $1.17 in Trois-Rivières on May 7. The average refining margin reached a record high at 23¢. That is three times too high, as the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78635" Type="2">Joliette</Affiliation> was saying, when we know that a profit of 5¢ to 7¢ is enough for the oil companies to earn a reasonable profit on refining.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="602908">The price of petroleum products could remain high over the summer, especially since the cost of crude oil continues to rise. Who is pocketing the profits in the end? It is the oil companies, of which there are only six major companies. There are six major oil companies in Canada, and together, they earned a record profit of nearly $12 billion in 2006, an increase of 25% over 2005. It was unbelievable, but that record profit of 2005 was 70% higher than in 2004. It is becoming apparent that the oil and gas sector really needs to be controlled. The entire economy is threatened by the increase in the cost of this very strategic resource. We in the Bloc Québécois believe it is possible, at least in part, to avoid increases in prices for gasoline and other petroleum products.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="602909"> Clearly the rising price of petroleum products has many consequences in our day-to-day lives. For example, in the case of taxis—to give just one example—they cannot change their fares every day according to the gas prices. With vacations coming up, how will our low- and middle-income families cope with this rise in the cost of gas? It increases the cost of all goods, since obviously the rise in transportation costs will be passed on to consumers through increased product prices. In my riding, the Kruger company, in an industry that is already in trouble, will have more problems transporting its wood chips. We think of our truck drivers, whose incomes are constantly dropping. They will have to put in longer hours to make ends meet, and that will lead to higher risks of accidents. Their profits are already very low and they will have something to say about this to the members of this House.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="602910"> And certainly the increases in the price of gasoline are very harmful to the government, which itself is a very large consumer of gas. </ParaText><ParaText id="602911"> Four main factors explain this rise: the price of crude oil, of course; the refining margin; taxes; and the retail margin.</ParaText><ParaText id="602912"> When we talk about the retail margin, this is the difference between the price paid by retailers to buy their gas and the price they sell it for. Taxes, even though we often find them high, barely fluctuate and in our opinion do not explain the variations in the price of gas since most of these taxes are fixed. Certainly the price of crude oil is set internationally. It is hard to do anything to control this price, but there remain certain factors on which we can have an influence. While supply can still meet demand, it nevertheless has an effect on the rise in prices. Increasingly we see that oil prices are negotiated on the stock market. They are very sensitive to speculation, like any other commodity.</ParaText><ParaText id="602913"> Professor Antoine Ayoub was talking in this connection about the new players, that is the pension funds, that have got into the oil speculation market and that have more influence on the market. We see that, by basing themselves on a number of uncertainties, which my colleague from Joliette talked about, such as the Iraq invasion and the resumption of Iraqi exports, which are always threatening to become problematic, they manage to make the price rise artificially by about US$15 per barrel. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp><ParaText id="602914">This brings us to the key point of this motion, which has to do with refining.</ParaText><ParaText id="602915">In North America, companies have significantly streamlined refining activities since 1990. Obviously, to cut costs, they have closed a number of refineries, thus increasing use of their production capacity.</ParaText><ParaText id="602916">The gap between supply and demand has narrowed, with the result that the smallest climatic or technical problem upsets the balance between these two factors and leads to an increase in prices. The smallest increase in demand for gas sends prices up, as we can see on long weekends and holidays, as though refineries had no way of anticipating this. Why could they not have built up reserves? Any businessperson knows that during peak times, there should be a little more merchandise to sell, to be sure to meet the needs of customers. This remains very hard to understand.</ParaText><ParaText id="602917">If the government had not stubbornly refused to follow up on the recommendation to create a petroleum monitoring agency, it would have been better able to understand the market and see the crisis coming. We think a petroleum monitoring agency could prevent this situation by sounding the alarm, and propose solutions.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="602918">The Bloc Québécois is suggesting that the Competition Act be given more teeth to examine the role of refining margins in the determination of prices. A reasonable refining margin is in the range of 4¢ to 7¢ per litre, as mentioned earlier. In March and April it was more than 15¢ per litre. Last week, it was about 23¢ per litre, four times the reasonable margin. The industry must be disciplined, the Competition Act must be strengthened, the Competition Bureau must be able to investigate and must have real powers of investigation, which it does not have right now, and a petroleum monitoring agency should be established.</ParaText><ParaText id="602919">Furthermore, this was a recommendation made by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology in November 2003.

She is, of course, giving me the opportunity to talk about an issue that I care about, namely the environment. Obviously, we have to try to reduce our dependency on oil. In order to do so, any measure that would provide more energy efficient vehicles would be welcome. We know that some technological advances have been made in Quebec regarding the electric vehicle. So, if there was less pressure from the automobile industry, we could use this type of vehicles. That would solve part of the problem. It would be one option. </ParaText><ParaText id="602932">The issue is particularly problematic in Quebec, because we must import all of our oil. Therefore, it is really important to rely on alternative energies and reduce our energy consumption.

In this regard, the Conservative government is definitely showing a lot of flaws and no real political will. </ParaText><ParaText id="602933">However, one thing that we notice and that is encouraging is that the public is developing what could be called a “green” attitude.

Both as a member of Parliament and as a consumer, I too share their concerns about high prices, whether for gasoline or any other product.</ParaText><ParaText id="602944">I certainly understand the impact of high gasoline prices on individuals and businesses, particularly small businesses. No one wants to pay any more than they have to for anything. </ParaText><ParaText id="602945">The matter we have before us today, however, is whether the proposal put forward by the Bloc is appropriate.</ParaText><ParaText id="602946">I understand the reaction of Canadian consumers to recent price increases. They are frustrated and they are angry. They are looking to the government to do something to stop the increases in gasoline prices. The frustration goes even further when average Canadians hear of a petroleum company's announcement of record profits.</ParaText><ParaText id="602947">However, gasoline prices are a complex issue. Many different factors come into play in determining the price Canadian consumers pay at the pump. Some of these factors are international, national, regional and even local in nature. As we have seen the last couple of years, events halfway around the world can impact the price of gasoline right here in Canada. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="602948">The question we have to ask is whether the Bloc's motion will actually accomplish anything. I submit that it would not. </ParaText><ParaText id="602949">In the Canadian economy businesses are generally free to set their own prices, dictated by market forces. Sometimes prices go up; sometimes they go down. The setting of prices is dictated by the market forces of supply and demand. For example, rising prices are often an indication of low inventory.</ParaText><ParaText id="602950">The Bloc's motion seeks to amend the Competition Act to give the Competition Bureau the power to initiate investigations into the price of gas. The Competition Bureau has already investigated the price of gas numerous times since 1990. While I know some of this has already been discussed, I believe the following bears repeating.</ParaText><ParaText id="602951">The Competition Act ensures that Canada has a competitive marketplace and that all Canadians enjoy the benefits of competitive prices and product choices, including a convenient and ample supply of quality products that respond to consumers' preferences.</ParaText><ParaText id="602952">When it comes to high prices, the Competition Bureau will be concerned only when they are the result of anti-competitive conduct contrary to the Competition Act.</ParaText><ParaText id="602953">The Competition Act includes provisions against price fixing, price maintenance, and abusive behaviour by a dominant firm resulting in the lessening of competition. The act applies to gasoline and other petroleum product markets as well as every other sector in the Canadian economy.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="602954">Pursuant to the Competition Act, if the Commissioner of Competition has reason to believe that an offence has been committed or that a company has abused its dominant position in a market, the commissioner can either refer matters for prosecution or seek a remedial order by the Competition Tribunal respectively.</ParaText><ParaText id="602955">Over the years the Competition Bureau has been very active in matters relating to gasoline and other petroleum products, including prosecution and merger reviews. In addition, the bureau has commissioned expert reports on an array of issues related to the sector. Documents related to these activities are available on the bureau's website. I would encourage all hon. members to go to the bureau's website and see for themselves.</ParaText><ParaText id="602956">When examinations of the petroleum industry yielded evidence of conduct contrary to the act, the bureau has initiated enforcement action. Since 1972, 13 inquiries relating to gasoline or heating oil prices have led to trials. Eight of these cases concluded with convictions.</ParaText><ParaText id="602957">Since 1990 the Competition Bureau has conducted six major investigations related to the gasoline industry. In each case it found no evidence to suggest that periodic price increases resulted from a national conspiracy to limit competition in gasoline supply or from abusive behaviour by dominant firms in the market. Instead, market forces such as supply and demand, and rising crude oil prices were found to have caused the price increases.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="602958">Last year the Competition Bureau concluded its examination of high gasoline prices following hurricane Katrina. The bureau found no evidence of a national conspiracy to fix gasoline prices. The dramatic reduction in supply resulting from severe damage to the North American refining capacity caused the spike in gasoline prices.</ParaText><ParaText id="602959">It is also important to mention that the Competition Bureau monitors gasoline prices to ensure that they are the result of market forces and not the result of anti-competitive acts which would be contrary to the act.</ParaText><ParaText id="602960">Gasoline prices across Canada have risen lately due to increases in the world price of crude oil, the major cost component in a litre of gasoline, as well as low inventories. Nothing in what I have just reviewed indicates that there is any need to amend the Competition Act.</ParaText><ParaText id="602961"> In considering this motion, I urge all hon. members to recall that the Competition Bureau exists to promote and maintain competition in all sectors of the economy, including the petroleum industry by educating businesses and consumers, promoting compliance with the Competition Act and taking enforcement action when necessary.</ParaText><ParaText id="602962">In conclusion, increases in gasoline prices resulting from anti-competitive behaviour are already dealt with through existing provisions in the Competition Act.

It is simple. There is competition in the gas sector. Six big companies are constantly getting richer, and the prices rise at the same time, at the same intersection, in the same way, quite by chance. In Montreal, there are four companies at the same intersection. It is curious. Between 10 o’clock and 10:15, the prices all go up at the same time by the same amount. And they tell us there is competition. When certain products are on special at Provigo, they are not necessarily on special at Métro, because there is real competition. At a given time, the price of other items falls. That is how it works. </ParaText><ParaText id="602964"> The gas companies tell us —and this is what my question will be about— that if the price of gas goes up, it is because things are not going well in the world. It is strange that things never go well around the Saint-Jean-Baptiste holiday, just before Christmas holidays and just before the start of summer vacation, the construction holidays. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="602965"> If there is no need for closer monitoring of the gas companies in terms of competition, how does he explain that when the world price of crude increases and the price of a litre of gas should go up by 2¢, 3¢ or 4¢, it goes up by 20¢, 25¢ or 30¢? Why do events in the Middle East influence the profit margins of Shell, Exxon, Imperial, etc., here in Canada? The fact is that the world price of crude is only a pretext. We need a monitoring agency. I ask the member why he does not see the need for one. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Just a couple of months ago, the Liberals were praising a $100 billion carbon tax, which again would have increased the price of gasoline.</ParaText><ParaText id="602986">Then there is the Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="78329" Type="2">Ajax—Pickering</Affiliation> who was quoted in the September 11, 2005, <I>Toronto Star</I> as having said, “A lot of analysts say gas at $1.50 a litre is well within sight”. Then there are the Bloc members who have signed on to supporting the Liberal carbon tax plan, Bill <Document DbId="2181701" Type="4">C-288</Document>. </ParaText><ParaText id="602987">The costs of this so-called environmental plan were independently analyzed by some of Canada's leading economists and experts, people like Don Drummond and Mark Jaccard. Don Drummond was a former senior public servant under the previous Liberal government and is now a vice-president of the TD Bank and Mark Jaccard is another well-respected expert on environmental issues. What did they find? They found that under the Liberal plan, backed by their buddies in the Bloc, Canadians stand to lose 275,000 jobs. That is terrible. Also, under the Liberal plan, the price of gasoline would increase a whopping 60%.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="602988">I am from the Vancouver area, the riding of Langley, and the price out there right now is $1.269. If we add 60% on to that, it is over $1.90 a litre. That is what the Liberals want and that is what the Bloc wants. I guess that $1.50 a litre predicted by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78329" Type="2">Ajax—Pickering</Affiliation> just was not enough tax on the backs of Canadians and families and businesses. That plan from the Liberals and the Bloc does not get it done on the environment or the economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="602989">Let us talk about the actions that our government is taking, not only to improve the environment but also the economy. For example, our government is taking a number of actions to reduce pollution from the transportation sector. These actions would not only reduce our greenhouse emissions but would also have economic benefits for Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="602990">The government is also assisting small communities and large cities by investing $33 billion in infrastructure, including public transit. The tax credit for public transit passes, first introduced in budget 2006, is being extended to initiate fare products, such as electronic fare cards and weekly passes. </ParaText><ParaText id="602991">All these resources are designed with one goal in mind; and that is, to help Canadians make better and more environmentally responsible decisions. </ParaText><ParaText id="602992">Renewable fuels are cleaner fuels that reduce air pollution and lower greenhouse gas emissions. The government recently announced its intention to develop a regulation requiring a 5% average renewable content by volume, such as ethanol, a Canadian gasoline, by 2010. Renewable fuel production is a new market opportunity for farmers and the rural communities. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="00">(1100)</Timestamp><ParaText id="602993">Budget 2006 included $365 million to assist farmers in realizing opportunities through agricultural bioproducts, including renewable fuels. To meet the requirements of the proposed regulations, over 2 billion litres of renewable fuel will be required, creating tremendous business opportunities for Canadian renewable fuel and agriculture producers.</ParaText><ParaText id="602994">Budget 2007 invests up to $2 billion in support of renewable fuel production in Canada to help meet those requirements, including up to $1.5 billion for an operating incentive, and $500 million for next generation renewable fuels. </ParaText><ParaText id="602995">Support under the program to individual companies will be capped to ensure that the benefits are provided to a wide range of participants in the sector, not just the large oil producing companies. That is fair.</ParaText><ParaText id="602996">Budget 2007 also makes $500 million over seven years available to Sustainable Development Technology Canada to invest in the private sector in establishing large scale facilities for the production of next generation renewable fuels. Next generation renewable fuels produced from agricultural and wood waste products, such as wheat straw, cornstalk, wood residue and switchgrass, have the potential to generate even greater environmental benefits than the traditional renewable fuels.</ParaText><ParaText id="602997">Canada is well positioned to become a world leader in the development and commercialization of next generation fuels. For example, the Ottawa based Iogen is one of Canada's leading biotechnology firms. It operates the world's only demonstration scale facility to convert biomass to cellulose ethanol using enzyme technology. I encourage a visit to that wonderful facility.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="602998">Transportation is one of the largest sources of air pollution and greenhouse gases in Canada. Cars, trucks, trains and planes all add to air pollution and they account for over one-quarter of all greenhouse gases and air pollutant emissions in Canada. For the first time, the Government of Canada will regulate cars and light trucks to ensure they use fuel more efficiently. Our standard will be based on a stringent North American standard. We will work hard with the United States to pursue a clean auto pact that will create an environmentally ambitious North American standard for cars and light duty trucks.</ParaText><ParaText id="602999">We will make air pollution rules for vehicles and engines that are sources of smog, like motorcycles, personal watercraft, snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles, and align them with world leading standards. We will also continue to take action to reduce emissions from the rail, marine and aviation sectors and we will work with our U.S. neighbours to administer these regulations as efficiently as possible.</ParaText><ParaText id="603000">Those are all great things that the government is doing to balance the environment and the economy. Unlike the Bloc members, who have done absolutely nothing but complain in this place for years and have nothing to show for it, it is this government that is getting it done for Canadians and the environment.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I want to commend him for his expertise on this file and his commitment to fairer and more transparent gas pricing and better value for Canadian consumers. He has worked diligently on this for a number of years and I think he would be, within the House of Commons, the leading expert on this file. I think members from all parties listen intently to him when he speaks to this issue and we look forward to hearing from him in a few minutes.</ParaText><ParaText id="603021">We support any measures that will lead to greater transparency in gas pricing. The motion proposes to strengthen the Competition Act to allow for investigations into gas prices, specifically their relationship to the refining margin and corporate profits.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603022">The fact is that back in October 2004, the Liberal government tabled Bill C-19, which included amendments to the Competition Act. The proposed changes would have strengthened Canada's competition framework to the benefit of both consumers and businesses. The amendments would have benefited consumers by providing authority for the Commissioner of Competition to seek restitution for consumer loss resulting from false or misleading representations. The bill introduced a general administrative monetary penalty provision for abuse of dominance in any industry. It would have removed the airline specific provision from the act to return it to a law of general application, increased the level of administrative monitoring penalties for deceptive marketing practices and, most important, decriminalized the pricing provisions such that the Competition Bureau could act more effectively.</ParaText><ParaText id="603023">Beyond that, in October 2004 the previous Liberal government went significantly further to ensure better pricing for Canadian consumers. We introduced a plan that would address both short term and long term measures to help Canadians deal with higher energy costs and that would provide direct financial assistance and energy cost benefits to more than three million low income seniors and low income families with children. We introduced the EnerGuide program to help families lower their future household heating costs. Our plan made more and better pricing information available to consumers while taking legislative steps, as I described earlier, to deter anti-competitive practices. The plan fast-tracked money from municipalities for public transit.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603024">The Liberal government took a comprehensive approach to provide timely short term relief but also helped lay out the groundwork for meaningful and long term benefits through greater efficiency and conservation. What we proposed was not only good for the environment in terms of reducing consumption but also good for Canadian consumers by reducing their monthly costs. Our proposals would help make homes and buildings more energy efficient as a key measure for helping Canadians offset higher pricing for energy and to reduce their costs.</ParaText><ParaText id="603025">Incentives that were provided would have helped Canadians save energy and money and reduce greenhouse gas emissions that were contributing and contribute to climate change. They were part of project green, the Government of Canada's action plan to help build a more sustainable environment.</ParaText><ParaText id="603026">In fact, all the measures we provided, whether it was the energy cost benefit of $565 million to be paid out to 3.1 million low income families and seniors to help them address higher energy costs, or the changes to the Competition Act through Bill C-19, would have made a significant difference in terms of reducing the disproportionate impact of higher energy costs on all things but particularly on low income Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="603027">We invested $800 million over a period of two years in public transit infrastructure. We also provided greater transparency in the pricing and competition oversight model.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603028">In November 2005, Bill C-66, the Energy Costs Assistance Measures Act, further strengthened transparency in the energy market with a $15 million investment in the Office of Energy Price Information to monitor energy price fluctuations and to provide clear ongoing information to Canadians. We provided another $13 million to allow the Department of Industry to take further steps to deter anti-competitive practices, including strengthening the Competition Bureau and the Competition Act.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp><ParaText id="603029">The fact is that what is proposed in this motion by our colleagues in the Bloc was actually done by the previous Liberal government, both in terms of strengthening the Competition Act, and improving the degree to which the government can act to reduce anti-competitive policies, and by helping all Canadian consumers, but particularly low income Canadian consumers, to reduce their energy costs and to deal with higher energy costs and at the same time reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</ParaText><ParaText id="603030">In fact, the Liberal government was doing this. The Bloc helped defeat that government. It helped to elect and continues to support a Conservative government that has actually reduced and eliminated most of these programs that were benefiting Canadian consumers, reducing their energy costs and at the same time protecting the environment. </ParaText><ParaText id="603031">When we were actually strengthening the Competition Act such that the Competition Bureau would have the ability to act when it needed to, the current government, as we have heard from the <Affiliation DbId="78953" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry</Affiliation>, does not see this as being necessary and believes that the Competition Act and the Competition Bureau are functioning exactly as they ought to. He does not see any need for changes.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603032">We saw the need for changes. In fact, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78981" Type="2">Pickering—Scarborough East</Affiliation> helped lead the charge. The member helped us develop and build the case and the policy prescriptives required to strengthen the Competition Act and the ability of the Competition Bureau to act. It was that Liberal member who actually helped our Liberal government develop the policies to make this happen, but it is the Conservative government that refuses to act.</ParaText><ParaText id="603033">Respectfully I say to my colleagues in the Bloc that I support this motion, but our government had done this. It was the support of the Bloc to defeat that government and to elect and support the Conservative government that actually denied Canadians the opportunity to have more transparent pricing for gasoline for consumers and, at the same time, to have important measures that can reduce consumption and protect the environment.</ParaText><ParaText id="603034">I think it is important that we work together as parliamentarians, particularly in a day and age when minority parliaments seem to be more the habit than the exception, on areas where there is a common interest and that we do not simply reduce our deliberations to narrow partisanship. When there are policies of each other's that we can support, when we are in government or in opposition, I think we have to take our partisan blinders off from time to time and work together to advance policies.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603035">Once again, I am saying that it was the Liberal government in October of 2004 and through to November of 2005 that had introduced policies which would have accomplished exactly what the Bloc seeks to accomplish in the motion today. We support this motion because we do believe that it is the right direction, but it is important to recognize that we actually had done this as a government in terms of introducing the policies to the House of Commons to move forward with this. </ParaText><ParaText id="603036">I would hope that when we return to Liberal government the Bloc will support these initiatives as we move forward to build a more competitive, more open, fairer and more transparent regulatory structure around gas pricing, but also to build a cleaner, greener environment by helping Canadians reduce their energy needs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the same time.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="603058">I would like first to thank those who moved this motion. It must be noted that this motion, which we heard yesterday, would simply allow the commissioner to conduct a review and to initiate investigations.</ParaText><ParaText id="603059">It must also be noted that he already has this power for civil law issues. However, in cases related to criminal law, the commissioner does not have that right, except for a group of six people or as a result of a departmental directive. </ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="603060">Therefore, what the Bloc has proposed would not have worked necessarily. It is, in part, already there.</ParaText><ParaText id="603061">What makes the motion acceptable from my party's perspective is the fact that it includes two very important provisions, which my party has worked on for almost ten years now, both in turning the pricing provisions of price discrimination and predatory pricing where they belong, under civil opprobrium as opposed criminal sanction.</ParaText><ParaText id="603062">I think hon. members in the House should be aware of the fact that where there are criminal sanctions, whether that be in price discrimination, predatory pricing, conspiracy or collusion, and I alluded a little earlier to the member for <Affiliation DbId="78695" Type="2">Oshawa</Affiliation>, who is the parliamentary secretary, is it any wonder that over the years egregious examples of conspiracy, particularly in this industry, have never been proven. </ParaText><ParaText id="603063">I know most of us in this chamber have read section 45 of the Act, which deals with conspiracy. To get a conviction, one has to prove the tests of undueness. In every section undueness basically serves as a tremendous barrier of proof. One has to prove intent. One has to prove that the damage to the economy is so substantial or that the dominants are so substantial that it would bring about basically the failure of the Canadian economy. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603064">I have said this tongue in cheek before, but the only way we would get a conviction in the oil industry, for instance, would be to have the chairman of Imperial Oil swear an affidavit before the Supreme Court of Canada that it was engaging in conspiracy. This is clearly not the case.</ParaText><ParaText id="603065">In your time here as a member of Parliament, Mr. Speaker, you have seen the number of refineries go from 44 down to 14 or 13 even. In fact, in Toronto region, we have absolutely no refineries left.</ParaText><ParaText id="603066">I heard the hon. parliamentary secretary talk about ample supply. I do not know where the parliamentary secretary for industry was, but for a month and a half Canadians paid on average 8¢ a litre more because of a refinery out at Nanticoke.</ParaText><ParaText id="603067">We are running our supply situation at such a fragile point today that we are experiencing difficulties which are having tremendous impacts on not only ordinary Canadian consumers, but also on the economy in general. Our interest rates did not go down this month. We would have expected that to happen, but it did not because of the cost of gasoline, which is artificially high in Canada. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603068">It is clear to me, and I think to everyone here, that the way in which we wound up from so many players down to so few players was a combination of two factors: first, the creation of PetroCan years ago shut down a number of potential players in which independents could provide supply; and second, was stopping that policy, reversing it, throwing it back into the private sector only to have further mergers, such as the one we saw with Texaco having its assets taken up by Imperial Oil, Gulf and so on.</ParaText><ParaText id="603069">What this points to is a very dangerous oligopoly in the downstream, that is to say in the provision, the refining of product. That has happened under the watchful eye of a Competition Act, which I have tried to change several times.</ParaText><ParaText id="603070">The Competition Act, written in 1986 and which Peter C. Newman referred to as the only time in Canadian history when an act was written by the very people it was meant to police, has now seen an unfortunate outcome, but a very predictable one. It definitely needs amendment. That is one of the reasons I agree with the Bloc's motion. It agrees with what we have been trying to do for ten years.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603071">A handful of players not only control the price, but they can also control supply and also control, to a large extent, the pump price we pay from region to region within one-tenth of a cent a litre.</ParaText><ParaText id="603072">I will give an illustration of this. Last week we heard that the price of crude had come down, but that refining costs had gone up. I had no problems with understanding the arguments. Even if I were to accept those, I would have to continue to ask myself why all last week throughout Canada Canadian consumers paid on average 5¢ to 6¢ a litre wholesale more than the United States. At the same time our hard-pressed refineries, under the previous agreements to share product with the United States, FTA, NAFTA, were selling gasoline 6¢ cheaper to the United States than they were receiving in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="603073">Those are the so-called mystery cents. Those are the facts that underlie and underscore the need to amend the Competition Act. It was not this member of Parliament, who was slightly before his own time. It was not the Liberal Party that sort of invented these things. The facts remain that the public policy forum, the Competition Bureau itself, among all the changes that need to take place, came up with three under formerly Bill C-19. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603074">One was the general application for airlines. I will discuss that in just a moment. The second was turning pricing provisions from criminal to civil. The third one was about the need for an independent monitoring watchdog. Why do we need that? Simply put, Natural Resources Canada, which is the be all and end all in terms of pricing, relies on some companies like M.J. Ervin and Associates. Mr. Ervin is a great man. I met him before, but the companies he serves are in fact the oil industry. We have the proverbial fox monitoring the chicken coup. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp><ParaText id="603075">I do not speak so disparagingly of a company trying to make business. I just do not believe it is fair for a country that has seen its consumers invest so heavily over the years in terms of providing energy self-sufficiency and building these refineries with taxpayer money to see these things suddenly decline and see prices in Canada, a nation blessed with an abundance of technology, of resources and ability, suddenly paying more than the United States when there is a crisis.</ParaText><ParaText id="603076">We talked about Hurricane Katrina. No wonder the Competition Bureau cannot find anti-competitive act if it hit it on the head. For seven, to nine, to ten weeks during that period of time, we were paying 10¢ a litre more in Canada than the United States, where the problem existed. I have no difficulty in telling people that we should be paying international prices for crude and for gasoline, but, for goodness sakes, 10¢ a litre more? Are we crazy?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603077">The bureau thought so little of that and said that it did not matter that we paid the 10¢ because it found no question of anti-competitive behaviour. What it did not say is that it could not find the anti-competitive behaviour that allowed a handful of companies to charge those kind of prices, which would not be acceptable in any other industry across the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="603078">I have had many discussions on this. We have worked on this over the years. We know what the solutions are. The Bloc motion simply crystallizes the very minimum, with which even I think some members in the industry agree. However, in the public, people like Wanda Hollis in Hamilton, Ontario, are leading the gas boycott. There is a perception, a belief, that what they are doing is stopping the companies from taking advantage of consumers. I wish great power to them to do that, but until we get the Competition Act correct, we will wind up with investigations that are predictably useless and predictably unnecessary.</ParaText><ParaText id="603079">I am getting tired of hearing from the media and others, who do not want to look at this, say that we will constantly wind up in the same pickle we are in. We will have an inquiry, but we will not find conspiracy.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603080">Let it be perfectly clear. The Liberal Party and the industry critic, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78821" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation>, do not believe that conspiracy needs to exist in an environment where we have regional to regional monopolies, in which Imperial Oil in Toronto sets the price. The wholesale price for gasoline at 4 o'clock in Toronto was 66.7¢ a litre, down from 67.8¢ the day before. The other three major companies simply followed that same price. </ParaText><ParaText id="603081">There is no incentive to break that monopoly. In fact, that price is 3¢ a litre above wholesale prices for the same gasoline we sell to the United States. We are only doing it to ourselves. We need a transparent, objective body to look at these prices and say whether consumers are getting a fair break or not. It is very simple to do.</ParaText><ParaText id="603082">Platts, Bloomberg Oil Buyer's Guide knows what the Canadian dollar is exchanged for every day and looks at the wholesale prices of gas in the United in the New York market, for example. We have a fair idea about what we are talking.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603083">On that price, yesterday at the wholesale, it cost 3¢ to 4¢ a litre for a refiner to turn crude into gasoline. In fact, yesterday the mark-up was about 21¢ a litre, which is never explained anywhere. The media also has to help us here too. I do not want to hear what the price of crude is. I do not put crude in my gas tank, but I do put gasoline in that tank. I want to know what the price is, whether that is ethanol or a new product that comes out.</ParaText><ParaText id="603084">The reality is the blueprint of the Competition Act. It was written in a way that is deliberately flawed, which enhances monopolies, which has destroyed a lot of the ability for us to have competitive pricing in Canada. Parliament must act decisively and quickly with no more name calling or pointing fingers saying “they should have” or “they should not have”. Let us deal with the specifics.</ParaText><ParaText id="603085">Today Canadians are being ripped off. They deserve an answer and they deserve a decisive response by the government and Parliament. I am prepared to support any initiative that goes in that direction.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The abuse provision is a completely separate section dealing with monopolization. I am glad I am able to clarify that.</ParaText><ParaText id="603087">I am curious to know where the member is getting his actual prices. He has said that we are paying a lot more in Canada. If we look at the retail price in Canada, excluding taxes, on April 17, we were 2¢ less than in the States. The same goes for a week later when we were less. In this past week we were up a little, but consistently we are very competitive.</ParaText><ParaText id="603088">Today's debate is basically about the gas prices.

Perhaps he would like to stop wordsmithing and understand the act. Maybe if he would read it, he would understand what he was saying, rather than asking questions that make no sense. </ParaText><ParaText id="603090">We have looked at all aspects of the criminal provisions in cases of conspiracy. It is very clear some are egregious and we should leave them criminal and some we ought to make civil. However, we have to find a better balance.</ParaText><ParaText id="603091">The member of Parliament is saying that the Competition Act works fine because we have had six inquiries, in which there is obvious need for change, as demonstrated by the bureau back in 2002.

However, the reality for all of us is that the act no longer functions for the purpose in which it was intended.</ParaText>

His constituents know that because I get a lot of calls from them and a lot of them have been hurt by the practices of this industry. We are in fact paying 3¢ more in taxes, on average 6¢ more, and the oil industry will recognize that. </ParaText><ParaText id="603093">Take the CPPI. It will say we have to pay more in Canada because it is worried about the Americans buying our gasoline products. Therefore, it is okay to charge Canadians an extra 20¢ a gallon. Rather than the hon. member asking cute questions, he should be focusing on how to protect his constituents and ensuring that small independents get a fair crack.</ParaText><ParaText id="603094">As to the question on the future, I thought I made it clear three times. Gasoline prices are the reflection of an act of a document that no longer works to serve the interests of Canadians.

The member and his Conservative colleagues from the province of Ontario would agree with me. I am not interested in putting these people in jail. I am interested in stopping their practice of putting small independents out of business and continuing to shut down refineries and important critical strategic facilities, thus allowing them to raise prices in a hair trigger-fashion the moment there is talk of some disruption around the world.</ParaText><ParaText id="603101">We are more vulnerable in Canada than other places, as I explained, such as Katrina and so many other instances. Even today the wholesale price of gasoline is higher in Canada than the United States. When we strip away the same gasoline, we strip away the taxes.</ParaText>

I want to make it clear for the member. When the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> ran in 2004, he said he would drop the GST after 85¢ a litre.

It is something I brought forth to the Bloc, with regard to having a watchdog agency, something which has been around since 1999, then reintroduced in 2003, the concept specifically through an industry committee report, a committee in which I participated.</ParaText><ParaText id="603105">This is very important. What we are talking about here is not necessarily the price of gasoline. It is about public policy and whether or not we should have public policy involved in this industry to some degree. That is something that is not foreign to this country nor to the United States and other countries abroad. There is some form of public policy that either protects consumers or works to advance the industry and protects consumers.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603106">In Canada there are four provinces that have monitoring agencies that regulate the price of gasoline. They have decided to look for more stable markets in order that they do not have the wild fluctuations in prices. They would prefer as consumers to have some stability. Nothing is more frustrating to people than having to fill their gas tanks on the way to work and finding out that the price of gasoline has suddenly gone up 5% or 10%. There is nothing they can do about it. That type of speculation in that environment is something people want to have addressed to a certain capacity. That is why four provinces have chosen a model that includes public policy for that. </ParaText><ParaText id="603107">It is also not foreign to this debate here in the House of Commons. It is not even foreign to the federal government. The minister's own briefing book, of which I have a copy here, talks about the Competition Act and the challenges the Competition Bureau faces. The <Affiliation DbId="78770" Type="4">Minister of Industry </Affiliation> received secret advice, something I have acquired through the Access to Information Act, that basically outlines the Competition Act and some of the challenges.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603108">The government spokespeople today have been saying that there is nothing wrong with this, but that is not what the minister's advice has been. The minister's advice quite clearly identifies that the act is based upon an analysis done in 1969.</ParaText><ParaText id="603109">I asked a question in the House of Commons the other day. I noted that the Woodstock festival took place back in 1969. The Competition Act comes from an era of about 40 years ago which created the body and the logic and the analysis all based upon that. There have been some changes to the Competition Act since that time, but there are still problems with it. That has been identified in the advice to the minister and his own briefing book.</ParaText><ParaText id="603110">It talks about the fact that there could be a leadership role to protect consumers if it was in their interest to do so. It also says there should be a pursuit of legislative initiatives related to identity theft, as well as other issues that consumers are raising. It also talked about the global economy and the bureau not having the proper resources to do the job.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603111">That is the advice the minister was given over a year ago. He was told that the bureau does not have enough money, that the world is changing and that the bureau does not have the resources to pursue what it should be pursuing for consumers. It goes on in terms of noting some of the problems it faces and some of the things that can be changed. It is important that public policy be involved.</ParaText><ParaText id="603112">Mr. Speaker, before I go on to the next section, I would like to advise you that I will be splitting my time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="78675" Type="2">London—Fanshawe</Affiliation>. I appreciate the pages who were so helpful in that matter with props. It looked like an old Bob Dylan commercial when they had the signs out there for me.</ParaText><ParaText id="603113">I want to return to this debate and public policy. The United States has what is called the petroleum reserve. The Americans have an agency that is dedicated toward preserving a certain number of barrels of oil for the actual market and for strategic reserves. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603114">It is important to note that in 2006, the Americans put in money into the oil reserve, around $18.6 billion, to ensure that it functions properly for national security. President Bush has drawn on that to try to lower the price of gasoline. He has used that as an instrument to lower gasoline prices, something that has happened a number of times in recent years. He also rolled out a public policy for that.</ParaText><ParaText id="603115">The New Democratic Party has been calling for some form of public policy. That is why we believe the petroleum monitoring agency is the first step we could take to make sure there is accountability for consumers.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp><ParaText id="603116">This industry has billions of dollars in profits. Recently the quarterly amounts came out with Imperial Oil at $774 million, Petro-Canada at $560 million and EnCana at $497 million. </ParaText><ParaText id="603117">We are asking whether or not Canadians are paying a fair price at the pump. A petroleum monitoring agency gives the independent analysis and voice that is necessary. MJ Ervin &amp; Associates accumulates the data and basically is the voice for the industry. I am not here to say that it does a bad job, but I can say it has a different perspective in terms of analyzing the data, reporting it to the public and rolling out new initiatives on accounting for that. It is different from having an actual agency that does that. That was something we agreed to in 2003. The industry, science and technology committee almost had unanimous support for such an agency. To this date we have not seen that come forward. That is why we would like to see that part of the proponent brought forth.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603118">It has been interesting that when we look at the high commodity prices that we have right now, people automatically assume we are going to see the higher price of gasoline and a reduction in use. That has not been the case in Canada. The most recent information from Statistics Canada is when it did a yearly review in 2006. It talked about retail gasoline consumption. It noted that with the price of gasoline going up “the only concession drivers made to higher prices was to switch from premium to regular grade gasoline in each year”.</ParaText><ParaText id="603119">Consumers have decided that they cannot afford some of the higher prices. That is why we have been talking about the prosperity gap in Canada. Ordinary citizens are watching their wallets being squeezed day in and day out, but at the same time they have not seen their income rise to levels that are appropriate for their daily needs.</ParaText><ParaText id="603120">We are supportive of reducing the dependency on gasoline as a product. It is a very important part of our public policy. For example, for a number of years I have been pushing for a green car strategy. At the same time we know there is a public vacuum and that with the increase in gasoline prices, consumers are going to abandon products that are cleaner and greener. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603121">If we put them on the market but we over price them and allow the profit margin to continue to expand exponentially without questioning it, people will make choices that probably will not be very good. We will continue to have the growth of gasoline products at the lower end of the spectrum in emission standards and quality, at the expense of some of the higher brands, the ones we want to promote to citizens because they are cleaner and greener technologies. There cannot be this vacuum. </ParaText><ParaText id="603122">The member for <Affiliation DbId="78329" Type="2">Ajax—Pickering</Affiliation> noted that the inflation rate is going up significantly. The consumer price index right now is skyrocketing. Consumers paid 2.3% more in March for their goods and services in the most recent data that is available. It was largely due to a strong increase in gasoline prices throughout the country. What ends up happening is that with the rise in inflation rates, people abandon the cleaner technologies that are available.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603123">What is important in this motion is to create the needed elements for gas pricing that is going to be based around the Competition Bureau, making sure the refining margins are part of the public policy debate. The refining margins are very important. We have seen literally the dissolution of them over a number of years. </ParaText><ParaText id="603124">The most recent case is the Oakville refinery. This is an interesting case. Instead of Petro-Canada investing in this country in terms of the Oakville refinery, it decided to abandon it. When it was abandoned the company decided to import gasoline product from Esso. Recently there was a fire at its Sarnia refinery, and prices not only skyrocketed at Esso stations, but also at Petro-Canada because they are tied in with vertical integration. There is no competition. There does not have to be collusion; the fact is that this country has a lack of refining capacity and we depend upon a few key players in the market. With that type of a system we have to ask ourselves if we have the right public policy.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp><ParaText id="603125">The industry, science and technology committee recently did a study on the manufacturing industry. We laid out recommendations to help the manufacturing industry. Gasoline prices have been hurting that industry. Energy prices have been putting us at a lower competitive level. There are rising export prices and the rise in the value of the Canadian dollar. Research and development in this country by the oil and gas industry is less than 1%. The industry is doing research and development everywhere else but here. That has to change.</ParaText><ParaText id="603126">The New Democratic Party is calling for a public inquiry.

New Democrats believe ordinary Canadians are being cheated at the gas pump every time they fill up their cars. It is unfair for working and middle-class families to be gouged at the pump while big oil companies continue to reap record profits. Many people have no choice but to drive to work. The record prices we are seeing today have become a significant pay cut to their families.</ParaText><ParaText id="603143"> An independent watchdog needs to be set up to monitor prices and help protect against future gouging. </ParaText><ParaText id="603144">Today, Canadians find themselves trying to cope with uncontrolled rising gas prices because the Liberals and Conservatives consistently refused to act when gas prices spiked in the past. </ParaText><ParaText id="603145">For instance, a motion tabled in the House April 2005 would have created a petroleum monitoring agency. This motion was defeated when Conservatives and Liberals voted against the NDP and Bloc's efforts to implement the agency. </ParaText><ParaText id="603146">Federal legislation was also put forth by my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78884" Type="2">Windsor West</Affiliation>, to create a petroleum monitoring agency. A similar bill was brought forward by NDP MLA John Horgan to regulate prices on a provincial level in B.C.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603147">The Conservatives and Liberals have consistently supported the big corporations, whether they are banks, polluters or, in this case, oil companies. It is time to put fairness back into the way we behave so that there is money in the pocketbooks of consumers. </ParaText><ParaText id="603148">While consumers are paying sky-high prices, oil companies are making sky-high profits. As my colleague mentioned, the first quarter profits include the following: Imperial Oil/Esso, $774 million; Petro-Canada, $580 million; Encana, $497 million. All the while, gas prices continue to rise all across the country. They spiked earlier this week, with a high of $1.23 per litre in British Columbia.</ParaText><ParaText id="603149">Just like the phone and cable companies, oil companies and energy producers should have to justify and defend cost increases.</ParaText><ParaText id="603150">The Competition Bureau has already held hearings and nothing happened. In total, the Competition Bureau has held six major investigations into gas prices since 1990 and found that nothing that violated the Competition Act was present in any of those investigations. </ParaText><ParaText id="603151">This motion today calls for an inquiry which actually would help consumers and would limit what is happening. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603152">The Competition Bureau has limited powers to investigate and compel evidence to be brought forward and in fact the bureau, by its own mandate, must keep major portions of the findings secret. We want Canadians to hear from the people who sell us gas and working families want to know why gas prices spike and what the industry thinks we can do about it.</ParaText><ParaText id="603153">On average, a public inquiry runs on a budget of about $10 million. But after six investigations by the Competition Bureau, we still have no solid answers to the very real problem of rising gasoline prices. Ordinary Canadians expect more. Every month or two prices spike, sometimes to totally unreasonable levels. Consumers are seeing patterns, and we need to get to the bottom of this.</ParaText><ParaText id="603154">The House of Commons Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology has already held hearings and recommended, in November 2003, that a petroleum gas price monitoring agency be established. </ParaText><ParaText id="603155">That is just what New Democrats are calling for today. We need a gas price monitoring agency. That is the reason the NDP proposed to amend the Bloc motion to include the creation of a petroleum monitoring agency.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603156">The oil and gas sector in Canada is dominated by big business. Due to rising oil and gas prices, the industry has become one of the most profitable sectors in the economy, with record profits for each of the last four years. With those record profits, we see an increase in power and influence. Even with these record profits, the industry has one of the worst records with regard to investment in research and development, with among the lowest as a percentage of revenue or as a percentage of profits of any industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="603157">Still, the industry receives special tax breaks for capital cost allowances that the Conservatives would phase out over the next eight years. That would be eight years of more tax breaks at the expense of Canadians. The industry receives close to $2 billion a year in subsidies from the federal government.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="05">(1205)</Timestamp><ParaText id="603158"> The $2 billion could be used to fund an affordable housing program in this country. It could relieve poverty among Inuit communities across the north. The $2 billion could be used to create a department for Status of Women Canada. The $2 billion could create enough affordable child care spaces in Ontario. The $2 billion dollars could be used to create a better stand of living for our seniors by initiating a national home care plan which would allow seniors to stay in their homes and communities and out of long term care facilities.</ParaText><ParaText id="603159">I am sorry I have digressed, but the scope of this misspending is just breathtaking.</ParaText><ParaText id="603160">As many in the House know, the oil and gas industry grew as part of government policy. At a time of low oil prices, extremely low royalty rates were established for the highest cost production in the oil sands, the much higher oil prices that led to enormous investment and development in production on a scale unseen in this sector. It has also led to an enormous environmental degradation and the generation of pollution.</ParaText><ParaText id="603161">The oil sands sector is the largest greenhouse gas emission source in the country and it also consumes vast amounts of clean water.</ParaText><ParaText id="603162">The time has come to eliminate the absurd royalty regime and establish what is fair. It is time to eliminate subsidies for this profitable industry. It is time to create the incentives for the industry to reduce its emissions and invest in greener technology and fuels of the future.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603163">Rising gas prices hurt hard-working Canadians and their pocketbooks. It is unfair for big oil companies to continue to make record profits while they squeeze consumers at the pumps.</ParaText><ParaText id="603164">Some people may ask: are not high gas prices an incentive to use public transit? Why would environmentalists want to make gas cheaper and increase consumption? </ParaText><ParaText id="603165">Transit is the key to reducing gas consumption. We are in favour of increased funding and infrastructure for public transit, but we will not take the approach that increased profits for big oil and gas companies are acceptable. It punishes working and rural families who sometimes do not have any other option but to use a car. These companies should be focusing on providing efficient fuels instead of gouging consumers. </ParaText><ParaText id="603166">The Conservatives and the Liberals are not protecting consumers. Rather they are letting the big oil companies reap a profit off the backs of hard-working Canadians. Big oil and gas get a billion dollar subsidy from government and all the time they are making record profits. It is simply not acceptable.</ParaText><ParaText id="603167">I would like to point out that when in opposition the Conservatives called on the federal government to cut taxes on gasoline. Yet, now they are in government and they flip-flop and refuse to implement their own suggestion.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603168">It is very clear that what is necessary is an independent watchdog on gas prices to help protect against future gouging by the big gas and oil companies. </ParaText><ParaText id="603169">As I mentioned, the NDP proposed such legislation in 2004 and reintroduced it last spring. We could have had an independent watchdog already. This can work. Gas prices in P.E.I. are regulated by the provincial government and are generally lower than in the rest of Canada. Prices change only once a month. </ParaText><ParaText id="603170">In addition to introducing positive choices for Canadian consumers, the NDP wants to provide incentives for auto manufacturers to produce fuel efficient vehicles and for consumers to buy environmentally friendly cars.</ParaText><ParaText id="603171">Tax incentives should also be given to researchers to fund new fuel technologies and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels like gasoline. We need to do this as well as provide incentives for manufacturers to produce, and consumers to buy, more fuel efficient cars.</ParaText><ParaText id="603172">This is the approach that we should and can take.

I want to thank him for letting me speak first because we had planned it the other way around. </ParaText><ParaText id="603189"> It is my pleasure to rise today on this Bloc motion regarding a matter of vital concern to our economy: the surge in the price of gasoline. I can say, and it is probably true for all of us, that when we attend events on the weekend in our ridings or happen to bump into people in shopping centres or variety stores or even when getting a fill-up, we are often recognized by our constituents. </ParaText><ParaText id="603190"> I do not know whether others have noticed, although it can hardly be missed these days and has been going on for far too long, but people are complaining about the sharp increase in the price of petroleum products. The government seems to take it for granted that absolutely nothing can be done and the free market should simply be allowed to work the way the oil companies want. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603191"> We are going to have a holiday in May. In Quebec, the holiday on the third Monday in May is called the Fête nationale des patriotes. Elsewhere in Canada it is Victoria Day, and it used to be called the Fête de Dollard. The third Monday in May is a holiday, and today I would like to make a prediction: just before this long weekend starts, the price of gasoline will go up. </ParaText><ParaText id="603192"> In Quebec, construction workers have a holiday the last two weeks of July. Many working people, and not just in construction, take their holidays at this time. </ParaText><ParaText id="603193"> The weather is usually nice, although there are no assurances, and people take their holidays. They go all over Quebec and sometimes even drive to other Canadian provinces or the United States. People also take advantage of this period to go camping. So there is a lot of travel. Why, then, just before big vacation periods like this or the big summer holidays, does the price of gasoline always go up? </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603194"> The government is trying to tell us that it is just chance or the free market. This is not the first time, however, that the government has shown its strong attachment or affection for the oil companies. Who benefits and who pays? In the end, it is honest citizens who pay for this, ordinary people who often have to use their cars to travel. </ParaText><ParaText id="603195"> There is always public transit, of course, in the major centres. Unfortunately, in my riding in the Côte-de-Beaupré area, there is some public transit but the schedule does not necessarily suit everyone. It is the same story in Charlevoix and the upper north shore, where there is no public transit. People have to use their cars, therefore, in order to travel. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603196">People in the regions have an additional problem. Major hospital centres offer specialized medical services, but to see a doctor in Quebec City, people from Forestville, in my riding, or La Malbaie have to travel. The same is true in other regions such as the Lower St. Lawrence, the Gaspé peninsula and Abitibi, where people need a vehicle to get around and to travel to larger centres for treatment, services or specialized medical consultations. They have no choice.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp><ParaText id="603197">Another group affected by rising gas prices includes people who need a car for work. I am thinking about people who work hard and put in long hours for a miserable wage, sometimes earning $1.22 an hour. I am also thinking about taxi drivers and employees of small private trucking companies who have had to cope with the huge increase in the price of diesel. It used to be that there was always a large gap between the cost of diesel and the cost of regular or super gas, but now that difference is much smaller. In fact, the prices are almost the same.</ParaText><ParaText id="603198">When trucking costs go up, producers and processors tend to pass the higher gas prices on to consumers. There is a common thread running through all the examples I have given: ordinary Canadians are still paying the tab and the big oil companies are still profiting from these gas price increases.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603199">Before, we were told that there was instability in this or that oil producing country or that such increases were expected. Apparently, the gas people put in their cars on their way home today was processed over 60 days ago. So how is it that this morning, prices rose almost instantly even though refiners paid for today's gas 60 days ago?</ParaText><ParaText id="603200">These examples are proof of a major con job on the part of the oil companies. I want to be clear: when I say these things about oil companies, I am not blaming retailers or the people who operate stations for big companies, such as Petro-Canada, Shell and Esso. When people fill up, they might tell the attendant that this is crazy and ask why the price of gas just went up 10¢, but the price increase does not mean that the retailer is making more money. Some gas stations that also have mechanic shops have decided to get rid of their gas pumps because there is no money in it. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603201">Rising profits do not trickle down to gas station owners; they line the pockets of big oil companies, which rake in huge profits on refining. Apparently, refining margins were supposed to be on the order of five to seven cents, but we have seen profits as high as 23¢. It seems to me that I read somewhere that big oil companies have been making as much as 27¢ a litre on refining.</ParaText><ParaText id="603202">I see that I have less than a minute remaining, so I will conclude by saying that this government, which takes so much pride in saying that it listens to taxpayers, must accept its responsibilities. I urge citizens living in Conservative ridings to ask their members of Parliament how they plan to vote on the Bloc Québécois' opposition motion and what they really intend to do to stop oil companies from getting rich at the expense of taxpayers who have had enough of rising gas prices. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

A year ago, a barrel of oil was worth $73, and gas sold for $1.06 at the pump in Quebec. Today, gas sells for $1.15, while the price of a barrel of oil is much lower, at $61. If a barrel was worth $73 a year ago, how is it that a year later, when it is $61 a barrel, we are paying more for a litre of gas? The difference lies in the refining margin. While a reasonable refining margin is 4¢ to 7¢ a litre, last March and April it was over 15¢ a litre. As well, it climbed to 23¢ a litre last week, four times the reasonable margin.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603218"> There are four factors that can explain the rise in gas prices: the price of crude oil, the refining margin, taxes and the retail margin. The latter varies from 3.5¢ to 6¢ a litre, depending on the region. Apart from that, the retail margin is stable.</ParaText><ParaText id="603219"> Some will say that this is because of taxes, but taxes are also stable: the excise tax is 10% and the GST is 6.5%. The same is true at the provincial level. Taxes are not what make oil prices fluctuate.</ParaText><ParaText id="603220"> Refining, on the other hand, is a different story. To reduce their costs, the oil companies have closed a number of refineries, and as a result have been able to increase their production capacity. The gap between supply and demand has narrowed, and so the slightest weather-related or technical problem leads to a price increase to maintain the balance between those two factors.</ParaText><ParaText id="603221"> As my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78419" Type="2">Montmorency—Charlevoix—Haute-Côte-Nord</Affiliation> said, long weekends and vacations are not unforeseen events. And yet the oil companies do not seem to be able to prepare for them. One would think they were unaware that such events will occur and the price will fluctuate. And yet every year, and every time there is a vacation period or statutory holiday, we see their prices go up.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603222"> Can we imagine a small businessperson failing to keep any inventory in the lead-up to Christmas, and then claiming scarcity to raise prices? He or she could do just that; that is what we are experiencing, and yet it is the oil companies doing it. Because they sell an essential product and there is little competition, they make off with it all, while we depend on them.</ParaText><ParaText id="603223"> We can conclude that the inability of the refining industry to overcome the slightest hitch is responsible for recent increases. Is that situation intentional or not? We do not know, because the Competition Bureau does not have the tools that would enable it to carry out a serious, complete investigation; and that is the reason for our motion today.</ParaText><ParaText id="603224"> One thing is certain, however: the structure of the oil industry encourages precipitous price increases and provides the opportunity for abuse. That is why it must be monitored. In Halifax, Esso refines for all the companies; in New Brunswick, it is Irving; in Quebec City, it is Ultramar; and in Montreal, it is Petro-Canada and Shell. The refineries have all cut their gasoline supplies, and in so doing have caused the price to climb about a month earlier than usual. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603225">However, the oil industry is making huge profits. Some may say that the oil companies are not making money, but let us look at the profits they are making. Petro-Canada made a net profit of $590 billion in the first quarter, which is twice as much as the $206 billion it posted last year. It doubled its profits in a year. ExxonMobil took in an enormous net profit of $9.3 billion for the first three months of 2007 alone, which is a 10% increase over the same period last year. However, its sales were down 2% because the market price of oil went down. As I was saying earlier, the price per barrel of oil went from $73 to $61.</ParaText><ParaText id="603226">How was ExxonMobil able to exceed the record profit of $39.5 billion it posted in 2006? Thanks, in large part, to its refining margin which increased substantially. If the price per barrel of oil goes down, the oil companies lose a bit of money. They then increase the refining price in order to more than compensate for any loss.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp><ParaText id="603227">The gas crises may be a result of lack of competition in the oil industry. The three largest refiner-marketers have 75% of the market share. The five largest represent 90% of the market. The net profits combined of the six major integrated oil companies in Canada, Imperial Oil, Shell Canada, Husky Energy, Petro-Canada, EnCana and Suncor, reached $12 billion in 2006. In three years, they doubled their profits. It is incredible. The net profits of the entire oil industry have gone from $17 billion in 2003 to $20 billion in 2004 and $35 billion in 2006. That is a 100% increase. After all that, they complain when we want to take back a bit of that money. Give me a break!</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603228"> Furthermore, the oil companies that are investing in tar sands development in Alberta—the representative of the governing party and especially the <Affiliation DbId="78953" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry</Affiliation> were wondering about that—can deduct 100% of their investments from their income from the first year onwards. They can invest a dollar and deduct it the same year. It does not cost them much; things are going all right for them; life is beautiful.</ParaText><ParaText id="603229"> A recent study prepared by the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers did a three-year projection of the impact of all the tax breaks given to oil companies. I am talking about breaks, but we could call them gifts. In 2005 they paid $5.1 billion in taxes; in 2008 they will pay $2.3 billion. The income tax they pay has been cut in half. These are tax breaks from this government. We have to get our feet back on the ground. This is a federal income tax reduction of 54%. I would like all the citizens of Quebec to receive such tax reductions, not just the oil companies. The Bloc Québécois has often criticized these tax breaks for oil companies, but no one has made a move. It is time to do so now.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603230"> There are proposed measures for disciplining the industry. First of all the Competition Act must be strengthened. I am going to target the <Affiliation DbId="78953" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry</Affiliation> again. Because he misunderstood, I am going to explain to him so that he understands. The Competition Bureau cannot conduct an investigation on its own initiative; it must receive a complaint or a request from the <Affiliation DbId="78770" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation>, who will doubtless be asleep again, since has been asleep at the switch all this time.</ParaText><ParaText id="603231"> The Competition Bureau is sorely lacking in powers when it conducts a general review of the industry: it cannot summon witnesses. How can it operate? The bureau cannot even summon people as witnesses to find out whether there is any collusion. That is not right. It cannot ensure their protection so as to get them to talk. They cannot even be summoned, they cannot even be protected so that they will tell the truth. And then we are told that the Competition Bureau can do its work. Somebody should wake up. There is something missing here.</ParaText><ParaText id="603232"> Without these tools, it is almost impossible to prove collusion or any other anti-competitive practices. And even when competitors reach an agreement, the burden of proving collusion is on the Competition Bureau. Imagine that! This is a long way from burden of proof reversal. But that is what is being asked for.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603233">We must reinforce the Competition Act by giving real powers to the Competition Bureau. </ParaText><ParaText id="603234">Near the end of its mandate, the Liberal government introduced Bill <Document DbId="2012118" Type="3">C-66</Document>, which was for the most part inspired by a comprehensive plan tabled one month earlier.

Canadians work hard to earn a living. They work hard to have a healthy economy. The high price of gasoline is a financial pressure felt by all Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="603260">People must know that the price of gasoline is determined by the market, by the free market, and as far as we can see, the price of gasoline reflects at this time the changes in market conditions such as the increase in the price of a barrel, but mostly the low reserves in North America.</ParaText><ParaText id="603261">The increase in the demand combined with supply problems—yes, there are indeed supply problems—due to the maintenance of some North American refineries and even due to fires in some refineries in Canada and in the United States are partly to blame for the decline in the reserves.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603262"> We know very well that the Bloc members do not want to let the market work. As usual, they want government intervention. The Bloc members should know by now that controlling the economy, as Ronald Reagan said in one of his famous speeches, ultimately means controlling people and controlling Canadians. This government is in favour of the free market and prices in the petroleum industry that reflect market conditions. In contrast to the Bloc member, who would like a controlled economy, we are opposed to any socialist intervention in this sector. </ParaText><ParaText id="603263"> The Commissioner of Competition is not responsible for determining how much profit companies will make. Companies are free to set their own prices in light of demand and their costs of production. Business people in this country work very hard to earn a living and make a profit. We have a capitalist system. Profits are healthy and generate further economic development. Businesspeople deserve to reap the fruits of their labour. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603264"> The spirit of the Competition Act is to maintain and promote competition in Canada. We want an efficient economy that is able to adapt to globalization. The Competition Act exists as well to ensure that small and medium-sized businesses participate fully in the development of the Canadian economy. It is also important to remember that the act does not apply to only one sector of the economy. It does not apply just to the oil industry. The Competition Act is there to stimulate market forces. Prices in all markets go up—certainly they go up sometimes—but they also go down. </ParaText><ParaText id="603265"> Over the last few months, the price of gasoline went down at the pumps. Now we are seeing it go up, but in a few months, market forces should bring it down again because of a number of factors, some of which are predictable and some not. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603266"> Even though prices sometimes increase, I believe it is preferable to allow market forces to play their role rather than to increase state control of the economy. Sometimes, some companies may exhibit anti-competitive behaviour. It is important to keep that in mind. It is also important to have a Competition Act that works to eliminate that type of behaviour in Canada. That is the point where the Competition Bureau must intervene: when a company, regardless of its area of activity, acts in an anti-competitive way. </ParaText><ParaText id="603267"> As <Affiliation DbId="78770" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation>, I am convinced that the Competition Bureau will intervene very quickly if there is any suspicion that a company is not obeying the law. It has done so in the past and it will do so in the future. Competition Bureau investigations have led to 13 prosecutions relating to the price of gas and heating oil and there have been eight convictions. </ParaText><ParaText id="603268"> I can assure you that the Competition Bureau follows the activities of the oil and gas industry very closely.

I really wonder what led the members of the Bloc Québécois to launch this debate in the House this week. If I may be permitted a guess, we know that war is being waged within the sovereignist camp since the crushing defeat of the Parti Québécois, on March 26. Not a single day goes by without more news of the battle between the leader of the Bloc Québécois and André Boisclair, the leader of the Parti Québécois. </ParaText><ParaText id="603271"> By introducing this useless motion this week, the leader of the Bloc Québécois wants to distract the attention of the media who have been interested in this dispute in the sovereignist camp for several days already. However, there is at least one positive aspect to this business; the leader of the Bloc Québécois appears to have finally understood that he is useless in the House of Commons and that the Bloc Québécois is useless in Ottawa. So now he wants to move to Quebec City. The leader of the Bloc is jockeying with his friends to take over the leadership of the Parti Québécois. During this time, the leader of the Bloc Québécois in the House is doing everything within his power to succeed him. </ParaText>

Clearly more and more Bloc members are wondering why they are in Ottawa. They are realizing that they have not managed in any way to influence government policy over the past 15 years.

I would add that Quebeckers are lining up behind our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in increasing numbers because they can see that our party best defends the interests of Quebeckers in this House.

Quite simply, it is because of the famous law of supply and demand. </ParaText><ParaText id="603282">Currently, United States gasoline inventories, that is supply, are at their lowest level in 10 years. In May 2007, they were at around 190 million barrels, while in May 2006, they were at 210 million barrels. Thus, we see that inventories are extremely low, something we have not seen in 10 years.

Why is the inventory so low? Because it is being depleted, since there have been some fires in refineries. Moreover, very old refineries in the United States require regular maintenance, which forces production shutdowns. The inventory that is being sold is the inventory the Americans have. It is being depleted and we see that it is at its lowest level. </ParaText>

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Gourde" id="2065570"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="106038" Type="18">Mr. Jacques Gourde (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="603290">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to take part in this debate. There are few issues that Canadians care about as much as the price of gas, except, perhaps, the weather. Whether it is at the office or at the local eatery, everyone talks about it. Everyone has a theory on why the price of gas is so high. Governments are blamed, both Canadian and foreign, and oil companies are also accused.</ParaText><ParaText id="603291">Canadians are entitled to ask themselves questions and to be upset. After all, these high prices hit everyone of us where it hurts the most, that is in our wallet. </ParaText><ParaText id="603292">The new Government of Canada is committed to helping Canadians reduce their gas consumption, and thus save money and protect the environment. We think it is possible to achieve real progress regarding the environment, without jeopardizing our growth. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603293">However, that is not the Bloc Québécois' way of doing things. It cannot do anything constructive. In fact, the Bloc Québécois voted for a plan that will increase gas prices, a plan that will add to the tax burden of Canadian families. According to leading economists, the Liberal plan would trigger a 50% increase in hydro costs. As for the costs of heating homes with natural gas, they would basically double from what they are right now.</ParaText><ParaText id="603294">However, the debate must go beyond laying blame and throwing accusations. Increasingly, Canadians have the desire and the determination to act individually to fight price increases, and our government is helping them make informed energy choices.</ParaText><ParaText id="603295">The public is receptive. In a survey conducted last fall, three out of four respondents said they were very or quite interested in receiving information on how to reduce their energy consumption at home or on the road. We can do many things to reduce the impact of the price increase. The government is also taking many initiatives, and this is what I want to stress today.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603296">The price of gas is not the only factor that has an impact on our energy costs; there is also the way we drive. The government has published on the Internet a whole range of useful tips on buying, driving and maintaining a vehicle, tips that can help Canadians save money and gas while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These tips include respecting the speed limit since driving at 100 kilometres an hour instead of 120 kilometres an hour increases fuel efficiency by 20%; planning one's travel; using public transit as much as possible; avoiding idling; and ensuring that tires are properly inflated.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603297">Our energy efficiency programs help people save energy and reduce their costs as well as their greenhouse gas emissions. These programs can also reduce air pollution and make Canadian businesses and industries more competitive. They also contribute to the safety and reliability of our energy network by reducing the demand for energy.</ParaText><ParaText id="603298">Our energy efficiency programs target all sectors of our economy: real estate, industry, transportation and people. They are based on partnerships, which means that we get more value for the money invested by the federal government when we work with other partners. These programs also provide tools and networks to which the provinces, territories and public utilities can add value or which they can use to meet the objectives of their own regional energy efficiency programs. </ParaText><ParaText id="603299">We are using various approaches to offer our energy efficiency programs to Canadians. Our information programs advise energy consumers about the benefits of energy efficiency and renewable energy. They help people familiarize themselves with and accept the technologies and related practices, which leads to their use. Our voluntary action programs support efforts made by individuals to consume energy more efficiently by inviting flagship businesses in the private sector to show leadership and by encouraging them to set and meet energy efficiency targets.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp><ParaText id="603300"> We are using regulations that set minimum performance standards in order to eliminate less energy efficient products from the market. Through better management of our fleet and strategic purchasing that draws on green energy, we are teaching by example and showing Canadians that we can demonstrate leadership on the energy efficiency front. Significant improvements in energy efficiency in all sectors of the economy are directly attributable to our programs. </ParaText><ParaText id="603301"> Canada has more products subject to the Energy Efficiency Regulations than any other country. The last amendment to those regulations alone is expected to enable consumers to achieve net benefits totalling $47 million by the year 2010. Refrigerators that need only 25% of the energy consumed by a refrigerator in the 1970s are currently available on the market.</ParaText><ParaText id="603302"> We support the construction of new ethanol production facilities, and this calls for major financial commitments by the private sector. This initiative will assist in expanding the production and use of ethanol fuel in Canada.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603303"> We are working with industry so that it can improve the energy performance of its activities, under the Canadian Industry Program for Energy Conservation, a unique industry-government partnership. </ParaText><ParaText id="603304"> One day, that performance will play a key role in the concrete measures to be taken by the Government of Canada to ensure that we all enjoy clean air, uncontaminated land, clean water and clean energy. Concrete results lie at the heart of what our government is committed to delivering.</ParaText><ParaText id="603305"> It is important that Canadians conserve energy by improving energy efficiency in everything they do, whether in operating a business, driving a car or building a house. Improved energy performance makes absolute sense in both economic and environmental terms.</ParaText><ParaText id="603306"> Energy conservation and performance are important components of any realistic and effective Canadian solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in a sensible way for all Canadians. To accomplish this, we must coordinate our efforts. All levels of government, whether federal, provincial or municipal, must be involved, and industry and communities must fall into step.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603307"> Although we know where the limits to our powers lie, we also know that by working together we can achieve much greater success than by working alone, each of us in our own corner. I hope that the House will agree with me that a new era of cooperation between the federal and provincial governments on natural resource policies will provide Canadians with unprecedented prosperity.</ParaText><ParaText id="603308"> The development of new technologies is one of the primary areas where we can join forces. Innovative and ground-breaking technologies are the key to Canada's future when it comes to natural resources. The natural resources industry is a high tech industry, and it is Canada's technologies and know-how that have made Canadian business so competitive on the world market. The truth of this can be seen in the resource exploitation technologies that Canada supplies to the rest of the world.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

He is telling us that consumers must change their driving habits, refrain from idling their cars, inflate their tires properly and stay within speed limits. We have even been told about a program to change refrigerators and about the need for municipalities to do their share. That is anything but answering the question raised today by the Bloc Québécois with its motion about controlling the price of gasoline.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603326">Last week, the refining margin of oil companies was 23¢ a litre, that is four times the reasonable margin. It has always been calculated—this has never been challenged by experts—that, to make a reasonable profit, refineries should take between 4¢ and 7¢ a litre. This is the international standard. It has been recognized and no one has ever challenged that amount. However, in March and April of last year, their margin was 15¢ a litre. Thus, theoretically, it was twice the reasonable profit that they should have taken for refining. Once again, last week, it was 23¢ a litre. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603327">Thus, it is not surprising that declared profits and shareholders' dividends are constantly going up. For the eight big oil companies doing business in Canada, we are talking about $12 billion in profits, profits as high as the surplus of the Government of Canada. This is the reality. They are no longer playing in the small leagues. The government has chosen to favour a class of citizens, shareholders of big oil companies, at the expense of consumers. This is the hard reality, and it is what the Bloc Québécois wants to stop. Through all kinds of measures, the government is encouraging oil companies to rake in profits in a totally irresponsible way. It is profit at any cost, at the expense of consumers.</ParaText><ParaText id="603328">I am quite astounded that the <Affiliation DbId="106038" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> would tell us that consumers must change their driving habits. I agree, but perhaps companies should change their habits of making profits at the expense of consumers. The federal government has a role to play there. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603329">There were investigations by the Competition Bureau in the past even though the current commissioner and her predecessors in recent years have all told us repeatedly that they could not investigate. In response to the questions they were asked, the companies said that there was no collusion. No one believes that anymore as gas prices go up almost automatically on the eve of every long weekend or summer vacation. Nobody is fooled by what is going on in the industry. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603330">What we are saying today is that oil companies are acting irresponsibly with regard to refining margins in Canada. Refining is done regionally. Refineries located across Canada have downsized. These industries do the refining for their own competitors regionally. In fact, there is no competition. It is not like the supermarket system that can guarantee real competition by lowering prices to attract clients. That is how things work in the food industry, but not in the oil industry, and certainly not in the refining industry. Depending on the region, companies buy their oil from their competitor's refinery. Why? Because the number of refineries has been reduced in Canada. Competition has been tightened to the point where it has lead to scarcity. Refineries became scarce, so now oil has become scarce.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp><ParaText id="603331">That allows all companies to raise their prices at the same time and also to increase their profit margin on refining. That is where the problem lies. </ParaText><ParaText id="603332">The <Affiliation DbId="106038" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> has a problem if he does not see it. Maybe he also has problems with other issues and we could discuss it in due time, but he certainly has a problem if he does not understand how refining works. It is true that provinces are responsible for prices at the pump, but the federal government, through the Competition Act has the responsibility to ensure that there is no unfair competition and no collusion in refining. That is federal jurisdiction. </ParaText><ParaText id="603333">In simple terms, the Bloc motion asks, and I read it again:</ParaText><ParaText id="603334"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That, in the opinion of the House, the government should move an amendment to the Competition Act so that the Commissioner of Competition have the power to initiate investigations of the price of gas and the role of refining margins in the determination of the said price.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603335">That is what we are asking the House to do. I cannot understand why the Conservatives do not support this proposal from the Bloc. It is in the interests of society as a whole that we be able to shed light on the unfair profits that end up in the pockets of the few shareholders of oil companies and, quite often, in the pockets of company presidents, who pay themselves generous bonuses at the end of the year because profits have increased. That is totally irresponsible when companies' profits increase every year and when we see, as we did last week, that profits and refining margins have increased fourfold, by 23¢ a litre. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603336">These are not made-up figures, but statistics that are available and are monitored by experts. Last week, all the companies took a refining margin of 23¢ a litre, four times the usual profit margin of 4¢ to 7¢. In March and April, they were taking 15¢ a litre on average, twice the usual margin. It is not right that the companies should be able to play with these values. They took 15¢ on average in March and April and 23¢ last week. This represents an increase of 8¢ per litre of gas, and the only explanation for such a jump is that the companies took advantage of the shortage of refineries and supply to create artificial inflation. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603337">This is what the Bloc Québécois wants to investigate. It wants to toughen the Competition Act to ensure that there is no collusion between these companies. If these investigations prove that there is no collusion, then at least we will have gotten to the bottom of things.</ParaText><ParaText id="603338">There is a problem when the Commissioner of Competition tells us that she does not have the authority to get to the bottom of things. It is difficult for me to understand some things, particularly that the <Affiliation DbId="106038" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78465" Type="2">Lotbinière—Chutes-de-la-Chaudière</Affiliation>, would say that there is no question of controlling gas prices and that all he is going to do is tell consumers to change how they drive or buy new refrigerators to combat the energy crisis in another way, or tell the municipalities to do their part.</ParaText><ParaText id="603339">Of course, everyone will have to do their part, but the oil companies should maybe start by doing their part and being completely transparent, explaining why the prices at the pump go up on the same day all across Quebec. In Montreal, four different companies at an intersection raise their prices at the pump at the same time on the same day. We want to try to find out why.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603340">I see that I have only a minute left, so I will conclude by saying that the Bloc Québécois is clearly the only party in this House that cares about the interests of the public, of Quebeckers.

There are people who are broke and who need gas to earn their living.

It is important to investigate that. </ParaText><ParaText id="603366"> All those politicians, the men and women in politics who say they want to act on behalf of families, young people, the needy, should want to know whether this mind-boggling price increase is justified or not. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp><ParaText id="603367"> This is extremely important. </ParaText><ParaText id="603368"> The Bloc is asking for the support of the House concerning this measure that affects everyone. We know that Quebec is not an oil producer; other provinces are. Since Quebec imports all the oil it uses, it is obvious that higher prices are making it poorer. This price increase means that in terms of exports, we had a surplus in 2005 and a deficit of $7 billion in 2006. We went from a trade surplus to a deficit of $7 billion. That is exactly the amount of the increase in the price of oil for the same year, an increase of $7 billion. </ParaText><ParaText id="603369"> This is important, because it means not only that this increase in the price of oil is having an impact on everyone’s wallet but that it is affecting the little man most. It is not only affecting the average person’s pocket book, but it is also affecting the entire economy for a variety of reasons. Since companies are having to buy more oil, there is a significant difference between the previous trade surplus and the current deficit of $7 billion. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603370"> In fact, last year, every Quebecker—we know that the averages are wrong, especially in this sector—consumed $1,000 more than he produced. Oil is making us poor. What do we want? We want to redistribute resources—and wealth in a way—so that the oil sector stops impoverishing society. Imposition of a surtax of $500 million on the profits of the oil companies would be one way of doing so. They are certainly capable of paying it. The accelerated capital cost allowance for tar sands must also be stopped when the price of crude goes beyond a threshold of somewhere between $40 and $50. </ParaText><ParaText id="603371"> The government announced this measure, but it does not intend to implement it for three years, while oil production from the tar sands continues to grow. This involves making changes to the tax system applicable to natural resources that enables the oil companies to reduce their payments by another $250 million a year, and having them pay for environmental damage.</ParaText><ParaText id="603372"> This is the bare minimum. We have just learned from the federal government’s latest statement that the government will favour the oil companies. The focus on oil in this country is costing the little people a lot and is making some provinces richer, but quite clearly it is impoverishing Quebec, whose trade surplus fell by the same amount as gas prices rose.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603373"> Since I only have a minute left, I will add that I hope that the Bloc will have the support of the House to at least shed some light on this issue. There is not a member in this House who cannot wish to shed some light on this content or this explanation of the oil companies’ price rises, especially in the refining margin, which is three times higher than it should be.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

She is right, it is about a transfer of wealth. It is about the fact that 16% of every manufacturing job in the province of Ontario depends on the oil patch in Alberta. I know she does not care about that in the province of Quebec, but it is also about transfer of wealth in terms of the equalization payments that go to Quebec that are funded by, in very large part, the oil patch in Alberta and taxpayers in Alberta.We do not mind that. I certainly do not mind that as an Albertan. </ParaText>

Under the Liberal plan for Kyoto, it would go to $1.60 or $2.00 a litre. I am sure she would find that unfair. But what is fair? People say this is an unfair rise or that it is an unreasonable profit.

These countries treat the environment with respect and enjoy the best social and working conditions.

The Competition Act contains regulations that ensure Canadians are treated fairly in the marketplace and that corporations in positions of market dominance do not abuse their status to the detriment of consumers.</ParaText><ParaText id="603387">The Competition Bureau is an independent law enforcement agency responsible for the administration of the Competition Act, which includes provisions against price fixing, price maintenance and abusive behaviour by a dominant firm, resulting in a lessening of competition. The Competition Bureau's role is to protect competition in the marketplace so that Canadians can benefit from competitive prices, product choice and quality service. All of its provisions apply to gasoline and other petroleum products.</ParaText>

Complaints are examined to determine whether the provisions of the Competition Act have been violated. </ParaText><ParaText id="603389">We hear over and over again that the Competition Bureau has conducted, since 1990, six major investigations into allegations of collusion in the gasoline industry and that it has consistently found no evidence to suggest that periodic price increases resulted from a conspiracy to limit competition in gasoline supply. </ParaText><ParaText id="603390">However, collusion is not the issue. Enhancing competition at the refinery level clearly is.</ParaText><ParaText id="603391">We need to acknowledge that the Competition Bureau has serious limitations.

							<ParaText id="603394">Where prices are not regulated, they are determined by market forces. I understand that all of us as Canadians are seeing gasoline prices rise and that people are upset at what they see as unfair prices and taxes at the pump.</ParaText><ParaText id="603395">Gasoline pricing is one of the most talked about and studied consumer related issues in Canada and probably the one that is most hated when people pay $100 to fill up their cars. Just last week this issue was raised to me at a local meeting of the North Islington seniors. Seniors are part of our community who immediately feel the impact of these increases in costs, as well as other families struggling on low fixed incomes. Seniors who are on very limited fixed incomes simply cannot afford to pay the astronomically high prices that we have seen lately. Just putting gas in the car to get to their appointments is creating a hardship on their lives. </ParaText>

From the trucking industry that delivers food to our grocery stores, to low income families trying to make ends meet, rising gas prices are creating strains on budgets across the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="603397">It is not just the rising price of gasoline that is affecting my constituents in my riding of York West. The price of natural gas, which has almost doubled since last year, will continue to hit senior citizens and others living on fixed incomes much harder this coming winter.</ParaText><ParaText id="603398">The Ontario Energy Board has approved a 19% increase in natural gas prices to reflect the rising cost to distributors. With this increase, rates will have risen 45% since October of 1999. That translates to about $430 more a year per residential customer. Seniors on pensions and low income families, those living on fixed incomes, simply cannot afford another $400 or $500 to keep warm this winter. </ParaText><ParaText id="603399">When the Liberal government was in power, twice it introduced energy rebate programs when the energy costs got to an all time high. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603400">The volatility of gasoline prices and recent high fuel prices continue to generate discussion about market fairness and the competitive nature of the retail gasoline market in Canada. The Liberal government understood the majority of the pump price of gasoline comes from the price of crude oil, a globally traded commodity. The Liberal government acted to diversify our fuel supply. Some examples include the fact that we supported initiatives that would diversify Canada's fuel supply, such as Alberta's oil sands, Hibernia in Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia's Terra Nova.</ParaText><ParaText id="603401">We worked toward increasing performance standards for vehicles to make them more fuel efficient. We invested money in green fuel research and used fiscal policy to promote the development of green energy.</ParaText><ParaText id="603402">We also developed EnerGuide to promote energy efficiency in homes and places of business, which was a very popular program among many people in Canada. Sadly, this program fell victim to the minority Conservative government's radical cuts.</ParaText><ParaText id="603403">The Liberal Party is certainly sympathetic to consumers paying high prices for gasoline and our record shows this. We support any measure that increases transparency in the international and domestic markets for gasoline.</ParaText><ParaText id="603404">This motion proposes to strengthen the Competition Act to allow for investigations into gasoline prices and, specifically, their relationship to the refining margin and corporate profits. Therefore, I am pleased to support it today.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603405">On October 6, 2005, the Liberal Party introduced measures to strengthen transparency in the energy market. As part of Bill C-66, $13 million was set aside to give Canada's Competition Bureau more powers and to strengthen the Competition Act in response to high energy costs. I would like to acknowledge the work of my colleague from Pickering—Scarborough East. In the years that I have been here this is an issue that he has championed all of those years to try to get changes.</ParaText><ParaText id="603406">This would have given Canada's Competition Bureau more powers and would have strengthened the Competition Act. Bill C-66 also committed $15 million to establish an office of energy price information to monitor energy price fluctuations and provide clear current information to Canadians. However, Bill C-66 was one of the first casualties of the minority Conservative government when it took power. </ParaText><ParaText id="603407">The Conservative government has flip-flopped on this issue since the first days of the minority Conservative government.

								<Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentRest="1" IndentFirst="2">That, in the opinion of the House, the government should move an amendment to the Competition Act so that the Commissioner of Competition have the power to initiate investigations of the price of gas and the role of refining margins in the determination of the said price.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="603690">The main element is certainly the refining margins. The current situation with gas prices is really unacceptable. Canada produces a lot of oil and gasoline. Yet, we have seen gas prices increase steadily since this government took office in January 2006. We definitely have to look into the situation. The government members have no desire whatsoever to try and find ways to ensure that Canadians have access to reasonably priced gasoline. People are not asking for miracles, but they want to be able to buy gas at a reasonable price, which is definitely not the case right now.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603691">Let us compare urban and rural areas. In urban areas, people can take public transit, be it the bus or the subway, to go to work, do groceries and so on. </ParaText><ParaText id="603692">In rural areas, there are no such services available, and we cannot get them, even though we should probably have access to public transit. People in rural areas have to drive their personal vehicle to the grocery store, to work, and they often have to drive long distances. Rural areas are often also remote areas, large areas requiring that one drive long distances, many kilometres, if not hundreds of kilometres, to go to work.</ParaText><ParaText id="603693">In such circumstances, rising gas prices can certainly represent a barrier for consumers, especially since they have no choice; they absolutely have to put gasoline in their cars if they want to go to work.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603694"> Wages are not going up at the same rate as the price of gasoline. Some people have jobs in seasonal industries where the work is not always distributed over 12 months or 52 weeks a year, and they have to be able to find the money they need to fill up their cars while still being able to put bread, butter and food on the table to feed their families, their children. </ParaText><ParaText id="603695"> We are asking so little of the government. It is incredible and shameful that all the members of the Conservative government, which has been in power for far too long, are obstructing this and doing what they can to ensure that the price of gasoline does not come down in Canada. We have a government that absolutely does not want to do anything, that does not want to take any action, that wants laissez-faire and says the market will decide. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603696"> Whenever it is said that the market will decide, that means abuses are very possible. Not very long ago, the refining margin for producers was 7.2¢. That was the average between 1998 and 2003. I have been told this was already far too much, but it was the average over this five-year period. Nowadays, the refining margin is nearly 26¢ and often even more. </ParaText><ParaText id="603697"> If the government thinks this is acceptable, we should ask into whose pockets the Conservatives want this money to go. Do they want it to go to the oil companies or do they want to make the effort to give a little of it back to taxpayers? We should make a comparison. We should look at what the reality is. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="10">(1510)</Timestamp><ParaText id="603698"> Gasoline retailers in Canada have an average margin of 3.5¢ a litre when they sell their gas. They employ people at street corners all over Canada, and their margin is 3.5¢ or less, while the big refineries have a margin that is often as much as 26¢. </ParaText><ParaText id="603699"> Their margin is therefore 26¢ out of the current price of $1.15, or even more in some parts of the country. That is rather abusive and excessive. If the margin for refiners were the average for the 1998 to 2003 period, or about 7¢ a litre, the current price would be about 96¢. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603700">This would reduce the refining margin by about 19¢, and the price of a litre of gas would currently be around 96¢. I am convinced that the public would at least acknowledged that an effort has been made. All we are asking from the Conservative government is to ensure that mechanisms are in place to allow workers, families and seniors to be a little better off, as well as all those who must use their car for various reasons, such as taking their children to activities, going to church on Sunday, doing the groceries once a week, and going to work every day. We want this government to be a little more compassionate, to think about those who must use their vehicle to earn a living and be able to pay for food, hydro and shelter. </ParaText><ParaText id="603701">In fact, the public is not asking for much. These people are not getting salary increases, but their costs are constantly increasing. Does a 26¢ margin not look excessive, compared to the 7.2¢ margin? </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603702">The Conservatives must believe that a 26¢ margin is respectable and acceptable. They are providing all sorts of excuses. They will say that it is the market that decides. If it is the market that decides, then they can invoke all the good reasons. Whenever anything happens, it seems as though the price of gas goes up by 10¢. Whenever we hear rumours about a war somewhere, the price of gas goes up by 15¢.</ParaText><ParaText id="603703">In the end, where does that money go? It is the refining margin that increases. It is the margin that refiners give themselves that goes up. Whenever there is speculation, not at the stock exchange, but about the weather or conflicts around the world, all the decisions made are based exclusively on that and, all of a sudden, prices go up. The cost of a barrel of oil has not necessarily increased by that much. However, if we look at the situation, we see that costs have gone up. It is oil companies that benefit from all this, not workers. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603704">The government opposite claims it is working in the best interest of the people. In this case, and in many others, it is clearly not working in the best interest of the people. It is out to do anything but try to help citizens.</ParaText><ParaText id="603705">We have to find ways to stabilize the situation and ensure better prices. Among other things, the competition commissioner must be authorized to make his own decision about holding an inquiry. Proactive is the key word here. The Conservative government has been reactive for weeks and months. It is reacting because it is unable to correct the situation going on within its own party. It is reactive.</ParaText><ParaText id="603706">Why is the government unable to accept that the competition commissioner can be proactive and make his own decisions about a situation?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603707">The competition commissioner must have the power to force oil companies to disclose information, provide evidence and prove that a situation really is serious and that prices are not going up 10¢ just because of high winds in eastern Canada or the possibility of conflict elsewhere in the world. The government must take responsibility in this situation. Right now, the Conservative government is not even able to shoulder its responsibilities. It is offloading its responsibilities onto seasonal workers, day labourers, families and seniors. It is not interested in helping these people live better lives.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="15">(1515)</Timestamp><ParaText id="603708">Why is the Conservative government working so hard to ensure that oil companies can boost their profits not by hundreds, thousands or millions of dollars, but by tens of millions and tens of billions of dollars at the expense of workers? Why does the Conservative government not bring in these little changes that could certainly lower the price of gas and help the people in our ridings who need it the most? Why does the government not have a heart in this matter?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Blaney" id="2066171"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78459" Type="2">Mr. Steven Blaney (Lévis—Bellechasse, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="603709">Mr. Speaker, I listened closely to the speech by the hon. member for Madawaska—Restigouche. I want to take this opportunity to say hello to the people of New Brunswick and tell them that, fortunately, with a Conservative government, gas prices are twice as low as they would be if our Liberal friends opposite were in power, because with Bill <Document DbId="2181701" Type="4">C-288</Document> and its draconian reductions of greenhouse gases, and after 13 years of their inaction, our gas prices would be twice as high. This is a major concern.</ParaText><ParaText id="603710">I was in Lévis Monday morning before coming here and the price of gas was $1.17. I think about all the workers from Bellechasse who go to work and sometimes have to make wage concessions. This is a worrisome situation and that is why our government is concerned about this situation and is putting more money back into the taxpayers' pockets, by reducing the GST, for example, to help workers better cope with these price increases. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603711">There is one thing the previous government did not do. Why did it do absolutely nothing in 13 years to reduce greenhouse gases, while our government has invested several billion dollars in the past 15 months to encourage people to buy fuel efficient vehicles? We are even putting surcharges on vehicles that consume a lot of energy. We have implemented tax credits for public transit and we want to ensure that our economy is no longer dependent on hydrocarbons with the ecoenergy and ecotrust programs.</ParaText><ParaText id="603712">My question for the hon. opposition member is the following. Why is his leader, who is in support of gas prices being twice as high with Bill <Document DbId="2181701" Type="4">C-288</Document>, pleased—it was in the <I>Calgary Herald</I> on August 24, 2005—that the price of gas in Canada is high for the short, medium and long terms when that is detrimental to the country's workers?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. D'Amours" id="2066206"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78809" Type="2">Mr. Jean-Claude D'Amours</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="603713">Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to my hon. colleague's question.</ParaText><ParaText id="603714">I just talked about speculation and indicated that, every time there was the slightest puff of wind, the price of gas went up 10¢. Every time there was a risk of conflict or if someone mentioned conflict anywhere in the world, it went up 15¢.</ParaText><ParaText id="603715">I hope that the speculation by my colleague opposite, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78459" Type="2">Lévis—Bellechasse</Affiliation>, will not drive the price of gas up 20¢ by tomorrow, because, once again, he is indulging in speculation when he says if this or the other thing occurs. That is precisely the problem at this time. Every time someone says “If such-and-such happens, the price will increase”, that is exactly what happens the next day. I hope my colleague from Lévis—Bellechasse will be a little more careful about what he says so that prices do not increase. One way of doing this is by assuring this House that they will not increase the price of gas and ensuring greater control. Why do the Conservatives not want to accept this?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603716">Ultimately, I could throw a question back to my colleague opposite by asking him if his party will respect the vote taken in 2004, under which the GST would no longer be added once the price of gas reached 85¢ or higher—he just said that gas is at $1.17 in his region, and I might add that it is even higher where I am from, in Madawaska—Restigouche. With the difference between 85¢ and $1.17, my colleague opposite would likely have some savings for his constituents. However, the Conservatives do not seem to have enough backbone to ensure that their constituents enjoy lower prices at the pump, that they are also respected, by giving them the tools they need to be able to drive to work every day and attend to their family's various activities.</ParaText><ParaText id="603717">The member opposite and all Conservative members of this House refuse to even look at this situation. This is the reality. I hope the Conservatives will stop speculating, because every time they speculate about something, I fear the oil companies will increase prices even further and we will be stuck in a real dilemma. Who will pay for it at the end of the day? It will be the citizens of our respective regions.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

This motion has no doubt been read and referred to many times already, but I think it is important to read it one more time, because the more we repeat something, the better our chances of getting the message across to the people opposite.</ParaText><ParaText id="603726"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That, in the opinion of the House, the government should move an amendment to the Competition Act so that the Commissioner of Competition have the power to initiate investigations of the price of gas and the role of refining margins in the determination of the said price.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="603727"> I should say, first off, that I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78662" Type="2">Berthier—Maskinongé</Affiliation>. With that, I begin my speech, which should be very short. Much could be said, however, about gas prices because many things have happened with regard to that. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603728">We could call this a cyclical issue. I arrived in this House in 1998 and, starting in 2000, there was more and more talk about it. About two years after my arrival, and together with the Bloc Québécois industry and transportation critics, I organized with my party a tour through Quebec because at that time oil prices were on the rise again. This increase in oil prices affects all consumers and the entire population because they purchase gas for their cars or also, and primarily, heating oil for those who still use this fuel to keep warm in winter. For years, every time the price went up, some individuals almost died during very cold spells in Quebec and Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="603729">It is all well and good to talk about the price of a barrel of oil but this price is not always reflected at the pump. Just because the barrel price is moderately high and it goes up does not mean that the price per litre will be adjusted accordingly. A number of factors come into play. Naturally, there is the cost of oil exploitation, refining, distribution, retailing. All these levels make it possible for some potential play in the price on the part of the oil companies.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603730">I was saying earlier that this is a cyclical issue. People get involved and want to work on behalf of the public and to help them out. In this regard, I would like to point out the initiative of the Sherbrooke Chamber of Commerce, which decided to consult the general public. In record time, it collected more than 10,300 responses in support of the Chamber of Commerce. It analysed and studied fluctuating gas prices. The findings will be presented in the near future by the Sherbrooke Chamber of Commerce. However, we should mention that, in general, we know that there are significant regional differences. The initiative of this Chamber of Commerce will result in pressure being applied across Quebec for the Quebec federation of chambers of commerce to present an analysis as well and, for all intents and purposes, make recommendations to oil companies, retailers and, I hope, to the government. I congratulate the Chamber of Commerce for its initiative, which clearly shows that there are significant differences in the price fluctuations.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603731">The study looked at regional variations and fluctuations over a fairly long period of time prior to the consultation. What is quite odd is that since the study started and practically up until today, the region's position has improved once the oil companies and retailers knew that someone was monitoring their prices.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="25">(1525)</Timestamp><ParaText id="603732">The Bloc had always proposed and strongly suggested that the government implement what I would call a commission for the monitoring of gas prices and price fluctuations, to conduct analyses and make recommendations.</ParaText><ParaText id="603733">There has been much talk about fluctuating gas prices, but there is a problem. We must be aware of this, and at some point, we must stop making partisan speeches about an issue that affects the entire population, the companies and the economy of Quebec. There is a big problem in that it is a natural resource which can be easily harnessed and which makes oil companies rich. At the same time, it is the main source of greenhouse gases.</ParaText><ParaText id="603734">We are calling for a decrease in the price of gas, and at the same time, we want to ensure increased use, which also affects greenhouse gases. It is a vicious circle. But we must at least remember that the people not only pay a fair price for gas and fuel oil to boost the economy, of course, but also to ensure a decent standard of living for everyone.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603735"> In my opinion, we must really focus on social justice and on equity and the fairness of the price of gasoline, as well. There are huge variations, and people do not have the impression they are paying what it is worth, which means that the cost of fighting greenhouse gases must also be paid through the cost of gasoline. </ParaText><ParaText id="603736"> This money, the profits made by the oil companies, which, in recent years, have recorded profits in the tens of billions of dollars, must also be made available to serve the community as a whole. Some will say, as the <Affiliation DbId="78770" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> argued recently, that natural resources belong to no one. There is an expression we use sometimes, which says that to the victor go the spoils. These people are snatching as many of the spoils as they can in their frantic race to exploit natural resources.</ParaText><ParaText id="603737"> When I spoke earlier of gasoline, I mentioned two important aspects, namely, the environmental aspect, of course, and, in addition, the economic aspect. We will recall that the <Affiliation DbId="78770" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> reminded us of this in a speech in rather odd terms. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603738"> I quote freely from the remarks of the <Affiliation DbId="78770" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation>. Of course, we should expect nothing from the Conservatives in this matter, as the party is interested more in protecting the interests of the oil industry than those of Quebec and Canadian taxpayers. And, like his colleagues, the minister and member for <Affiliation DbId="78461" Type="2">Beauce</Affiliation> said without a blush during the latest election campaign that those responsible for the high cost of gasoline were the left and the environmentalists. Therefore, those responsible for the increased cost of gasoline are those working for social justice, fairness for all and the protection of the environment. I do not think that is quite the way it is. </ParaText><ParaText id="603739"> In closing, since I see that my time is about up, I would remind the House of the measures put forward by the Bloc over time, for a number of years, and by certain Liberals who worked on gasoline matters for many months. There must be controls over the oil companies by means of the Competition Act together with a price monitoring agency, and the commissioner must be given the powers to investigate the cost of gasoline. </ParaText>

The motion we have introduced today concerns a very serious problem: the rise in gas prices. We must not forget that this has wide-reaching effects and is often very harmful to our economy. For example, the increase has a direct impact on the manufacturing industry, which is a major employer in my regional county municipality, in the county where I work and throughout Quebec. I hardly need remind this House that this industry is already in serious trouble.</ParaText><ParaText id="603752">Higher gas prices are driving up production costs and driving down badly needed investments in modernizing our manufacturing plants. </ParaText><ParaText id="603753">While our manufacturing sector is crumbling, our oil companies are continuing to post record profits, and greenhouse gas emissions are still rising. The combined net profits of the six largest integrated oil companies in Canada reached $12 billion in 2006. This is a $5 billion increase over 2004. Proportionally, profits are 70% higher than in 2004. We understand now that these figures are creating monstrous inflation in Quebec and across Canada.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603754">What is the government doing to address these issues that are so vital to our economy? In both cases, it is using the same logic, which is simply to do nothing. We know that doctrinaire Conservatives believe that the free market can take care of everything and that any government intervention will only prevent the market from generating benefits. Unlike the Conservative government, we believe that it is possible to limit gas price increases, at least partially, which is why the member for <Affiliation DbId="78635" Type="2">Joliette</Affiliation> has introduced this motion asking the government to amend the Competition Act so that the Competition Bureau can conduct investigations into the price of gas and the role of refining margins in determining gas prices.</ParaText><ParaText id="603755">Obviously, we are discussing gas prices today because they have jumped in recent days and weeks. Last week, the price of regular gas at the pump was $1.15 on average. Fluctuations aside, the price of gas is rising steadily in Quebec. In 2004, the average price of regular gas was 85.7¢. In 2005, it reached 96.7¢.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603756">Why has the price of gas gone up? The price at the pump is made up of four main factors: the price of crude oil, which has gone up, taxes, the retailer mark-up and the refining margin.</ParaText><ParaText id="603757">A thorough analysis of the causes of gas price hikes reveals that the retailer mark-up has remained stable. Taxes have also remained stable. The rising price of crude explains the rising price at the pump to a certain extent, but it is clear that major increases are due in large part to the rising cost of refining oil, which is where big oil companies' outrageous profit margins have increased the most lately.</ParaText><ParaText id="603758">According to the Association québécoise des indépendants du pétrole, a reasonable profit margin at the refining stage is between 4¢ and 7¢ per litre. In April 2006, that profit margin was 19.5¢, and last Wednesday, it was up to a record-setting 27¢ per litre, the highest ever except for a short period following hurricane Katrina.</ParaText><ParaText id="603759">To understand this situation, we must remember that in 1990, oil companies downsized their North American refining operations. To cut costs, they closed several refineries.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp><ParaText id="603760">As a result, supply soon matched demand. Therefore, when technical or weather-related incidents affect refining operations, price hikes are inevitable. That is not all. Slight increases in demand, such as during long weekends, often spur price hikes. For consumers, long weekends and summer vacations are not unexpected events. However, oddly enough, big oil companies never seem to be able to predict these periods and to prepare for them accordingly. They have nothing in reserve, and they tell us that the price increase is due to scarcity. We have seen this happen for years now.</ParaText><ParaText id="603761">The refining industry's inability—deliberate or otherwise—to respond to unexpected events raises a lot of questions. It is clear to us that the current structure of the oil industry leads to price hikes and market abuses. Although the industry is trying to persuade consumers that they are being treated fairly, consumers are, understandably, not convinced.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603762">In short, one problem remains: there is lack of transparency, hence the importance of the Bloc Québécois motion being presented today. We have to discipline the industry and ensure that no middlemen, the refineries for instance, take advantage of the circumstances. To do so, we propose giving the Competition Act more muscle. For a number of years now we have been calling for this legislation to be changed in order to give the Competition Bureau real investigative power. This bureau could initiate investigations and call witnesses. It could also ensure their protection and study all aspects of the oil industry and propose solutions. </ParaText><ParaText id="603763">We also propose the creation of a real petroleum monitoring agency. This agency would be responsible for overseeing the industry by collecting and disseminating price data on refined petroleum products for all North American markets, and drafting annual reports on the competitive aspects. To date, the federal government has always refused to do this. These measures I have just listed are solutions that could be applied in the short term.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603764">In the longer term, Quebec needs to take measures to reduce its dependence on oil. All the oil Quebec consumes is imported. In 2006, Quebec imported $13 billion worth of oil, which is up $7 billion in three years. At the same time, Quebec went from a trade surplus to a $7 billion deficit in 2006. The increase in the price of oil alone plunged Quebec into a trade deficit. Oil is making Quebec poorer. In the long term we have to invest in true alternative energies and launch a real initiative to reduce our consumption of oil for transportation, heating and industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="603765">Finally, I know that the Conservatives will not like these proposals but, in order to stop the oil industry from making us poorer as a society, we must redistribute resources and repeal the accelerated capital cost allowance for investments in the oil sands immediately when the price of crude exceeds a threshold of somewhere between $40 and $50. The government announced this measure in its last budget, but it will not come into effect for another three years. </ParaText><ParaText id="603766">We have to make the oil companies pay for the environmental damage they cause. Refusing to stick to the Kyoto protocol is not going to solve these problems.</ParaText>

							<ParaText id="603835">For those who are following this debate, I would ask that they really look at what all three opposition parties are calling for because this motion is a bit of a smokescreen. They brought in a motion showing that they would like some changes made to the price of gasoline when in fact every opposition party, the NDP, the Bloc and the Liberals, support a policy that would, without question, cause the price of gasoline to rise by at least 60%. </ParaText><ParaText id="603836">They do not like it. I can hear the moans and groans. Why do they not like it? It is because this number has been put out by some of the country's leading independent economists. Those are the facts. This was not just one economist, this was by some of the leading professors of various departments at universities from right across the country. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603837">It is important for Canadians to realize what all the other parties are pushing for. If they had their way, gasoline prices would rise to $1.60, $1.70 and then up to $2 a litre. That is unacceptable because that would cause serious harm to our economy, something that the Conservative government will not contemplate. We will use a balanced approach where we can ensure we have a strong economy and deliver real reductions for the environment, something that we are doing each and every day.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

How is it that the price of gas can jump every Thursday, just before the weekend, only to come back down on Monday, when everyone goes back to work? We must absolutely find out what is going on behind closed doors.</ParaText><ParaText id="603875">That is also the intention of the Bloc Québécois motion here today. The Bloc presented this motion in order to shed some light on gas prices, which are constantly going up, while no one understands why and we are left to imagine the schemes behind these increases.</ParaText><ParaText id="603876">The motion reads:</ParaText><ParaText id="603877"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentRest="1" IndentFirst="2">That, in the opinion of the House, the government should move an amendment to the Competition Act so that the Commissioner of Competition have the power to initiate investigations of the price of gas and the role of refining margins in the determination of the said price.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603878">As we all know, the price of gas results from adding the cost of four factors: the price of crude oil, the cost of refining, taxes and the retail margin. The concentration of refining activities during the 1990s caused an increase in prices. These increases are profitable to the oil companies, whose profits continue to grow astronomically. The public therefore has the right to know how these prices are calculated and, above all, what is behind the refining margin.</ParaText><ParaText id="603879">Prices are skyrocketing. Refining margins are three times too high. Oil companies are making obscene profits. Last week, the price at the pump for regular gas was $1.15, on average, in Quebec City. The average refining margin reached a record high at 23¢. That is three times too high, when we know that a profit of 5¢ to 7¢ is enough for the oil companies to earn a reasonable profit on refining. The price of petroleum products could remain high over the summer, especially since the cost of crude oil continues to rise.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603880">The oil companies pocket the profits. There are six major oil companies in Canada: Imperial Oil, Petro-Canada, Husky Oil, EnCana, Suncor and Shell. These companies had record profits of almost $12 billion in 2006, a 25% increase over 2005 and a 70% increase compared to 2004. Is there collusion? It is impossible to say. However, the five major oil companies supply 90% of the gas sold in Canada and get along so well that they even supply one another.</ParaText><ParaText id="603881">Therefore the oil sector must be brought into line. The whole economy is threatened by the increase in value of a strategic resource. The Bloc Québécois believes that it is possible to limit, at least in part, price increases for gas and other petroleum products. Given the record profits of oil companies in recent years, there is a transfer of wealth in the order of billions of dollars and that worries us. First, the industry must be regulated to ensure that the middleman does not take advantage of his position or circumstances.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603882">The Bloc Québécois is proposing measures to discipline the industry. First, it proposes to strengthen the Competition Act, which presently has some shortcomings. The Competition Bureau cannot undertake an investigation on its own unless it receives complaints or is requested to do so by the <Affiliation DbId="78770" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation>. The Competition Bureau is severely lacking in powers to undertake a general review of the industry. It cannot summon witnesses or guarantee their protection to get them to talk. It cannot ask for the release of documents. Without these tools, it is almost impossible to prove collusion or any other anti-competitive practices. Even in the case of agreements among competitors, the Competition Bureau bears the burden of proof for the collusion. the Competition Act must be strengthened by giving real investigative powers to the Competition Bureau. At the end of its mandate, the Liberal government tabled Bill <Document DbId="2012118" Type="3">C-66</Document>, which was based for the most part on a complete plan tabled one month earlier. The bill died on the order paper and the Conservatives did nothing.</ParaText><ParaText id="603883">To bring the industry into line, a real petroleum monitoring agency must be created. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp><ParaText id="603884">In its November 2003 report on the price of gas, the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology proposed the creation of a petroleum monitoring agency. It is quite incredible to think that the oil industry supported this initiative and the Conservatives were against it. The Conservatives are even more inflexible than the oil companies when it comes to defending the interests of the oil companies. They hardly need lobbyists, when they have the Conservative government.</ParaText><ParaText id="603885">To make it look as if it was doing something, the Liberal government—which was no better—set up an Internet site that gave the price of gas in major cities. It was just an Internet site. It did not conduct any study on the oil industry and was unable to recommend any course of action. In other words, it achieved nothing. It takes a real office to monitor this industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="603886">Oil is making Quebec poorer. We have to stop this bleeding. All the oil Quebec consumes is imported. Every litre it consumes is money out the window that makes the province poorer and the oil industry richer.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603887">In 2006, Quebec imported $13 billion worth of oil, an increase of $7 billion in three years. At the same time, Quebec went from a trade surplus to a $7 billion deficit in 2006, not to mention that the increase in Albertan oil exports made the dollar go up, which hit our manufacturing companies and further emphasized our trade deficit. The increase in the price of oil alone plunged Quebec into a trade deficit. Last year, every Quebecker consumed $1,000 more than he or she produced. Oil is making us poorer.</ParaText><ParaText id="603888">We have to redistribute resources in order to stop the oil industry from making our society poor. We have to impose a $500 million surcharge on the oil companies' profits. We have to repeal the accelerated capital cost allowance for investments in the oil sands, when the price of crude exceeds a threshold of somewhere between $40 and $50. The government announced this measure in its last budget, but it will not come into effect for another three years.</ParaText><ParaText id="603889">We have to repeal the changes made to the 2003 natural resources tax system, which allows oil companies to lower their taxes by another $250 million a year. We have to make the oil companies pay for the environmental damage they cause by establishing emissions caps, together with a carbon tax and a permit trading system.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603890">But in the long run, the solution is to reduce our dependence on oil.</ParaText><ParaText id="603891">Prices of petroleum products have been on the rise for several years. The figures I am going to quote come from the Régie de l'énergie du Québec. The price of crude oil is increasing and today is fluctuating between US$60 and US$62 a barrel. It has gone up 13% since the beginning of the year and 83% since the beginning of 2004. It is even exceeding the level reached in September 2005, when hurricanes in the southern United States pushed the price up to $69 a barrel.</ParaText><ParaText id="603892">The price of heating oil is also going up. It has averaged 70.7¢ since the beginning of 2007, up more than 10¢ or 20% over two years ago. According to Statistics Canada, roughly 500,000 households in Quebec still heat with oil or another liquid fuel.</ParaText><ParaText id="603893">The price of gas is rising. Two years ago, in April 2005, a new record was reached in Montreal when the price of regular gas topped $1. Fluctuations aside, gas prices in Quebec are rising steadily.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603894">Until we put measures in place, one by one, to decrease our dependence on oil, we need to clean house and find out who is making unfair profits. The government therefore must move an amendment to the Competition Act so that the Commissioner of Competition has the power to initiate investigations into the price of gas and the role of refining margins in determining gas prices.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. St-Cyr" id="2066989"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="79021" Type="2">Mr. Thierry St-Cyr (Jeanne-Le Ber, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="603912">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the motion introduced by my Bloc Québécois colleagues. I would like to begin my presentation with a little economics 101. The minister who spoke a little earlier today quoted some so-called great economics experts, telling us that if we were to implement the Kyoto protocol, the price of gas would skyrocket. We saw the <Affiliation DbId="78770" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> indulge in the same sort of accusations during the last election campaign, when he blamed environmentalists for high gas prices. We saw the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="78771" Type="4">Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities</Affiliation>—we have heard from nearly every Conservative—repeat the same old song and dance. Now, they are trying to justify all this with so-called serious economical analyses.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603913">We should have another look at the basics of economic and market concepts. I am surprised to hear remarks of this nature coming from the Conservatives, who are the so-called apostles of the free market and who are supposed to have full confidence in market forces. Today, they are repeating the same old song and dance. Why are they making these awful statements? Because, in economics, there is one basic principle: the law of supply and demand. I remember learning this principle as a child in school, in secondary IV in Quebec, in economics class. It is rather simple. There is the supply of a product and the demand of a product. When the supply of a product increases, prices drop and vice versa. As for demand, if the demand goes down, prices will obviously go up. If demand goes up, the price will drop. Actually, no, it is the other way around. Well, you get the idea.</ParaText><ParaText id="603914">My point is, the oil companies understand this law of economics very well. This is proven by the fact that, as the demand for petroleum increases in North America and around the world, we see oil companies close refineries in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Clearly, they are doing this in order to reduce the supply and drive prices up, thereby increasing their profits. They have understood this very well. When the time comes to meet the demand, this principle of supply and demand must apply.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603915">If we implement the Kyoto protocol, if we decrease our consumption of energy and oil, if we decrease demand, contrary to what the minister told us today and to what the entire government constantly repeats, prices will not increase. They cannot increase if demand decreases; the opposite will happen.</ParaText><ParaText id="603916">I was pleased to hear the member for <Affiliation DbId="78351" Type="2">Cambridge</Affiliation> confirm this just a few minutes ago when he told us that he believes that the only way to reduce the price is to decrease demand for oil. I find it difficult to understand how he can support a government that refuses to respect the Kyoto protocol whose ultimate objective is to decrease our consumption of and dependence on oil. There is a real problem: supply is too low and, above all, consumption is too high. We are also facing a situation where there is evidently a problem with competition.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603917">Once again, it is somewhat surprising to see the Conservatives put obstacles in the way of those who would like greater transparency and more competition, when they should be advocating for free markets and utter and complete competition. As a result, oil companies now have profit margins—just in refining—of 23¢, whereas most experts say that refining margins of 5¢ to 7¢ would be enough to guarantee reasonable profits.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp><ParaText id="603918">The factor we are discussing today is oil refining. We know that retailers are not making a fortune. They make just a few cents per litre. Competition among retailers is fierce—there are often three or four at a single intersection. </ParaText><ParaText id="603919">We also know that at the other end, at the first stage of production involving the crude oil market, prices are hard to control because we have no say in what happens on the world market. Then the oil is shipped here. Once again, we have little control over this factor. However, when it comes to refining, we do have some control over that.</ParaText><ParaText id="603920">Today, I was surprised to hear the minister answer our questions by saying, “Yes, but the refining margin in the U.S. is now 26¢”. Is knowing that the Americans are being swindled even more than we are supposed to comfort Quebeckers who buy gas and oil? That is not very good news, but obviously, his answer is not satisfactory. We need more than that. Let us be serious. We are talking about 23¢ on one part of the cost of gas. There are taxes, the cost of crude and transportation, and the retailer mark-up, but the problem is with the refining margins.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603921">In Canada, there is a near-monopoly on refining. For example, as my colleague explained earlier, there are six players in all of Canada. Six players controlling an entire market is not a lot. However, at a more local level, all of the oil in the Atlantic provinces is refined by the same company. In Montreal, there are two, and in Ontario, there is a certain number as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="603922">At the local market level, there are often very few players, perhaps even just one player, and oil companies get along so well that they sell oil to each other depending on their geographic location. It is clear to me that the motion we have introduced in the House today includes the bare minimum we can do to increase competition.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603923">What is the government afraid of? This motion is calling for greater powers of investigation to be given to the Commissioner of Competition. In past reports, the commissioner indicated that he did not have the authority to investigate this matter. On the one hand, he cannot initiate his own investigations and, on the other hand, he does not have the power to compel documents or to compel or protect witnesses. In a word, he does not have the powers necessary to do that kind of work.</ParaText><ParaText id="603924">The Conservatives claim that there is no problem. If that is so, if there is no collusion and no near-monopoly, why would the government oppose our motion? Our motion would expand the powers of the Commissioner of Competition, which he could use properly. If he conducted investigations and concluded from them that all is well—which I doubt, as do most motorists in Canada—then, the issue would be settled.</ParaText><ParaText id="603925">The reason the Conservatives oppose this motion is really because they do suspect a problem. They can well imagine that, if the commissioner investigated and had full power to do so, he would bring out to the open a situation that is far from ideal and clearly not to the advantage of consumers.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603926">Naturally, the short term solution is not only that this motion be adopted, but also that the government act on it and give more power to the Competition Bureau, and as soon as possible. In the medium and long term, the Kyoto objectives will have to be met and even exceeded for our consumption of oil to diminish, which in turn will reduce the demand for oil and the pressure on oil prices.</ParaText>

The members repeatedly have said that the Competition Bureau cannot initiate price fixing inquiries. As a matter of fact it can and it does, and it does so regularly. The bureau has secured numerous convictions for price fixing under the act. Over the last 15 years it has secured over $400 million in fines for price fixing.</ParaText><ParaText id="603943">The real issue here is about consumers and the Bloc cannot run from its record.

Crude oil has a limited ability to be refined within Canada and seems to move with the rapidity of lightning in its price range.</ParaText><ParaText id="603951">We have heard these complaints over and over again. We have seen inaction from the previous government because it had a laissez-faire attitude. Certainly, we would hope better from this government and in a minority government situation we would hope that the majority in the House would have the opportunity to make a difference.</ParaText><ParaText id="603952">Earlier today I spoke to reporters about the northern prosperity gap faced by working families across the north due to the high cost of living. High gasoline and energy prices are just two things that contribute to the high cost of living that northerners face on a regular basis.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603953">A little over two weeks ago I was back in my home town of Fort Smith, which is the most southern community in the Northwest Territories. It has excellent road access and the price of gasoline was $1.20 a litre. I received a phone call from my daughter last night and she was outraged at the fact that the price of gasoline at the pump had gone to $1.31. This community, located some 800 miles away from the Strathcona refinery in Alberta, had seen a larger increase than most other places.</ParaText><ParaText id="603954">To me this suggests something about petroleum monitoring agencies. It would be very important for this country to have an agency that could look at not just the price of gasoline in the large cities, but the smaller communities across Canada, in the north and rural Canada, the communities that do not have a plethora of gas stations that perhaps are competitive but have to deal with one or two outlets in their own particular communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="603955">The situation is that the price of gas goes up 5¢ in Edmonton and nothing has changed in Fort Smith. The cost of transporting the fuel there has not changed. The wages for the person in the gas station have not changed. However, the price in Fort Smith goes up twice as much as it does in Edmonton. This is intolerable in any situation. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603956">People expect that there would be some rationale in the pricing of a product that is delivered to their communities. In Parliament we should certainly look at ways to protect the consumer at all levels of society. I trust that a petroleum monitoring agency would have the opportunity to look at not only the larger picture but at the situations in various regions of the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="603957">Lower gas prices are something that all northerners want and I suppose all Canadians want as well. The NDP supports the effort to ensure that the day to day fluctuation in the price of gas is not conspiratorially exploited, that it is actually the cost of the product reflected in the price.</ParaText><ParaText id="603958">Every one of us in the country recognizes that oil is a world market commodity and will rise and fall, and that will cause changes in the price of the retail product. We can all accept that. We can all accept as well the deliberate act of government to ensure that we reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the development of hard targets over the next few years. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp><ParaText id="603959">Interestingly enough, a poll was done in Alberta and some 70% of Albertans were in favour of hard targets for emission reductions. That speaks well of Albertans who understand the industry and understand the enormous problems that industry will face in the future, but they are not giving up on it. Albertans are not like that. They do not give up on problems. They recognize them and work to solve them, I hope, in the future. The leadership we are hearing from Alberta, though, is far behind the people of Alberta.</ParaText><ParaText id="603960">Higher gas prices are a symptom of a much larger disease. It will be more and more apparent in Canada as time goes on. Really, to solve the larger problem, we need to look at a national energy strategy in this country. We need to look at how we deal with energy as a whole. We will not get to a situation of reduced emissions for Kyoto without it and we will certainly not control prices and control the economy as far as energy costs go without some kind of nationally recognized strategy with buy-in from all the provinces and territories.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603961">Recently, people in Ontario saw gas prices rise because a fire damaged part of a refinery. The fact that a fire at one refinery results in gas shortages and high prices shows a system for delivering fuel for consumers in trouble. There is no excess capacity and the likelihood of getting more excess capacity is limited.</ParaText><ParaText id="603962">We need to look at conservation. The primary goal of any national energy strategy today and into the future has to be conservation. </ParaText><ParaText id="603963">The government has come out with a number of solutions for climate change. One of them was renewable fuels. We are seeing an investment of $2.2 billion over seven years into renewable fuels. It is a great thing for farmers, a great thing for the agricultural industry, but not really a great thing for conservation. Renewable fuels are not part of a conservation cycle. They are part of a demand cycle. They will continue the demand. </ParaText><ParaText id="603964">The investment of $2.2 billion in conservation practices, in reducing the use of automobiles, the increase in public transit, the ability to change the way we are dealing with the movement of our goods, services and persons across this country is much more toward the conservation side.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603965">In fact, the jury is still out on the ability of renewable fuels to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, their ability to reduce smog in the cities and all these things. That part of the Conservative platform, although interesting and useful in some respects, is really not a conservation strategy and certainly the door is still wide open as to whether it is a useful tool in reducing air pollution or greenhouse gas emissions.</ParaText><ParaText id="603966">What we have is a situation where we are continuing the consumption orientated economy of this country, and that will not work. We know the world is running out of oil. We know that we are in a finite situation with oil and if we put it on a cost curve, we are rapidly approaching a point where the costs will escalate past many alternatives that are in place.</ParaText><ParaText id="603967">Where do we go with it? If we continue in the way that the Liberals set out 13 years ago on energy with a laissez-faire system, let the industry decide how much energy will develop, how it will move ahead, we will end up with situations like we have today.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603968">I will use natural gas as an example. It was very interesting to hear at the natural resources committee the other day that the president of the Canadian Gas Association admitted that by 2015 we will be looking at 20% of our supply from liquefied natural gas. This is an individual who represents the sale of natural gas through its distribution system. He is not trying to frighten customers away. He is facing the reality of the situation that we have incurred under the laissez-faire policies of the last 13 years.</ParaText>

There is a lot of trouble with that project. It is a $16 billion project. Imperial Oil is saying it is too much money and it looks like it is going to have to go to LNG for the supply. Interestingly enough, Exxon, the parent company is heavily involved with liquefied natural gas in Qatar. We have a situation where one of these multinationals has two conflicting interests on the supply of energy to Canada. Where do we as Canadians sit, with no input, with no direction? We are simply going to allow this to play out as it may.</ParaText>

What we saw in Venezuela recently was a complete state takeover of oil.</ParaText><ParaText id="603973">Within the national energy strategy there is the conservation and development of renewable energy. We heard the <Affiliation DbId="78751" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> talk about the great amount of renewable energy that the government has promised. Four thousand megawatts sounds like a lot but it is not really.</ParaText><ParaText id="603974">The Canadian Wind Energy Association says that there are 100,000 megawatts of wind energy available to the existing grid within distance of the existing transmission system. That is renewable energy. There is hydro power and the opportunities for much more use of solar energy. Our solar energy ability is great. </ParaText><ParaText id="603975">On biomass, we are facing a crisis in the forests where our product is being downgraded. The bugs and climate change effects are destroying our forests. We need an active forest program. We need to move more heavily into biomass energy.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="603976">Part of that would be an east-west energy grid. We need to link this country together so that it works better for renewable energy. There is no way we can operate in isolation as we have province to province in dealing with energy. We need a national strategy. We need to move ahead with this.</ParaText><ParaText id="603977">We can sit here and talk about reducing greenhouse gas emissions for four years or ten years, but without a national energy strategy that changes the way we use energy, we will not achieve those larger targets that are coming in 10, 15 or 20 years.</ParaText><ParaText id="603978">This is a good idea, a petroleum monitoring agency, using the Competition Bureau to ensure that Canadians have some trust in what they are doing, but this is only part of the picture.

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Van Kesteren" id="2067262"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78511" Type="2">Mr. Dave Van Kesteren (Chatham-Kent—Essex, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="604003">Mr. Speaker, before I get started on my remarks, I would like to say hello to my mother, 87 years old, who has been ailing of late and is doing much better. They say behind that every successful man there is a surprised mother-in-law, but behind my mother there are 10 children, 60 grandchildren and 70 great-grandchildren, and we are all glad that she is still with us.</ParaText><ParaText id="604004"> I am pleased to speak to Bill <Document DbId="2166075" Type="4">C-299</Document>. This bill was introduced by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78709" Type="2">Edmonton—Leduc</Affiliation>. It was supported at second reading and referred to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights.</ParaText><ParaText id="604005">In February, the committee heard from the sponsor. During clause by clause consideration, the committee also heard from witnesses from the Department of Justice. Those discussions were very fruitful.</ParaText><ParaText id="604006">The objective of Bill <Document DbId="2166075" Type="4">C-299</Document> is oriented toward a particular problem, specifically the practice which is commonly known as pretexting. Pretexting is the act of getting people to reveal personal information by various kinds of deception. </ParaText><ParaText id="604007">In this case, the sponsor of the bill was particularly interested in the obtaining of information about people by deception of other parties. The bill was focused on deception generally and also specifically on deception that takes the form of impersonating another person.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="604008">For example, there are many reported instances of people calling a telephone company and pretending to be a subscriber. The caller then asks for the subscriber's phone records. The telephone company, believing the caller to be an actual subscriber, releases the records. The caller then obtains the records, which reveal a significant amount of information about the subscriber.</ParaText><ParaText id="604009"> This kind of practice can be a flagrant violation of privacy. It is also a tool used by identity thieves to obtain identity information that can be used to impersonate the subscriber in a range of different contexts. </ParaText><ParaText id="604010">In its original form, the bill amended the Criminal Code, the Competition Act and the Canada Evidence Act. It created new offences and other measures designed to address this form of pretexting conduct.</ParaText><ParaText id="604011">The justice committee of the House heard that there were some concerns with the bill as it was originally drafted. One set of concerns related to the offences that were proposed for enactment in the Criminal Code. For instance, as originally drafted, Bill <Document DbId="2166075" Type="4">C-299</Document> would have created offences that criminalize the very act of obtaining personal information by deception of some kind, without anything more.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="604012">I mentioned previously that this kind of act can be a privacy intrusion or it can be the first step to an identity theft enterprise, but there are also legitimate circumstances in which deception is used.</ParaText><ParaText id="604013"> For instance, deception is a legitimate investigative technique used by police. Undercover police are constantly deceiving the targets of their investigation as to their true identity, all with a view to obtaining evidence against those targets. Outside of the undercover context, the police can also use deception when they interview suspects.</ParaText><ParaText id="604014">There are many other legitimate circumstances in which people use deception to obtain information. Investigative journalists likely employ such techniques when they are tracking down a story. Although it may be distasteful to think about, it is probably also the case that parents, friends and spouses sometimes tell each other lies in order to uncover information.</ParaText><ParaText id="604015">Simply put, lying is not sufficient to amount to a crime. All of this is to say that the original wording of the offences proposed in Bill <Document DbId="2166075" Type="4">C-299</Document> was too broad. It captured too many circumstances by also criminalizing deception that is undertaken for legitimate or non-harmful purposes.</ParaText><ParaText id="604016">I believe the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78709" Type="2">Edmonton—Leduc</Affiliation> was in agreement with this assessment. As a result, the committee, with the sponsor's approval, amended those proposed criminal offences by adding an additional component.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="604017">Simply put, the additional requirement is an intent to use the information obtained to impersonate the person or to defraud someone. In the criminal law context, people obtain other people's information in order to use it to impersonate them. This is what is commonly referred to as identity theft.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp><ParaText id="604018"> Using another person's information like a key, the identity thief can then access their financial or bank accounts, sell their property, make purchases on their credit card, and so on.</ParaText><ParaText id="604019">While the acts of impersonating and defrauding someone are already criminal offences, the act of obtaining the necessary identifying information is not a crime, even where that is done for the sole purpose of using the information to commit an offence.</ParaText><ParaText id="604020">Following this logic, the committee adopted the offences that were proposed in Bill <Document DbId="2166075" Type="4">C-299</Document> by adding a criminal intention to use the information to impersonate or to defraud someone. The result is an offence that criminalizes the deception as a tool of identity theft. At the same time, the offence would not criminalize lying in other contexts where there is no intention to later use the information to commit another crime. This makes sense.</ParaText><ParaText id="604021">By criminalizing for the first time one technique that is frequently used by identity thieves, Bill <Document DbId="2166075" Type="4">C-299</Document>, as amended by the committee, is a significant step forward for our criminal law and should be applauded.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="604022">However, the committee acknowledged that the offences, even as they were amended, did not completely address the problem of identity theft.</ParaText><ParaText id="604023">There are other tactics that identity thieves use to collect valuable information, such as rifling through garbage, hacking into computer databases, and watching over a person's shoulder as they use their cards. These methods do not rely on deception. As a result, Bill <Document DbId="2166075" Type="4">C-299</Document> does not make these acts criminal. The committee recognized that Bill C-299 does not comprehensively address the issue of identity theft but viewed it as a good first step, and I would certainly agree.</ParaText><ParaText id="604024">In this regard, I would like to take the opportunity to remind members that the Department of Justice has been working on proposals to amend the Criminal Code to deal with the full range of identity theft situations. I understand that this work is ongoing. I hope that we will see more comprehensive government legislation in this area in the future.</ParaText><ParaText id="604025">The committee made a number of other changes to the proposed new Criminal Code offences. For instance, it replaced the definition of personal information that was previously provided. The original definition was the same as the definition from the Personal Identification and Protection of Electronic Documents Act, known as PIPEDA. That definition is “information about an identifiable individual”. This definition is suitable for a statute such as PIPEDA, which is designed to protect the privacy of personal information.</ParaText><ParaText id="604026">However, privacy is not the primary focus of an identity theft law. Identity theft is about protecting a person's identity from being falsely used, not about protecting privacy for its own sake, although privacy protection is certainly enhanced by identity theft laws. A definition which includes any information about a person is too broad for an identity theft offence because a lot of information that is about people is not useful for impersonating them. For instance, the initial definition would have included information like shopping preferences, a person's religion or height, and an infinite amount of other information. None of these types of information are relevant to identity theft.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="604027">The type of information that is pertinent to an identity theft law is information that is capable of identifying a person. This is a much narrower case of information than information that is about a person. For this reason, and again with the consent of the sponsor, the committee replaced the definition originally in the bill with a definition more suitable to the context.</ParaText><ParaText id="604028">Another change the committee made to the proposed Criminal Code offences was to expand the scope of the offences so they would cover not just the use of deception to get information from third parties, such as a telephone company, but so it captured the use of deception to get information from any person. This change means the use of deception to get a person to reveal identifying information about themselves would also be an offence. This makes good sense. We know that identity thieves do in fact get information directly from the people they intend to impersonate.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="604029">Phishing attacks are a good example. A phishing attack is an unsolicited email which falsely appears to be from a legitimate banking or other type of institution. It asks the recipient to provide valuable identifying or financial information, which the identity thieves then use. Phishing scams do not deceive third parties into revealing information; they deceive the victims directly. Bill <Document DbId="2166075" Type="4">C-299</Document> has been reported back to the House in a form that would now capture this behaviour.</ParaText><ParaText id="604030">There were other elements of the original bill. There was a proposal to amend the Canada Evidence Act and proposals to amend the Competition Act.</ParaText><ParaText id="604031">With the agreement of the hon. member who introduced the legislation, the proposal that would have amended the Canada Evidence Act was deleted from the bill. Those proposals that pertained to the Competition Act were also deleted. It was suggested that the issues raised by those proposals would be raised with the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics for consideration as part of its legislative review of the PIPEDA legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="604032">I thank the members of the committee for their detailed consideration of the bill and for their amendments to it, which I believe improve the legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="604033">I again commend the hon. member who tabled Bill <Document DbId="2166075" Type="4">C-299</Document>, which represents an important first step in the battle against identity theft.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I will speak very briefly on the matter because I think it is a subject that all Canadians should be concerned with, and it is fitting that the House of Commons is seized of the issue today.</ParaText><ParaText id="604040">I am not sure that all Canadians realize the magnitude and the scope of this problem. Today in testimony at the access to information, privacy and ethics committee we heard that it is estimated there are roughly 30 million incidents of identity theft or breaches of personal information in the United States per year, which could lead to identity theft. In fact, there were 104 million incidents in the last three years.</ParaText><ParaText id="604041">Coupled with the initiative by my colleague from Edmonton, Bill <Document DbId="2166075" Type="4">C-299</Document>, our committee has undertaken a comprehensive study and analysis. We will be doing a full review and study of identity theft in all its forms. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="604042">One of the things that comes to mind, and people who are following this subject might be interested in this, is the justice committee has also been dealing with the issue. I believe my colleague, the justice critic for the NDP, was aware of this. Back in February, it submitted a report to the House of Commons, urging the<Affiliation DbId="105824" Type="4"> Minister of Justice</Affiliation> to amend the Criminal Code to include identity theft as a separate item under the Criminal Code, thus recognizing the severity of the problem in society.</ParaText><ParaText id="604043">We heard evidence from the Privacy Commissioner today. She tried to give some definition to a problem that is abstract in nature and poorly understood by so many. I do not think people realize the number of ways identity theft is being planned and implemented as we speak. There are people out there with great technical skills who are busily engaging themselves in identity theft now, not always resulting in injury to a Canadian but it should still be considered a crime in the context of the RCMP looking into it.</ParaText><ParaText id="604044">One of the assistants to the Privacy Commissioner currently is a former deputy commissioner of the RCMP specializing in identity theft. We take some comfort that we are well served with expertise, watching out for our best interests in this regard. However, they are wrestling with how we might better protect Canadians from this problem.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="604045">One of the more egregious examples that came forward in testimony today is the situation, which happens from time to time in our country and in the United States, where houses are sold right out from underneath people, without them realizing it. Unwittingly and unknowingly to them, someone has usurped their identity, gone through the motions and actually sold their homes. The titles have been transferred and they are sitting in homes that they thought were theirs, but they have been stolen from them. That is perhaps one of more glaring or shocking examples, but people should be taking that seriously.</ParaText><ParaText id="604046">We note the commissioner of privacy in the United Kingdom has just issued a report on this issue of identity theft and uses the word “shocking” at some of the revelations of the criminal activity going on in that country. One of the more shocking things they have uncovered and revealed to us, and that we have taken note of, is the fact there are moles willing to sell information to undercover police or undercover journalists, as was exposed in that country, in virtually every aspect of the financial sector. They are willing to sell personal information for the purposes of illegal activity and identity theft.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp><ParaText id="604047">It can be through phishing attacks or fake bank e-mails, which is another one Canadians should be cautious of. It has been brought to our attention that people are getting phony e-mails, using the banner and the template of a local bank, asking them to please verify their bank account numbers and their pin numbers so the bank can double check to ensure everything is on the up and up. Those are fraudulent messages but they are so professionally executed that even people who are cautious of identity theft in their personal information are falling for this and are sending their most highly protected personal information to these individuals with sometimes tragic results.</ParaText><ParaText id="604048">There are robots, Bots, circulating throughout the IT sector, Trojans and worms that creep into the electronic systems. On a cautionary note, people must become aware of and be cautious of the Facebook and MySpace domains, especially young people, because there are people trolling through that database of information for the purposes of identity theft.</ParaText><ParaText id="604049">If there are 30 million people per year whose personal information is being compromised by people who would and could use this identity theft to inflict financial injury on us, just by sheer ratio and proportion, we could safely say that there are roughly three millions Canadians per year who are suffering this. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="604050">The reason I raise this and the reason I wanted to intervene today is that it is wrong that companies are not required to notify individuals if their personal information has been compromised. Companies have no obligation or duty to notify people in the case of a breach.</ParaText><ParaText id="604051">Even if I did not suffer any financial loss, if my personal information and my privacy were compromised, I would want to know because I may choose to change where I am doing business if its security network is so lax that once, twice or ten times my personal information has been compromised.</ParaText><ParaText id="604052">One of the recommendations of the committee which just did a statutory review of the PIPEDA legislation, the personal information protection legislation, was that there must be a duty and an obligation on the company to notify people, whether it is the credit card company or the bank that has lost the records or whatever, that their information has been compromised.</ParaText><ParaText id="604053">We are taking this very seriously. Bill <Document DbId="2166075" Type="4">C-299</Document>, or what is left of it, would only help us in one aspect of all that needs to be done. It does in fact call for the Criminal Code to be amended so that identification information obtained by fraud or false pretence would be a stand-alone offence.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="604054">It has always struck me as odd that it is a stand-alone offence to steal a cow but it is not a stand-alone offence to steal an automobile for instance, and it is not a stand-alone offence to engage in this criminal activity which is very much a sign of the times and one that was never contemplated when the Martin's Criminal Code was put together. However, it is a much more pervasive problem today than a lot of Canadians realize.</ParaText><ParaText id="604055">We are not trying to upset people or to cause a panic. We believe that, by and large, our financial institutions do provide adequate security but if there are creative and highly skilled technical people who are looking for every opportunity possible to penetrate whatever security walls might have been put up in order to gain access to our personal information for nefarious reasons, we must to take this seriously. If we do nothing else in this particular area, in this particular Parliament, we should be able to tell Canadians that we are seized with this issue and that we will do all we can to protect their financial and personal information.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Rajotte" id="2067286"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78709" Type="2">Mr. James Rajotte (Edmonton—Leduc, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="604056">Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all my colleagues who spoke to this bill. I appreciate all of their interventions right from second reading through to the justice committee and to this debate here. My hope, obviously, is that this bill will pass, and I do have reason to believe that it may pass third reading, which is quite an achievement for a private member's bill. I am certainly very proud of that.</ParaText><ParaText id="604057">In my five minutes I want to summarize what the bill is about. It is an attempt to address one part of the problem of identity theft. Identity theft is a problem that is growing in our country, especially with a lot of the new technology, computers, e-mails, and the information that people give out electronically, whether they save it or transmit it, and with the companies that keep it. </ParaText><ParaText id="604058">The fact is that this has caused, in part, a lot of ease in terms of transactions and doing business but, unfortunately, it has led to a lot of people, with motives that are certainly less than wholesome, to take this information and, in certain cases, use it against these people.</ParaText><ParaText id="604059">Unfortunately, the Criminal Code has not been up to speed in terms of dealing with stealing a person's identity. My initiative here is to address one part of it called pretexting. As members have pointed out, pretexting, which is essentially pretending to be someone that I am not, to obtain identification information and then using that for criminal purposes. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="604060">I do want to point out the process. As members pointed out, I did start with personal information as it was in the Privacy Act. However, members of the justice department convinced me that it was better to use identification information. It was better to say criminal intent in the bill so that someone was not just collecting this information so they would not be caught under this legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="604061">I think this is actually an example of a case where the process of Parliament worked when going from second reading to the justice committee. The bill was amended and supported unanimously by the justice committee. It was then sent back to the House for report stage and third reading. In fact, members from all sides of the House have had their input into the bill and have improved the bill. I thank all members for that, especially the <Affiliation DbId="78963" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice</Affiliation> who was outstanding in terms of all the work he did. I thank members from all parties for their input.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="604062">Often in the House we criticize government officials and bureaucrats. I do want to say that in this case the two people from the justice department, William Bartlett and Joanne Klineberg, were exceptional in terms of helping to improve the bill in terms of changing the definition from personal information to identification information and in terms of explaining what the government was doing in terms of looking at identity theft in a broader way. </ParaText><ParaText id="604063">I think it is correct what members have said in the sense that this is one part of the issue of identity theft. The problem needs to be addressed in a very comprehensive way. I am very glad that the government is actually looking at that and seriously looking to bringing forward a comprehensive package very soon on that initiative.</ParaText><ParaText id="604064">I want to re-emphasize for people what the bill is about. It is about dealing with pretexting, pretending to be someone that we are not, obtaining that information and then using that information and selling it online. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="604065">I should compliment and credit the Privacy Commission, Jennifer Stoddart. I do want to tip my hat to <I>Maclean's</I> magazine because this bill started with me reading an article in <I>Maclean's</I> back in 2005 where the personal telephone records of our own Privacy Commissioner had been obtained by someone over the Internet. The magazine had obtained them from someone called the data broker, who is someone who collects this information and sells it. The genesis of this bill and the idea really started there and so I should credit <I>Maclean's</I>. I also want to credit the Privacy Commissioner for helping with the bill and commenting on it as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="604066">I hope the bill does receive the unanimous support of the House, goes to the Senate and becomes law. It would be a big step forward in terms of addressing identity theft.</ParaText><ParaText id="604067">I also want to encourage the government to proceed with its plans to address the comprehensive package that addresses identity theft in general, recognizing the seriousness of the problem and the fact that Canadians deserve to have their identities protected.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

A number of contributing factors have created a veritable perfect storm for tobacco farmers.</ParaText><ParaText id="604077"> In 2002 they were advised by tobacco companies to reinvest heavily in sophisticated new machinery, which is now of little use to them as production has dropped off very substantially. In total, tobacco farmers, and there are only hundreds of them, invested $65 million to keep their industry and their livelihoods afloat. As well, over the past several years both levels of government have introduced legislation and programs to effectively shut down the tobacco industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="604078">While governments have properly educated consumers about the perils of smoking, governments have continued to benefit from the sale of tobacco, bringing in approximately $9 billion each year in taxes levied on tobacco products. Additionally, with an increase in illegal and contraband cigarettes entering the Canadian market, tobacco producers are unable to financially compete any longer.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="604079">Before the government was elected, its members called on the government at that time to provide a suitable buyout package to farmers. In 2004, for instance, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78523" Type="2">Haldimand—Norfolk</Affiliation>, now the <Affiliation DbId="105834" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship and Immigration</Affiliation>, criticized the then Liberal government's program as too cheap in providing $71 million to tobacco producers. Yet after 15 months of governing, not a single cent has been provided by the government to tobacco farmers.</ParaText><ParaText id="604080">The harsh reality is tobacco farmers are in a severe financial crisis and a comprehensive exit strategy has been promised to them for some several months. It is time for the federal government to act, not to talk. The so-called high level meetings have gone on and on and the discussions are becoming circular with no apparent end in sight. The federal government should and must commit immediately to a solid exit strategy for tobacco producers and must stop talking about yet another round of talks.</ParaText><ParaText id="604081">Precedents have been set in other tobacco producing countries. Exit strategies have been provided, for instance, to tobacco farmers in both Australia and the United States. It is time that Canadian tobacco farmers received similar fair treatment.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="604082">On March 8 of this year I received a letter from the <Affiliation DbId="78749" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food</Affiliation> stating, “The sector's difficulties remain an important concern to Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada”. Is that concern, I ask? Nothing was provided in the budget for the hundreds of tobacco farmers who are in very desperate straits. On March 22, the minister stated in the House that he, “realized the very difficult situation for tobacco growers, especially in Ontario”.</ParaText><ParaText id="604083">When does the minister intend to demonstrate real leadership, real concern for the tobacco farmers and provide a buyout package for them?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I can assure the House that the situation facing Ontario's flue-cured tobacco growers is of concern to the government.</ParaText><ParaText id="604087">The government understands that significant declines in demand have occurred for Ontario's flue-cured tobacco and that the province's 1,559 flue-cured quota holders anticipate further reductions in demand for this year's crop.</ParaText><ParaText id="604088">We understand the serious circumstances that tobacco growers are faced with. In fact we have provided a number of programs to assist tobacco growers in the past. </ParaText><ParaText id="604089">In 2005 the tobacco industry was assisted through the tobacco adjustment assistance program. Entry requirements were also altered to ensure that tobacco producers would be eligible for the Canadian agricultural skills service program which provides producers with access to skills development and learning opportunities. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="604090">In addition, the government continues to provide assistance to tobacco producers through business risk management tools, such as CAIS, the production insurance program, spring credit advance programs and the advance payments program.</ParaText><ParaText id="604091">Last year the Ontario Flue-Cured Tobacco Growers' Marketing Board did bring forward a buyout proposal in which they were asking for $1 billion. This proposal was seen as being too expensive, as this level of support would better fit the entire agricultural sector. Recently the board has resubmitted a reduced proposal of $711 million.</ParaText><ParaText id="604092">The reduced level of funding sought by the board is also too high and it continues to be difficult to justify providing $711 million to 650 producers who are representing 1,559 flue-cured quota holders when many other producers in the agriculture industry are also facing very serious difficulties.</ParaText><ParaText id="604093">However, the minister understands the hardships facing the tobacco sector today. He will continue to work at identifying practical ways to help the tobacco sector. He will do so in collaboration with other federal departments, the central agencies and the Government of Ontario. In doing so, we need to and will consider all existing and proposed programming in the context of the entire agricultural sector.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It was in February of this year that the minister announced, not in this chamber, that the $1 billion buyout was, to use the minister's phrasing, “too expensive”.</ParaText><ParaText id="604096">The minister has not yet provided a definite response to tobacco growers as to what the government intends to do.

I understand these women are his constituents, so he has brought this issue to Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="604113">This government takes very seriously its responsibility for the safety and security of its citizens abroad. Whenever Canadians are victims of a tragedy outside Canada, there is understandably a great deal of public interest and concern. This government shares that concern.</ParaText><ParaText id="604114">When a Canadian is murdered abroad, consular officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs have an important role to assist the family of the victim. We have more than 270 points of service around the world to provide consular assistance to families dealing with these tragic situations. In the case of the Ianiero murders, our honorary consul in Cancun arrived on the scene within hours of the murder to provide consular support and assistance to the family. </ParaText><ParaText id="604115">As the hon. member knows, this government takes crimes against Canadians abroad very seriously. The role and the mandate of the Department of Foreign Affairs is to ensure that local police authorities actively investigate crimes against Canadian citizens.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="604116"> As soon as we are advised that a Canadian citizen is the victim of a crime outside Canada, consular officials immediately contact local authorities to register our concern and to ensure that they are aware of the crime. Canada expects that all crimes against Canadians, wherever they occur, will be thoroughly investigated by local authorities and that due process will take place.</ParaText><ParaText id="604117">In the Ianiero case, consular officials were immediately in contact with Mexican authorities to insist on a thorough investigation and to emphasize our desire to see that the perpetrators of this terrible crime are brought to justice. However, it is the sole responsibility of the authorities in the foreign country to investigate the crime. Canadian officials have neither the mandate nor the jurisdiction to investigate this crime, or indeed any crime, perpetrated against Canadians outside Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="604118">In some cases, we may receive a formal request from a foreign government for assistance with a particular criminal investigation. This initiative must be taken by the foreign government, not Canada. In the Ianiero case, the RCMP received a formal request for assistance from the Mexican authorities. </ParaText><ParaText id="604119">The RCMP and other Canadian law enforcement agencies continue to follow up on elements of the investigation here in Canada. However, the murder investigation remains the responsibility of the Mexican authorities.</ParaText><ParaText id="604120">I can assure the House that we will continue to follow developments on this case closely, as we do with all such cases where Canadian interests are concerned.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="604121">The <Affiliation DbId="78752" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> met with Ms. Everall and Ms. Kim last December to hear their concerns. They raised the fact that their names had been mentioned several times by the Mexican attorney general responsible for the investigation. They asked for the minister's assistance to clear their names. The minister advised them that while it is possible under the Canadian system for investigative authorities to state publicly that certain individuals are no longer of interest as part of an investigation, he was unaware of a similar practice in Mexico. He also advised that it was likely that they would need to wait for charges to be laid before such a statement could be asked from the Mexicans.</ParaText><ParaText id="604122">Ms. Everall and Ms. Kim also expressed concerns that their names could be placed on a no-fly list by Mexican officials and that they could be sent to Mexico to face criminal proceedings. The minister stated, and I can confirm again today, that we are not aware of any criminal charges against either Ms. Everall or Ms. Kim.</ParaText><ParaText id="604123">We will continue to ensure that this case is brought to the highest level of the Mexican government. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="78752" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> continuously bring this issue up with the Mexican authorities to ensure this investigation proceeds expeditiously.

Today, there has been another casualty in Mexico. How many more will it take before a travel advisory is issued?</ParaText><ParaText id="604126">The parliamentary secretary mentioned that they were no longer prime suspects, yet only a few weeks ago, on prime time television, the <I>W-FIVE</I> program showed the Mexican authorities identifying Dr. Cheryl Everall and Kimberly Kim as the prime suspects.</ParaText><ParaText id="604127">He mentions the honorary consul, yet none of us have had contact with this gentleman, and neither have the people we are talking about.

As the government moves forward, it has refused to work in a conciliatory fashion. This was reflected in the Kelowna accord, which it has absolutely dismissed, and also reflected in the past government's commitment to first nations in the first nations-federal Crown political accord. Recognition and implementation of first nations governance is the key.</ParaText><ParaText id="604163">In fact, when we speak about matrimonial real property, there is no consultation.
