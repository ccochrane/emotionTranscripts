Second reading</ProceduralText><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Karygiannis" id="2397855"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78401" Type="2">Hon. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough—Agincourt, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1001688">Mr. Speaker, it is indeed nice to be the first one up on this Friday morning.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001689"> It is with a heavy heart that I am participating in this debate on Bill <Document DbId="3354384" Type="3">C-50</Document>. For years the Department of Citizenship and Immigration has been struggling to keep up with the number of applications submitted from people who want to come to Canada. However, it would be worthwhile to take a historical look at this department over the last two decades. It has always had its difficulties; however, in the last two years it has been totally dysfunctional. Conservative minister after Conservative minister has tried to resolve the problems they are facing, yet they are finding themselves in more trouble.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001690">I am not going to say that under the Liberals the department was perfect. It had its challenges. However, in the last two years, the department has become the challenge.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001691"> When the Liberals took office in 1993, we inherited a country that was in total chaos and almost bankrupt. The inflation rate was running amok. The deficit was $42 billion and we had a debt to the tune of $600 billion-plus dollars.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001692">We had such a bad credit rating at that time that it drove international investors and creditors away in hordes. Not only did it drive creditors and investors away, it also deterred prospective immigrants from wanting to apply to come to Canada. In 1993, we had an inventory of almost 50,000 applications from people waiting to come to Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="1001693">However, over the years the situation in Canada changed and times became better. The annual deficit was no longer around. We started paying down the debt. For the first time in a few decades, Canada started having surpluses and the good times were here again under the Liberals. Our credit rating went up and investors started investing in Canada again.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001694">As Canada started attracting investors and money from overseas, we also started attracting new immigrants and more applications, applications by the thousands. Canada became a destination of choice for most immigrants. Many immigrants could have chosen to emigrate to the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany or Australia, just to name a few. However, many of these people chose Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="1001695">The rest is history. Our inventory application levels increased. Waiting times started to become longer. People had to wait a few years in order to come to Canada and start their new lives. However, people waited patiently, and even to this day people are willing to wait a little longer in order to come to their first choice of destination.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001696">Just recently, a few weeks ago, I travelled to India and met with many people: university students, professionals and business people. They expressed to me that their first choice of place to emigrate was Canada. Although it would still take a few years before they could emigrate to Canada, they told me it was still worth the wait. </ParaText><ParaText id="1001697">Let us fast-forward to today and examine the department under the Conservatives, especially under their two ministers. Under the previous minister, we had a department that came under a lot of strain when the crisis in Lebanon occurred. The then minister of citizenship and immigration and his counterpart, the then minister of foreign affairs, totally botched the evacuation of Canadian citizens from Lebanon.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001698">Then the Conservatives started fearmongering that we were evacuating people who had no business to be evacuated, and that these people, although claiming to have residency in Canada, returned to Lebanon as soon as things were good again. Reports were slipped to the media about thousands of people who returned to Lebanon, people, they said, who should not have been evacuated. </ParaText><ParaText id="1001699">The real truth, however, was the fact that the protocols developed in the departments, under the Liberals, to look after Canadians and their loved ones abroad when a natural or a man-made disaster occurs were completely ignored and misplaced. The Conservative ministers were running around like a bunch of chickens with their heads cut off and did not know what to do.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001700">During the Liberal regime, there were protocols in place such that should there be a natural or a man-made disaster, the Department of Citizenship and Immigration was ready to respond. Let us look at some examples. Under the Liberals, when the tsunami struck in South and Southeast Asia, family class applications were expedited and placed at the front of the line. Similarly, when the earthquake struck in Muzaffarabad, Pakistan, these protocols were put in place, and again family class applications were expedited.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001701">However, when the man-made disaster occurred in Lebanon, the Conservative ministers were slow to react and the tested protocols were shelved and ignored. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> even went to Cyprus to pick up a few stranded Canadians. If someone were to ask me, this was an expensive photo op.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="05">(1005)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1001702">Then we had the disaster of the lost Canadians. The minister and her department's officials mismanaged that particular file.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001703"> They even went so as far as to mislead the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration. When the minister and the deputy minister came in front of the committee, I asked them if they had advertised about Canadians who might have lost their citizenship. Both the minister and the deputy minister went on to mislead and outright distort the truth by saying that they had advertised in different media outlets on this matter. When a few days later they were pushed to reveal facts and figures, the minister and her deputy sent a letter of explanation to the committee admitting that they had given us false information about advertising.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001704">The mockery of this department under the Conservatives continues even today. A few months ago, I asked under the access to information about the real figures in inventories and waiting times since the Conservatives took power. The real nightmare was then exposed. The question posed was:</ParaText><ParaText id="1001705"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">With regard to Immigration Applications for each Canadian High Commission, Embassy and Consulate around the world, present and for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006, in actual numbers:</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1001706"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">(a) How many Spousal Sponsorships, Parental Sponsorships and Independent Applicant cases are or were in inventory;</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1001707"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">(b) What is or was the length of time required to process these applications--Spousal Sponsorships, Parental Sponsorships and Independent Applicants?</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1001708">The Conservative government had assured parliamentarians that processing times would decrease. Instead of seeing an overall decrease in processing timelines, what I discovered was an overall increase.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001709">I was able to determine a decrease in processing times and the number of cases in the regions of Europe and South America, but a dramatic increase in processing times and the number of cases in the regions of the world such as the Middle East, East Asia and South Asia.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001710">Close to 50% of our total inventory of applications comes from seven countries. To be exact, Beijing contributes 6.45% of our total applications; Colombo, 1.29%; Damascus, 5.27%; Hong Kong, 6.66%; Islamabad, 6.16%; New Delhi, 18.87%; and Manila 1.7%. Exactly, that is 46.51%.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001711">During the last two years of the Conservative regime, the number of cases decreased by 1.93% and the time processing has increased by 20.79%.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001712">Here are some of these nightmares. For Colombo, skilled workers' processing timelines increased by 53.65%, and parents' and grandparents' processing timelines increased by 36.36%. While the processing timelines in Colombo have gone up overall by 20.83%, the amount of processed cases has dropped by 1.74%.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001713">Beijing is the real nightmare. Skilled workers' processing timelines increased by 36.17%, spouses' and partners' processing timelines increased by 25%, and dependent children's timelines increased by 33.33%, while the amount of cases processed dropped by 4.07%. Parents' and grandparents' processing timelines increased by 54.54%, while the amount of cases processed dropped by 29.68%. Overall, in Beijing the processing timelines increased by 40.78%, while the amount of cases processed dropped by 48.05%.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001714">For Damascus, skilled workers' processing timelines have increased by 20%, and parents' and grandparents' processing timelines increased by 11.76%.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001715">For Hong Kong, skilled workers' processing timelines increased by 25.45%, while applications dropped by 6%. Parents' and grandparents' processing timelines increased by 28.57%. In Hong Kong, while the processing timelines went up by 10.28%, the processed cases dropped by 28%.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001716">For Islamabad, skilled workers' processing timelines increased by 43.18%, and parents' and grandparents' processing timelines increased by 8.1%.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001717">For New Delhi, skilled workers' processing times increased by 38%, and spouses and partners' processing timelines increased by 66.66%, while the amount of cases processed has dropped by 10%. For dependent children, processing timelines increased by 66.67%, while parents' and grandparents' processing timelines increased by 21.62%. Overall in New Delhi, processing timelines increased by 11.45%.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1001718">In Manila, parent's and grandparents' processing timelines increased by 51.85%. Overall, processing timelines increased by 5.88%.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001719">Finally, the minister finally had a revelation. She noticed that the train had run away and that she needed to do something. What to do? What to do? Let us ask the bureaucrats, it was decided, and here comes the nightmare: some bright individual wanting to have a quick passage of the legislation placed it in the budget and called it a motion of confidence. </ParaText><ParaText id="1001720">Let us examine what this piece of legislation, Bill <Document DbId="3354384" Type="3">C-50</Document>, will do specifically. I will be very brief, because other people before me have examined what is in store for us under this legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001721">This legislation has amendments that would give the <Affiliation DbId="105834" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship and Immigration</Affiliation> unilateral authority to determine priorities for processing immigration applications and requests.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001722"> Bill <Document DbId="3354384" Type="3">C-50</Document> puts too much power in the hands of the minister to cherry-pick the kinds of immigrants that the Conservative Party would find acceptable. It eliminates the right of every application to be given fair review and consideration, regardless of background, country of origin or skill set. The amendments put no limit on the minister's new discretionary powers to make them consistent with existing federal-provincial immigration regulations.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001723">The minister would have wide-ranging new powers allowing him or her to give the following instructions with respect to the processing of application requests: establish categories of applications or requests; establish an order by category or otherwise for processing; set the number of applications or requests by category or otherwise to be processed in any year; and provide for the disposition of applications or requests, including those made subsequent to the first application or request. </ParaText><ParaText id="1001724">In addition, immigration and refugee officers shall comply with ministerial instructions before processing or when processing applications or requests. Applications not processed may be returned, retained or disposed of in accordance with the instructions by the minister. This does not constitute a decision not to issue a visa or other document, or grant the status or exemption in relation to which the application or request is made. Instructions shall be published in the <I>Canada Gazette</I>. Nothing in this section limits in any way the power of the minister to otherwise determine the most efficient manner in which to administer this act.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001725">These amendments essentially give the <Affiliation DbId="105834" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship and Immigration</Affiliation> carte blanche to decide which applications to process, which to hold, and which to return without even processing. Particular immigration categories will be adversely affected, such as the family class and permanent resident status made on humanitarian and compassionate grounds, H and C grounds. </ParaText><ParaText id="1001726">The amendments will reduce the incentive for the government to do what it should do: dedicate the necessary resources to increase departmental and human resource capacity to process the number of applications received each year.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001727"> However, the bright individual on the government side decided to go a little further. The bright individual decided that the government would take this piece of legislation out of its regular place and refer it to the finance committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001728">The place that this bill should be debated is specifically the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration, where both the <Affiliation DbId="105834" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship and Immigration</Affiliation> and the minister responsible for CBSA can be invited. Also, community groups, stakeholders, lawyers, immigration practitioners and others would have an opportunity to testify and give evidence on whether they would be in favour and/or against this ill thought out piece of legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001729">However, that will not be the case this time. The Conservatives have decided to circumvent all of this, put the bill in front of the House, declare it a motion of confidence, and get it passed in order for the minister to look after the backlog of immigration cases, so she says.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001730">I have news for the minister. Whether she will open her ears and listen, however, is another story. This piece of legislation will be challenged in court and struck down. This piece of legislation is not charter compliant, although she claims it is.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001731">I would like at this time to refer to a few famous Conservative quotes on citizenship and immigration. Maybe my colleagues across the way will open their ears and listen.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001732">The first quote is as follows:</ParaText><ParaText id="1001733"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">You have to remember that west of Winnipeg the ridings the Liberals hold are dominated by people who are either recent Asian immigrants or recent migrants from eastern Canada; people who live in ghettos and who are not integrated into Western Canadian society.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1001734">Who said that? The present <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001735">The second quote is as follows:</ParaText><ParaText id="1001736"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Well, I've always believed that we have to be a lot tougher with undocumented refugee claimants. Whether the best thing is to send them right out of the country or simply detain them until we get more information, we can look at either, this is a problem that does need to be fixed. Particularly post 9/11, we can't take these kinds of security risks.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1001737">Who said that? The current <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1001738">If members were to take a look at www.oneconservativevoice.ca., they would see another quote, “Another potential threat to domestic security is Canada's refugee determination”. </ParaText><ParaText id="1001739">When the Prime Minister was the chief policy officer of the Reform Party, his party platform stated that “immigration should be essentially economic in nature” and should not “be explicitly designed to radically or suddenly alter the ethnic makeup of Canada”. This was stated in the Platform and Statement of Principles of the Reform Party of Canada dated August 14, 1988. </ParaText><ParaText id="1001740">I have another quote: “Multiculturalism policy has been an abject failure...immigration continues to change the country's face more extensively than at any time since the turn of the century”. Who said that? The member for <Affiliation DbId="78914" Type="2">Kootenay—Columbia</Affiliation> as reported in the <I>Calgary Herald</I>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001741">The Canadian people simply do not trust the Conservatives to deliver on immigration and, frankly, neither do I, so I will be voting against this misguided legislation.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Komarnicki" id="2397866"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78959" Type="18">Mr. Ed Komarnicki (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1001742">Mr. Speaker, I think the member loses himself in statistics. I wonder how he explains that last year we had the highest number of newcomers in our history, 429,649. We actually did have that number. </ParaText><ParaText id="1001743">I can say that with the two ministers we have had we have passed legislation that will get thousands of lost Canadians back into the fold. With the new minister, we are amending the act to ensure we can bring more people in quicker and faster. I would encourage him to support that legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001744">One of his own people, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78467" Type="2">Etobicoke Centre</Affiliation>, said:</ParaText><ParaText id="1001745"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">I'm almost reaching the point where I believe that our whole immigration system has become dysfunctional.

He knows very well that the number he has quoted about people coming into Canada is fudged.

Some have called them the biggest changes in Canadian immigration law ever, if not in the last 40 years.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001757">It seems to me that in previous administrations the rule and policy was “Who you know in the PMO”. This had great effect as to which groups and which particular cases were given attention.

I think there is some interest for Canadians that the bill is being promoted by the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> and will go to the finance committee where suddenly immigration has become a purely financial and economic matter and nothing else. It is ironic in a country that prides itself on being a refuge and a place built on the energy and enthusiasm of the immigrants who have come here.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001759"> I think the reason we have so much passion in this place for this issue is that so many of us are, like myself, the sons or daughters of immigrants or immigrants ourselves.

The real issue is, indeed, the backlog and we need to deal with that. </ParaText><ParaText id="1001767">It is very simple. We should allocate resources where they are needed. We should expedite cases where we should. For example, a spousal case out of Colombo is taking two years, where in other places it takes six months. Although the issue is the backlog, it is also a matter of taking resources from different posts and putting them to posts where we need them to deal with the processing of applications.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001768">Maybe the minister will do something about reallocating the resources instead of having SWAT teams. She has SWAT teams of retired immigration officers who are going from country to country to deal with the backlog. These people are not getting paid normal wages. These people get paid exorbitant wages and are put in fancy hotels, which costs the department an arm and a leg.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mrs. Lavallée" id="2397885"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78473" Type="2">Mrs. Carole Lavallée (Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1001769">Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank my committee chair for his encouragement, especially since we are from different parties.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001770">I am very pleased to rise today to speak about implementing the budget. By implementing the budget, we will skirt several major issues for all Quebeckers. The Bloc Québécois has been expressing specific demands since January. Those demands have been very clear, and we will see that not one of them has been met in this budget.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001771">The budget implementation bill aims to put in place various measures that were announced when the federal budget was presented on February 26. This bill has 10 different sections that amend various Canadian laws. Part 1 amends the Income Tax Act in order to create tax-free savings accounts, increase the number of years an individual can contribute to a registered education savings plan, increase tax deductions for northern residents, increase the tax credit for medical expenses, modify the eligibility requirements for the registered disability savings plan (RDSP), extend the mineral exploration tax credit by one year, modify the rules surrounding tax credits for charitable donations, readjust the tax threshold for corporate dividends and put in place various legislative provisions to prevent implementation of the Liberal Bill <Document DbId="3072975" Type="4">C-253</Document>, which would allow RDSP contributions to be tax-free.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001772"> Parts 2 and 3 of the bill amend the excise tax legislation to adjust the tax on various tobacco products and make certain medical services GST-exempt. Part 4 dissolves the Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation. Part 5 amends the Canada Student Financial Assistance Act and the Canada Student Loans Act to modify the system and increase the number of students who are eligible for assistance. Part 6 amends the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act to authorize the minister to give priority to certain applications and refuse others without having to provide justification to the applicants.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001773">Part 7 creates the Canada Employment Insurance Financing Board. The board's mandate is to set the premium rate and manage a financial reserve. In other words, employment insurance will be managed independently and any surpluses will no longer be paid into the government's consolidated revenue account. Parts 8 and 9 authorize payments to be made out of the 2007-08 surplus to various organizations and programs. This part of the budget implementation bill includes the payments for carbon capture in Saskatchewan and the $400 million fund to recruit new police officers. Part 10 amends various acts.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001774">I want to reiterate the Bloc's position. This may seem like a good budget, but it has next to nothing for Quebec and Quebeckers. Clearly, the Conservative members from Quebec have done nothing to defend Quebec's interests. Obviously, a member of a party that defends Alberta, cannot defend Quebec's interests at the same time. Members will see this as I go along, and I will come back to this point at the end.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001775"> Budget 2008 may seem like a good budget, but it does not comply with the demands the Bloc Québécois made public on January 23, 2008. First, it does not provide any direct, immediate assistance for the manufacturing and forestry industries, which are in crisis. Tens of thousands of jobs have now been lost in Quebec, and this government has done nothing and does not intend to do anything in this budget.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001776">The budget does nothing to help the workers and communities hit by the crisis. It contains no measures to reimburse seniors who have been shortchanged by the guaranteed income supplement program. It continues to take a polluter-paid approach to the Alberta oil companies, rather than a polluter-pay approach, and it refuses to make a 180-degree turn on the environment. The budget makes no major investment in culture and does not undo the ideological cuts made by the Conservative government. It reiterates the government's intention of creating a single securities commission.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001777">For all these reasons, the Bloc Québécois is against this bill and will vote against it.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="30">(1030)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1001778">Let us talk about the problem with immigration. The minister is giving herself discretionary power. Bill <Document DbId="3354384" Type="3">C-50</Document> offers far too much discretionary power to the <Affiliation DbId="105834" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship and Immigration</Affiliation> in determining who can and cannot enter Canada. The minister is arguing that we have to be able to clear the backlog as quickly as possible in order to give priority to those who could alleviate the labour shortage in Canada and Quebec. She will be able to determine which persons will have priority to enter Canada based on the individual's training or occupation. The Conservatives are saying that training and occupation can negatively affect a person's chance at entering Canada. If persons applying to enter Canada have the misfortune of not having the training or occupations in demand in Canada, they may have to wait much longer than other immigrants to obtain a visa to enter the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001779">Although the Bloc Québécois supports the idea of reducing the backlog, it is opposed to replacing the existing transparent and objective immigration system. The government might say that we have to be fair. The goal of any good legislation is to prevent things from getting out of control. Bill <Document DbId="3354384" Type="3">C-50</Document> gives far too much power to the <Affiliation DbId="105834" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship and Immigration</Affiliation>. This can open the door to abuse because there is nothing to counterbalance the minister's discretionary powers.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001780">The Bloc Québécois prefers an immigration system based on a system that is fair, transparent and equitable for everyone. By comparison, in order to accelerate the contract awarding process, would it be acceptable for a minister to have discretionary power to offer contracts and circumvent the call for tenders system for the simple reason that waiting times need to be shortened? The answer is self-evident.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001781">The Bloc Québécois is also deeply concerned about the fact that the federal government would no longer be required to review applications for permanent residency, on humanitarian grounds, from foreign nationals applying from outside Canada. In the absence of a real refugee appeal division, the option of entering Canada on humanitarian grounds is often the only alternative available to refugees. This is proof that the Conservatives are insensitive to the suffering endured by some people in the world. We have a humanitarian obligation to at least consider their requests.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001782">Rather than completely overhauling the system and getting rid of a transparent system, there are other ways for the government to speed up case processing. It could increase staffing in foreign countries, and it could speed up the appointment of commissioners to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada. Since coming to power, the Conservatives have slowed the commissioner appointment process down considerably. Delays in case processing in Canada are due primarily to staff shortages, to a shortage of commissioners. The Conservatives are partly to blame for this problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001783">With Bill <Document DbId="3354384" Type="3">C-50</Document>, the Conservatives are trying to fix a problem that they themselves created. Since the Conservatives have formed the government, the selection committee has recommended some 60 qualified individuals to fill the vacant commissioner positions. When the Conservatives came to power, there were five vacancies at the IRB. Currently, there are just under 50 vacant commissioner positions out of 156.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001784">There are two reasons for that gap. First, the Conservative government has been making fewer new appointments. Since coming to power in February 2006, the Conservatives have appointed just 27 commissioners. Moreover, they have renewed very few of the commissioners whose terms have expired. Since February 2006, only seven commissioners' appointments have been renewed.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001785">I should explain that a commissioner's term lasts three years. What usually happens is that one-third of the commissioners are appointed every year to compensate for terms that expire that year. The problem is not a shortage of candidates. When the former chairperson of the commission, Jean-Guy Fleury, appeared before the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration, he said that the minister had a list of 80 candidates when Mr. Fleury left his job on March 16, 2007. The government is taking its own sweet time appointing commissioners.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001786">Because there are so many vacancies at the IRB, case processing is slowing down again. The waiting list is starting to get longer. At the end of 2006, there were 23,495 applications pending, an increase of 3,000 applications over the previous year at that time. In the past year, the average application processing time has increased from 11.7 months to 14.3 months. These delays have resulted in three major problems. The Government of Quebec has to pay for social services until refugee claimants get an answer.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1001787">Thus, the longer it takes to complete the process, the more it costs the Quebec government.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001788">In the case of family reunification, it is the families that must pay while awaiting the decision. The family must meet the needs of its family members who are applying to stay in Canada. Thus, the longer it takes to complete the process, the more it costs the families.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001789">Some refugee claimants are denied status based on a criminal record or shady past. Thus, the longer it takes to complete the process, the greater the risk of security problems.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001790">Experts are accusing Stephen Harper's government of delaying the appointments because the candidates proposed so far do not share the Conservative Party ideology.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001791"><B>An hon. member:</B> She named the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001792"><B>Mrs. Carole Lavallée:</B> I apologize, Mr. Speaker. I meant to say the Conservative government. I am sorry.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001793">In the agriculture file, the Bloc Québécois called for the implementation of an action plan to address the crisis in the livestock industry—pork and beef, in particular—as well as improvements to the income support programs. In this Conservative budget, farmers will have to make do with an additional $72 million over two years for agricultural programs, while forestry workers will not see any new money at all. </ParaText><ParaText id="1001794">The government says it intends to change how emergency advances are given through the advance payments program, by allocating $22.1 million to that adjustment in 2008-09. That measure was introduced in Bill <Document DbId="3293100" Type="3">C-44</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001795">The government says it will create a cull breeding swine program. The federal government will invest $50 million in 2007-08 in this program, which will be administered by the Canadian Pork Council. Ottawa thereby hopes to reduce the Canadian breeding swine inventory by 10%. The government hopes this will facilitate the transition for any producers who wish to get out of the pork industry. Payments would be based on the number of animals and on reimbursement costs for humane slaughter and carcass disposal.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001796">As we can see, the Harper government has ignored the appeals—</ParaText><ParaText id="1001797"><B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh!</ParaText><ParaText id="1001798"><B>Mrs. Carole Lavallée:</B> The Conservative government, I mean, has ignored the appeals for assistance from farmers and forestry workers who have been the victims of an unprecedented income crisis.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001799">Another one of the Bloc's demands that comes up often has to do with employment insurance. The Bloc Québécois was calling for the creation of an independent employment insurance fund and for significant improvements to the plan. In particular, we were calling on the government to implement a minimum eligibility threshold of 360 hours for all regions and all claimants. Under this minimum eligibility threshold, however, claimants would be eligible for a varying number of weeks of benefits, based on the unemployment rate in their region. We also called on the government to lengthen the benefit period by five weeks for all regions, regardless of the number of hours required to qualify. The maximum number of weeks of benefits would go from 45 to 50 weeks. Furthermore, we wanted the rate of benefits to be increased from 55% to 60%.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001800">What do we have in the Conservative budget? The budget provides for a new crown corporation, the Canada Employment Insurance Financing Board, which will report to the <Affiliation DbId="105827" Type="4">Minister of Human Resources and Social Development</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001801">This board will be responsible for managing a separate bank account. Each year, any employment insurance fund surplus will be saved and invested until it is needed to cover the program costs.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001802">Moreover, as of 2009, a new rate-setting mechanism will be put in place. It will take into account any surpluses or deficits so that income and expenses balance out over the years. The rates set by the board cannot fluctuate more than 15% in a given year, in order to ensure a stable rate.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001803">In addition, the government plans on maintaining a balance of $2 billion in the bank account of the Canada Employment Insurance Financing Board.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001804">As we can see, the Conservatives have finally bowed to one Bloc demand and will stop pillaging the employment insurance fund. The Bloc Québécois believes that instead of creating a new crown corporation, the mandate of the employment insurance commission could have been amended. The Bloc Québécois believes that creating an independent fund should improve the plan and not just reduce contributions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001805">In addition, the Conservative government is ignoring the $54 billion debt to those who contributed to the plan and to all Quebeckers. It is paradoxical that the Conservatives say they hope to “ensure that EI premiums are dedicated exclusively to the EI program” but that in a few weeks time they will take the 2007-08 surplus and pay down the debt.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1001806">They seem to be going against their own philosophy. The Bloc Québécois asked that a $1.5 billion fund be established to ensure that this year's surplus be used strictly for the employment insurance fund. The Conservative budget fails to enhance in any way the employment insurance fund and, once again, there is a lack of consideration by this government for the unemployed. Nevertheless, we must consider the creation of this fund to be an immense victory for the Bloc Québécois.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001807">With regard to aboriginal peoples, the Bloc Québécois had demanded that the federal government respect the agreements between the former government and aboriginal peoples and make provision for the required funding. The Bloc Québécois also expects the federal government to meet the urgent need for housing on reserves.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001808">The 2008 budget sets aside an additional $660 million over two years for economic development and the improvement of academic performance, health, and the well-being of children and families, as well as the improvement of water quality and management. Unfortunately, although the $660 million investment may seem to be a large amount at first glance, the funds come primarily from monies set aside in the 2006 budget.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001809">The budget does not meet the needs of aboriginal Canadians, since the money should have been announced in 2006. This funding comes too late and is just a drop in the bucket when compared to the defunct Kelowna accord. Expectations were high when the Kelowna accord was signed, and now there is major disappointment. No significant money was provided for social housing on reserves. Despite the need for more than 10,000 homes in Quebec alone, there is not enough allocated to improving the socio-economic conditions in first nations communities. Although there was a surplus in the last fiscal year, no money was set aside to fight poverty among aboriginals.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001810">I would now like to talk about the Bloc's demand concerning the status of women. The Bloc Québécois wanted a series of measures to foster equality between men and women, in particular, the reinstatement of the court challenges program, the reinstatement of funding for Status of Women Canada and the improvement of the employment insurance plan, which is currently not advantageous for women. The Conservative budget does nothing for women. In fact, the word appears only six times in the budget, including the note in the French text regarding the use of the masculine gender to cover both men and women. </ParaText><ParaText id="1001811">The budget includes the following paragraph entitled, “Advancing Equality of Women”. It reads, “Budget 2007 increased the women's program budget to $20 million. Over the next year, the government will build on this achievement through the development of an action plan that will advance the equality of women across Canada through the improvement of their economic and social conditions and their participation in democratic life.”</ParaText><ParaText id="1001812">Members will recall that women's rights groups saw their funding disappear, since they were excluded from the new women's program, and will also recall that the women's program was funded through cuts to Status of Women.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001813">The Conservative budget ignores women's concerns such as pay equity and the fight for equality. The Bloc Québécois is eagerly awaiting the Conservative action plan, but is expecting the same reactionary and backward-looking vision we are used to on this issue. And I will not even begin to speak about Bill <Document DbId="3097460" Type="4">C-484</Document>, introduced by a Conservative member, which is an embarrassment to all women. </ParaText><ParaText id="1001814">The Bloc Québécois had even more expectations in terms of international cooperation, including achieving the goal of 0.7% of the GDP by 2015, as set out by the UN. We could reach that by increasing ODA budgets by 12% per year over the next three years and then by 15% per year until 2015.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001815">In the 2008 budget, the government is committing to double international aid based on 2001-02 numbers, to bring it up to $5 billion by 2010-11. The budget also includes an additional $100 million for the reconstruction and development of Afghanistan, which would bring the projected value of Canada's aid program in Afghanistan up to $280 million in 2008-09. As well, aid to Africa would be doubled by 2008-09. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="45">(1045)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1001816">There is $450 million, for the next three years, for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. As well there is $50 million over two years for an innovation fund. However, the federal budget still does not present a credible plan for achieving the goal of 0.7% of the GDP by 2015 so that Canada can reach the UN's millennium goals.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001817">All of the Bloc's demands were ignored. There is nothing for workers. There is no POWA, no regional development, no reinvestment in culture and nothing for social housing. It is equally bleak for women. For these reasons, the Bloc Québécois will vote against this bill. </ParaText></Content></Intervention><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Komarnicki" id="2397911"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78959" Type="18">Mr. Ed Komarnicki (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1001818">Mr. Speaker, I want to state to the member that of course the minister's instructions would be only those that would support the attainment of the immigration goals established by the Government of Canada.

It is a bad solution to a real problem. This real problem is the backlog of applications. The secretary said that 850 applications were delayed. According to the information I have, 24,000 applications have not yet been processed. </ParaText><ParaText id="1001824">The problem is not that the minister does not make decisions quickly because she lacks sufficient power to make them. The problem is that there is a shortage of commissioners at the Immigration and Refugee Board.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001825">This government has not appointed the necessary commissioners. As I said earlier, there are 156 vacant positions. More correctly, there are currently a little less than 50 vacant commissioner positions out of 156.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001826">Two reasons account for this gap. First, the government has slowed the pace of appointments. Since coming to power, it has appointed only 27 commissioners. Furthermore, it has renewed almost none of the terms of commissioners whose terms have expired. Since February 2006, the mandates of only seven commissioners have been renewed. That is the real problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="1001827">The government should perhaps begin by appointing all the commissioners that should be appointed.

We are also faced with a skills shortage, of which people on both sides of the House, I am sure, are quite aware. We also live in a world that is extremely competitive when it comes to globalization and competing for economic well-being and raising the standard of living and quality of life of the people we represent. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002153">Given that context, we have to wonder why the Conservative government, during an era when Canada needs people from all over the world, would reduce the number of landed immigrants allowed to come to Canada. In the first two years the Conservatives have reduced the number by 36,000. From an economic, social and cultural perspective, that type of measure simply does not make any sense.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002154">When I heard the government would introduce a section on immigration through Bill <Document DbId="3354384" Type="3">C-50</Document>, which is a budget implementation bill, I thought perhaps it would come up with something that would speak to great financial commitments to immigration. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002155">I was really surprised to find out that the budget bill only has a 1% increase in overall departmental funding. What is really odd about this is the fact that we are faced with a backlog of 900,000 cases, yet there is such a meagre increase in departmental investment when it comes to immigration. That is of concern to me as an individual who appreciates the great contribution newcomers have made to Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002156">It is quite puzzling to see the government trying to sneak this through a budget implementation bill. It is also puzzling that it will be reducing the number of landed immigrants in Canada by 36,000 and is not seeing immigration as an important pillar to Canada's future success.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002157">There is a history here. We can go back to Diefenbaker, who attempted something very similar to what the present <Affiliation DbId="105834" Type="4">Minister of Immigration</Affiliation> has attempted to do to deal with the present backlog. This attempt by Diefenbaker's government was pushed back by communities and members of the House of Commons, who felt that it simply was not fair. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002158">The government's response to the global challenges we face and all the issues we have to deal with is found basically in three things that I will highlight, and I draw this from the budget bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002159">The first change to consider is that of clause 11. Currently, the act requires that an immigration officer shall issue a visa to any person who meets the requirements set out in the act. If passed, these amendments would grant the minister the power to arbitrarily decide that a person no longer meets the requirements they once did. That person's application may no longer be processed and a visa may no longer be granted. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002160">Individuals who fulfill all the requirements and who have been waiting patiently for years to have their applications reviewed may all of a sudden be advised that their applications category is now being denied. That can be done in a very arbitrary way, just because. That is unfair. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1002161">It is simply not justice that, at any point in time, one individual's whose application category may have in fact been accepted is now not accepted any longer because the minister decides that is what she wants to do today. Tomorrow she can change her mind and change categories and requirements and do as she pleases without really debating the issue. Everything becomes effective immediately when she wants it to become effective. That is unfair. It is not following due process.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002162">The claim is that all this is to deal with a backlog. When we do a bit of research, what happens? We discover that does not make sense either. When we go to the departmental website, we find this quote:</ParaText><ParaText id="1002163"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left">Once passed, the new measures will apply to applications received on or after February 27, 2008.</QuotePara><QuotePara Align="Left"> Those who applied prior to February 27, 2008, will not be subject to the new measures and will be dealt with fairly under the existing rules. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1002164">If these rules are not applied to the backlog, then how will they help the backlog? Exactly what does “will be dealt with fairly under the existing rules” mean? Am I being told that the new rules are unfair? Is that what the minister is telling Canadians? Is she saying that anybody prior to February 27, 2008 will be dealt with fairly, but after that they will not be dealt with fairly?</ParaText><ParaText id="1002165">These are quotes that concern me a great deal. I am sure these quotes concern the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78831" Type="2">Beaches—East York</Affiliation>, with whom I am sharing my time, and she will also elaborate on all of these points. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002166">This is unfair legislation. It speaks to a total disregard by the Conservative government to the immigration community, to immigrants who have helped build our country. It is time the Conservatives come clean with their agenda. They need to explain to Canadians why, in their first two years in government, they have reduced landed immigrant landings by 36,000. There have been 36,000 fewer immigrants allowed into Canada. Why is this happening? Why is the Conservative government shutting its doors on immigrants?</ParaText><ParaText id="1002167">The Conservatives can fudge the numbers. The government can talk about over 400,000 people who have been allowed into Canada. They are not talking about landed immigrants. They are talking about student visas and other permits that are given. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002168">Then we look at clause 87. There is a new concept called “Instructions” that does not exist in current legislation. This allows the minister to cap immigration applications, set categories of applications to be considered, deny the processing of certain application categories. The danger is that these instructions can be issued at any time and take effect immediately. They will not be required to be pre-published or debated. This process, if passed, would lack fundamental transparency and ensure accountability.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002169">In this day and age, when Canada requires the help of immigrants from across the globe, the people who have helped build this country, we cannot stand still in the House of Commons and accept from the Conservative government an agenda that shuts the door on immigrants in a very arbitrary way simply because the government feels like it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002170">The government also tries to fool Canadians by saying that it is serious about reducing the backlog of 900,000 applicants. What did the government do? It increased the departmental budget by a mere 1%. The parliamentary secretary knows the job will not be done with $22 million.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002171">When the minister says she is going to eliminate the backlog, she knows she is misleading Canadians.

She has that kind of power. There is all the power that the minister could possibly have, except that it is transparent.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002197">Maybe we need to have a little definition about what we mean by immigrant. I was one. I came here in 1957 as a child. I was very much involved with immigrant communities in the city of Toronto as a volunteer. Let us see, these are people who apply to come to Canada as permanent residents. Once they are approved, they arrive here. They have a residency card. After three years they are eligible to apply for citizenship. Then they become full participants in our social, economic, cultural and political life, and the infrastructure of Canada. They become an inherent part of our nation and participate in the future building of our country.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002198">That is pretty clear, I would think. Nonetheless, the government insists on saying, or as the minister just corrected a few minutes ago, that we have allowed in the country 429,649 new Canadians. In my view, in all of my 30 years of volunteerism in the community, new immigrants means new Canadians. They are still immigrants who come to settle here.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002199">However, that figure is not really true because in 2007, only 236,689 were actually given landed status visas, and the previous year it was 262,000, so actually 36,000 less came. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002200">The number is being inflated we know now by foreign students, foreign workers and all kinds of visitors visas, et cetera. Some of these people are coming here to assist with work and some are coming here to study. They are not immigrants, people who are fighting to come to this country. The government is purposely misleading Canadians, purposely fudging the numbers, intentionally to confuse and complicate the whole thing.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002201">I am quite insulted by all of that. Having worked with immigrant communities for decades in the city of Toronto, I find this totally offensive and so will many people.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002202">Let me tell the hon. members opposite how reform of immigration is actually done. When the former minister of immigration, the hon. Lucienne Robillard, decided that we needed to upgrade the Canada Immigration Act and the Refugee Act, she actually commissioned a study. Then the minister, the bureaucrats and other members of the House travelled across this country of ours and consulted with Canadians to determine what kind of Canada they wanted to see, the kinds of rules they thought were needed, and the kinds of changes that should be made to the Immigration Act.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002203">Open and transparent legislation was placed in the House of Commons. It was debated at committee. The rules and regulations were gazetted for a period of, I believe, 90 days, so that again we could have feedback from Canadians as to whether those rules would have unintended consequences or cause problems. It was a transparent and open process administered by a minister who was open and worked with Canadians. That is how we change the situation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002204">The present government, unfortunately, is doing something altogether different. First, it has not tabled a proper bill in the House. It has tacked it after the fact to the budget bill, which is totally insulting to not only the House but Canadians of different backgrounds and all citizens in this country.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002205">The government is trying to excuse itself by saying that we have 900,000 people backlogged in the system and that is why we have to do this.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002206">First of all, the powers for the minister to decide at the last minute to change categories, changing which category comes in, more or less, whether it is the family class or not, the minister may decide to reduce these numbers and nobody would know.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1002207">To do all of these changes, none of those things will affect the backlog. She can cherry-pick a few people or change the categories, but it will not change the backlog. What would change that is if the government had followed through on $700 million of monies that had been allocated to address the problem of human resources at the immigration department.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002208">I have said for many years that one of the problems of the immigration department was that it did not have enough human resources to deal with the applicants and deal with the work that it had.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002209">But no, the government chose to cut that back and now it is trying to say it is dealing with a backlog to which it has been a partner in increasing for the last while and that is supposed to resolve the problem. The minister in private quarters, somewhere invisible, unobserved and unchecked by anyone, is going to change things and decide when, where and who gets to come to this country.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002210">There is right now, for instance, a point system. If the minister really and truly decides that we need to have more skilled labour, that is fewer university graduates and more skilled labour because that is where the shortage is, she is free to change the point system. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002211">She is free to publish that in the <I>Canada Gazette</I> openly and for people to comment. The minister has all the powers under the current legislation to act and adjust if she needs to. She does not have to totally eliminate that part and have the government give her the kinds of powers where she can do as she pleases behind closed doors.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002212">I remember a time, which was before my time, but I do remember history, when southern Europeans were not allowed into this country. There were very few Italian Canadians or southern Europeans who came and only worked on the railway in the northern part of the country. They were not necessarily allowed to bring their spouses. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002213">We know what happened to the members of the Chinese community with the Chinese head tax.

I find them offensive. I think they are extremely destructive and anti-democratic. I believe that the government needs to review its reasons for doing what it wants to do. The numbers are clear. I think it is time that the government stop purposely misinforming the public and the House with its numbers.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002216">When the minister proudly stands up and says 429,000 new Canadians, they are not new Canadians. They are not here to stay. A student is here to study and will most likely leave unless in a year he or she applies. Some individuals with work permits come here on a temporary basis unless they apply. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002217">Immigrants are people who have decided to make their life in this country on a permanent basis, to commit for the rest of their life to this country.

Yet the government is indifferent to the plight of working families in my riding and other ridings across this country.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002242">I want to talk about housing for a moment. The budget failed dismally on the housing front. In a recent meeting of provincial housing ministers, the government once again failed to talk about a national housing strategy. In fact, the minister who attended for a brief period of time would not commit to extend some of those very important funding programs, and I will address that in one moment. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002243">I want to mention a couple of numbers relative to my riding, from CMHC's statistics. This is a credible organization. It talks about trends. In Nanaimo apartment rents are rising and the vacancy rate is dropping. Many people on fixed and low incomes rely on rental accommodation for their living space. As rents rise, as vacancy rates drop and as no new units are being built, people are being squeezed out of their homes. For people who have lived in the same place all of their lives, it is unfair to tell them that they have to move now because they simply cannot afford or cannot find accommodation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002244">In the south end of the riding, in Cowichan, there was a study done on inadequate shelter in the Cowichan Valley from the fall of 2006. It reported:</ParaText><ParaText id="1002245"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">No new rental units have been built in the Cowichan region during the last twenty years, therefore,the supply is scarce. Vacancy rates in private rental buildings in the City of Duncan and in North Cowichan have declined in recent years from 8.4% in October 2002 to 1.6% in October 2005. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1002246"> In 2001 more than 6% of households in the CVRD, the Cowichan Valley Regional District, had incomes of less than $10,000 and an additional 14% had incomes of between $10,000 and $19,000. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1002247">Those kinds of numbers show that a significant proportion of households in my riding are paying far more than 30% of their income for housing. Housing is one of the social determinants of health. When people cannot access affordable accommodation, it impacts on every other aspect of their lives. In a country as rich as ours, we should not be asking people to pay more than 30% of their income for their housing. They should have access to safe, affordable, clean housing.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002248">The Federation of Canadian Municipalities has been highly critical of the government. It talked about the fact that there needs to be a national housing strategy. In its plan, Recommendations for a National Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness, it says:</ParaText><ParaText id="1002249"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Housing is a basic and fundamental issue affecting individuals and communities and an important determinant of health and well-being.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1002250">The federation went on to talk about the fact that it is not only a social issue, that it is an economic issue. If workers are not well housed, it is very difficult for them to go to work each and every day and be productive. In fact, people who are forced out on the street often lose their employment because they have no place to shower, no place to get adequate sleep, no place to store their work clothes.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002251">Housing is a fundamental human right. We should not be having this conversation in this day and age in Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002252">The Federation of Canadian Municipalities has laid out a very concrete action plan. It has a five year target and specific things around ending chronic homelessness, expanding the stock of affordable non-market housing, reducing the backlog in core housing needs, preserving and modifying Canada's existing social housing stock, and extending and revising the residential rehabilitation assistance program to improve conditions in existing private stock and to rehabilitate 10,000 homes annually. That is some of the funding we are going to see disappear over the next couple of years. That funding has been absolutely critical for the economic and social health and well-being of our communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002253">I want to briefly talk about transit. In my riding we have what we think is a jewel in a rail corridor with some functioning rolling stock. Although there was money announced in the budget around transit, there was no money targeted for Vancouver Island. Vancouver Island is growing by leaps and bounds. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002254">The organization Our Corridor talks about the importance of investing in rail in our community. It can lead to sustainable economic development, reduce greenhouse gases, and support the efforts in terms of greening our transit systems. What it needs is some very specific federal attention.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002255">This is an opportunity for the federal, provincial and municipal governments to come together in a very strong partnership to invest in rail on Vancouver Island. This initiative has been driven by municipalities and a number of businesses and first nations on Vancouver Island. I would urge the government to look at this very important investment.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002256">In the time remaining I want to speak about first nations education. Consistently the Conservative government has talked about education as being a way out of poverty, yet the Conservative government has consistently underfunded education for aboriginal people. To put this in context, article 13 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples states: </ParaText><ParaText id="1002257"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Indigenous peoples have the right to revitalize, use, develop and transmit to future generations their histories, languages, oral traditions, philosophies, writing systems and literatures, and to designate and retain their own names for communities, places and persons. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1002258"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">States shall take effective measures to ensure that this right is protected--</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1002259">Article 14 states:</ParaText><ParaText id="1002260"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Indigenous peoples have the right to establish and control their educational systems and institutions providing education in their own languages--</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1002261">These set a context that although Canada did not support the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, countries all over the world have supported this declaration. Canada must agree that education is not only an economic driver and an important way of culture, but it is also a fundamental right in terms of ensuring that first nations and Inuit people across this country have access to education.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Tonks" id="2398414"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78347" Type="2">Mr. Alan Tonks (York South—Weston, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1002262">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments made by my colleague across the floor with respect to housing and affordability. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002263">One of the issues in my riding, which is equally very needy, is an issue that I come up against day after day.

A research study, which was actually funded in large part by the Government of Canada, was done on homelessness in Toronto. As the member has raised this issue, I tried to reflect on some of the numbers, which I think would exemplify why it is important for us to get the facts and to know them, rather than present issues as very simplistic and having simple solutions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002282">In the Toronto situation, and I think it was from the Anne Golden report, 35% of the homeless were people who suffered from mental illness. If we provide some sort of accommodation, whether it be a rent supplement or rent geared to income, they will not take it. A lot of this happened because we are not providing the mental health facilities for a very serious problem in Canada, and that is mental illness.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002283">Twenty-eight per cent of the homeless in Toronto were youth on the street who had been alienated from their families. It was found that 75% of those youth who were on the streets of Toronto had suffered from physical or mental abuse in their homes. This does not have a lot to do with economics. It has to do with a serious social problem, and that is family issues and dealing with our youth. In fact, when 75% of these youth on the streets are suffering from physical or mental abuse, the problem is much more than providing a little box somewhere for them to live. We need to deal with the problem at the beginning.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002284">Of the homeless in Toronto, and I am sure in Winnipeg, Manitoba it would be about the same, 12% were aboriginals off reserve. It is kind of interesting. A very significant number of aboriginals who are living off reserve are a significant number of the homeless in our country. This is a shame. I must admit that when the Kelowna accord was brought forward I thought there was hope for aboriginals, with the leadership as a starting role, to bring the dignity and assistance that was needed in our aboriginal communities, but the Conservative government decided that Kelowna just was not of interest to it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002285">Ten per cent of the homeless represent abused women on the street. We can only imagine that there are a lot of circumstances where women, who have been the provider for their families in terms of caring for the family homes and the children, do not have the economic independence maybe that their spouse has after a divorce or after a break-up because of abuse.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002286">Therefore, what happens to women? Some in the shelters do their job but there is the mental duress of having a breakdown and of being an abused person. I know, having spent five years on the board of my own shelter for battered women, that there is a great deal of mental stress and duress with regard to that. We have people on the streets and just saying that we will give them a spot to live in a subsidized social housing unit or something like that will not solve the problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002287">Finally, about 10% of the homeless were actually on the street for economic reasons.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002288">Putting it all in context, it would appear that the solution to homelessness in Canada, particularly as it relates to urban centres, is not to provide subsidized homes to people. We need to deal with the root causes. When we approach problems, we need to demonstrate first that we understand the problem and then, second, apply solutions that deal effectively with the root causes of the problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002289">If we take that as an approach to legislation and to budget making, if we look carefully at this budget, we will find that it has not identified a problem. It has not defined a problem. It has not identified a priority or an objective.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1002290">This budget has presented Canadians with a litany of gimmicks. It is trying to look attractive to a bunch of different disparate groups. It is called trying to appeal to voters that one wants to get for the next election.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002291">Governing is not just about spending taxpayers' money to get votes, or buying their vote with their money which is what it really is all about. Why I can say that is because when the Liberals took over government in 1993 it inherited from the Conservative government a $42 billion deficit in that fiscal year. That was $42 billion more spent than what was brought in.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002292">We could not just cut some expenses somewhere and get rid of $42 billion of overspending. It took some time. It took three years. It was not until 1997 that the Government of Canada finally boasted of a balanced budget. It was a lot of pain for everyone in the country. Cuts were made to things as fundamental as health care, social services and the operations of the Government of Canada itself took the biggest hit of all.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002293">The good news was that after about three years the fiscal position of Canada was at least back in a balanced position. Then, with strategic initiatives, with investment in infrastructure, which we started in 1993 with the investment in science and technology and research and development, we invested in our future, and very slowly surpluses started to be developed.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002294">Members will know that we paid down over $100 billion worth of debt. When we started, 42¢ or 43¢ of every $1 that was being paid by Canadian taxpayers to the Government of Canada to manage had to go to pay down the interest on the debt that we were carrying.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002295">It was nothing like that any more. All of a sudden, as the fiscal health became stronger, more surpluses were being developed. It was not a matter of just paying down the debt. As we earned it, as Canadians earned it, as our economy started to grow, as we started to get more efficiency in the operations of the government, more and more dollars were there to put back into health care and into other issues that were the priorities of Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002296">We had 10 years of balanced budgets. When the government across the way took over in January after the election, the House of Commons started the first session of the current Parliament in April. The year end of the Government of Canada is March 31. Therefore, before the government even did a thing, we reported for that last year a $10 billion surplus, which the Conservatives like to take credit for.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002297">I do not care who takes credit for it but the fact is the Conservative government inherited a very healthy fiscal position. We had cut taxes and we invested in the economy. We invested in people and in our health care and in the services they needed. We believe that governments have a role to play in the lives of people, particularly those who are not in a position to help themselves.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002298">Therefore, it was really important to get the fiscal house in order. It led to the appropriate investments. We took the opportunity to get our fiscal house in order and Canadians have been the beneficiaries.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002299">Where are we now? The government is forecasting no more big $10 billion surpluses that can be invested or used to pay down debt. What is it talking about now? One SARS or one unforeseen circumstance will put this country back in deficit.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002300">The bottom line is that the budget that the Conservatives have presented to Canadians has no vision and has no purpose other than trying to buy votes with Canadians' own money. It is bringing us back down to the old days of being back in deficit financing. That is what Canadians have to look forward to with another year of Conservative governing.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Goldring" id="2398450"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78736" Type="2">Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1002301">Mr. Speaker, for the record, we should review and analyze. After 10 years of doing work in homeless situations and visiting shelters from coast to coast and throughout the United States, the most commonly accepted numbers of homeless people who are in the shelters and the conditions and reasons for being there are: approximately 25% because of addictions; 25% because of severe mental illness; and fully 50% because there is not affordable housing for them.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002302">The member refers to the Anne Golden report for the city of Toronto.

Singles housing is the largest need of those who are in the shelters.

It seems to me that the Liberal line for today is that corporate tax cuts are good things because eventually the benefits will trickle down and there will be more jobs created and there will be a green and pleasant land.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002308">What I am trying to understand from the Liberal Party, and maybe he can help me, is we changed the budget in 2005 to provide $4.5 billion in investments for infrastructure in cities, for housing and for key investments. We had to get the Liberals to change the budget because they wanted to give out corporate tax cuts. They seem to now believe that is the wrong direction, that corporate tax cuts are the way to go, and they support the government on that. We had the debate in the House on this.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002309">I am confused because by the same token they take offence to the Conservative government pointing the finger at the Government of Ontario for not cutting corporate taxes further.

First, I would like to state the position of the Bloc Québécois on this budget, which does not meet the conditions the Bloc set for giving its approval. You may have heard our position several times, but I want to state it for the people who are listening to us and watching us on television and who may not have heard it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002314"> It is our position that the budget does not provide any direct, immediate assistance for the manufacturing and forestry industries, which are in crisis. It does nothing to help the workers and communities hit by the crisis. It contains no measures to reimburse seniors who have been shortchanged by the guaranteed income supplement program. It continues to take a polluter-paid approach rather than a polluter-pay approach, and it refuses to make a 180-degree turn on the environment.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002315">Clearly, the budget makes no major investment in culture and does not undo the many ideological cuts made by the government in programs such as the court challenges program and the women's program. It also appears—the budget is clear on this—that the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> is going ahead with his crusade to create a single securities commission for Canada. This plan has been criticized not only by the Bloc Québécois, but by the entire National Assembly and Quebec's finance minister, Monique Jérôme-Forget, who did not shy away from reacting publicly to the budget in the national media. And I am sure that she has made her views known to the Minster of Finance and the Premier of Quebec.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002316">This bill covers a number of issues. As I have just 10 minutes, I would like to focus on areas I take a special interest in, such as natural resources. As a member of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources, I paid special attention to this part of the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002317">The budget allocates $10 million over two years to help the forestry sector break into the international market as a model of innovation. The timing is good, because the committee has just completed a study of the sector. Many witnesses told us that $10 million is a nice gesture, but that it is not enough, given the crisis, and that more money is needed. We agree with the many witnesses who took the time to meet with parliamentarians during our hearings on the forestry crisis.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002318">I am still wondering about this. We did not have a chance to talk to the <Affiliation DbId="78751" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> because his agenda was too full to appear before the committee members and explain things to us. Apparently, however, he will soon come and tell us about the $300 million in the budget for nuclear energy, most of it earmarked for the new CANDU reactor and for safety upgrades at the Chalk River lab in Ontario.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002319">Naturally, we would not oppose making a facility safer. You all know about what happened recently at the Chalk River lab. The reactor was shut down last winter for safety reasons. Unfortunately, that resulted in the president, Ms. Keen, being dismissed. The Bloc Québécois still believes that the minister engaged in political interference by removing her from her position on the eve of her appearance as president of the facility before the Standing Committee on Natural Resources for a specific study. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002320">As the natural resources critic for the Bloc Québécois, I look forward to hearing what the minister has to say and asking him questions. For now, we have no way of knowing how that $300 million is going to be distributed, how much taxpayers will be asked to pay for the development of the advanced CANDU reactor, or how much of the $300 million will be used to make the Chalk River site safer.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1002321">It is rather worrisome. They have started to think—and the <Affiliation DbId="78751" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> comes right out and says so—that nuclear energy is an energy of the future, a clean energy. But my political party and I do not believe it is a clean energy. Although with this energy there are no greenhouse gas emissions, there is still work to be done before it can be considered clean, since it generates waste, and we are still unsure of the long-term effects of this waste, or how it will be managed.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002322">It is natural that debates are being held in the provinces, since energy falls under provincial jurisdiction. The fact remains that the current Conservative government is promoting nuclear energy in Canada and all over the world. The Bloc Québécois and I do not think this is a good sign. We see that nuclear energy would perhaps cut down on greenhouse gases in the short term, but it also brings about major problems related to the management of nuclear waste, the safety of citizens who live near nuclear facilities, and the possibility that terrorists could use the waste to create weapons.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002323">Now, I will talk about the environment. In the Standing Committee on Natural Resources, we did a study on the oil sands and we came to understand the significance and size of such operations in Canada in terms of the future and the potential of these operations.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002324">Obviously the oil companies, the explorers and the beneficiaries are investing a lot, but in exchange, they make huge profits. One thing is certain, people in my riding have written to me to ask why oil companies, which make huge profits by operating in areas such as the oil sands—the royalties, after all, go to the Province of Alberta—and which have received so much assistance from the taxpayers of Quebec and Canada, are receiving more assistance in order to generate less pollution. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002325">I would point out that $240 million was allocated in the budget for carbon capture and sequestration pilot projects. I truly believe that oil companies and other producers of fossil fuels have the means to invest in green technologies. In fact, I believe that it is their responsibility to do so. It is not up to taxpayers to once again dig into their pockets. The budget already forces them to do that. The money in the budget is not government money but taxpayers' money. More taxpayer's money is being put on the table to help this industry develop green technologies. I believe this is a corporate responsibility they can afford.<Sub></Sub></ParaText><ParaText id="1002326">In addition, in the last budget, there was a gradual withdrawal of the accelerated capital cost allowance for oil sands operations. We would have preferred that this measure be eliminated altogether, but it was nevertheless a step in the right direction. In this budget, the allowance has been reinstated for carbon dioxide pipeline developers. That means more money in support of polluters, who make large profits, so they can continue their exploration.<Sub></Sub></ParaText><ParaText id="1002327">This responsibility should be shouldered by producers.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002328">In closing, I will say that the budget allocates $12 million to national parks.

The House resumed from March 10 consideration of Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (cruelty to animals)</Document>, as reported (without amendment) from the committee, and of the motions in Group No. 1.
</ParaText><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Hubbard" id="2398515"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78827" Type="2">Hon. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1002340">Mr. Speaker, today we again bring before the House further discussion and debate on a bill dealing with animal cruelty. It has been a long journey. In fact, between the House of Commons and the Senate, this legislation has been debated over and over through different bills for more than a decade.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002341">We are really dealing this afternoon with Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document>, a bill that was presented in the Senate by Senator Bryden and which I introduced in the House some weeks ago. Basically we are dealing with amendments to the Criminal Code in sections 444 to 447.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002342">The debate of this has been long. It has affected many people. In fact, many members of Parliament are receiving emails from different groups who stand on different sides of Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002343">Today, I would like to present my argument in terms of the bill that has come from the Senate, a bill that reflects the need for changes in the Criminal Code which would place greater emphasis upon animal cruelty and to those who might be accused or involved with cruelty to animals.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002344">Many people are affected. In fact, when we looked at other bills in terms of Bill <Document DbId="514775" Type="3">C-10</Document> and so forth, we began to realize how broad our constituency was in dealing with those involved and affected by animals. We found in fact that one of the largest jurisdictions is with people who have family pets, but of course the livelihood of many people involved in farming is also affected by what we might do in the House in terms of legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002345">We found that universities and university researchers, and those involved in research for humans dealing with animals, have great concerns of what legislation might produce. We have minor groups such as those who maintain zoos and those who are involved with circuses. In the previous legislation, we were also involved with fishermen because fish became part of the debate on previous legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002346">Above all, we have hunters and trappers, many people in our first nations communities who historically depended upon wildlife for their livelihood.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002347">When we look at all these different groups, we look at what proposals come forward, what animal rights groups say to us, what pet owners say to us, and above all, those in our farming communities. It is interesting to note that in terms of pets, many Canadians have tremendous affection for the cats, dogs, horses, birds and those pets which they maintain in the vicinity of their homes.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002348">When we look at American statistics, this industry, the industry of providing health resources to pet owners, approaches $40 billion <?bk?>U.S.<?ek?> a year. So it is a growing industry. We have to respect and certainly pay great thanks to those who love their animals, those who care for them, those who maintain them, and those who are so interested in any legislation which the House and Parliament would provide.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002349">I am not sure that the Criminal Code is the right place. Probably in future parliaments, we will see special legislation outside the Criminal Code. In terms of animals and cruelty, and respect for animals, the care for animals, we also have our provinces who have a vested interest in some of this because in terms of our wildlife, most wildlife species are protected under provincial legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002350">However, I would like to answer a few of our critics who have called upon some members of Parliament not to support Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document>. I personally have some difficulty with that logic because Bill 203 does not preclude the necessity or the fact that further legislation could be brought to the House which would improve upon this legislation. It would tend to see that the various groups that I mentioned are not seriously and adversely affected. It would indeed demonstrate that all of us as Canadians can enjoy the fact that we as a Parliament and as a nation can see that our animals are properly protected and that we can find joy, warmth and comfort in the relations that we have with them.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1002351">Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document> basically deals with any person who kills, maims, wounds, poisons or injures cattle, or kills, maims, wounds, poisons or injures dogs, birds or animals that are not cattle and are kept for a lawful purpose. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002352">If people were to commit offences under the Criminal Code with that description of it, they could be charged with an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than five years. That is a very serious penalty for those who would be convicted. Furthermore, if the court should decide it is not an indictable offence, there could be fines of up to $10,000.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002353">This cruelty, in section 445.1, says that anyone who wilfully causes or, being the owner, wilfully permits to be caused unnecessary pain, suffering or injury to an animal or a bird or anyone who assists at the fighting or baiting of animals or birds, or promotes, arranges, conducts, assists in, receives money in such circumstances, can be convicted of an indictable offence and receive up to five years in prison.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002354">Section 446 goes on to state that anyone who, by wilful neglect, causes damage or injury to animals or who is involved with a domestic animal or a bird or an animal, whether it be wild in nature or in captivity, who abandons it in distress or wilfully neglects or fails to provide suitable and adequate food, water, shelter and care, would be committing an offence.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002355">Furthermore, Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document> also attempts to preclude from ownership of animals people who are guilty of these offences. The court, under section 447.1, may make an order prohibiting the accused from owning, having the custody or control of, residing in the same premise as an animal or bird during any period that the court considers appropriate, but in the case of a second or subsequent offence, a minimum of five years.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002356">What I am advocating today is that the House could approve at report stage and third reading this legislation. I know it is not perfect, but it is a tremendous improvement upon the present legislation which was put in place almost a century ago.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002357">There is another bill, in fact, that is before the House. It is further down than my own. However, there will be an opportunity in the future for another government or another member to bring a private member's bill before this assembly that can be debated. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002358">I hope that as time progresses we as Canadians can develop legislation which is valuable to all, protects our animals, birds and fish and, above all, does not cause harm or unjustness to our farmers, fishermen, and those who rely upon these species for their livelihood.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Fletcher" id="2398566"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78954" Type="18">Mr. Steven Fletcher (Parliamentary Secretary for Health, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1002359">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to rise to speak to Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document>, a bill introduced by Senator Bryden that would amend the animal cruelty provisions in the Criminal Code. Bill S-203 has passed the other place and has been reported back to the House by the justice committee, without amendment, and is now before this House for report stage and third reading.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002360">We have before us a private member's bill that has one simple objective, improving the law's ability to deter, denounce and punish animal cruelty and make offenders take greater responsibility for their crimes.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002361">In stating my support for Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document>, I recognize that some hon. members have expressed the view that they cannot support the bill because it does not address some limitations in the current law. It is true that Bill S-203 does not amend current offences or create new ones. However, as members well know, none of the bills introduced by the previous government over the course of about seven years ever pass both chambers.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002362">I would like to take this opportunity to speak to two motions to amend Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document>, which were recently tabled by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78397" Type="2">Windsor—Tecumseh</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002363">The first motion proposes to delete the long title of the bill. This motion is irrelevant to the objective of Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document>, which is to increase penalties for current offences. Therefore, I will be opposing the motion.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002364">The second motion is to delete clause 1 of the bill. The bill only has one clause and so that obviously is not warranted either. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002365">Thus, the combined effect of both motions would be to completely gut Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document> of its title and substantive provisions. I, for one, support Bill S-203 and anyone who does obviously will not support either motion.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002366">Hon. members are well aware that if Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document> is passed by this House with any amendments, the amended bill will have to go back to the other place for reconsideration. The report stage amendments tabled by the opposition are an obvious tactic to obstruct or delay any progress that we can make in strengthening our animal cruelty laws. I really have to question the logic and intent of this.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002367">Let us face it, Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document> is a step in the right direction, which in no way prevents any future legislation from being brought forward.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002368">Again, I have to question the motives of anyone who would want to prevent us from moving forward and strengthening our animal cruelty provisions today.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002369"> Sending the bill back to the other place raises the prospect that it will join a long list of previous formulations of animal cruelty amendments that were not supported by both Houses. This is unproductive and unnecessary.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002370">Some hon. members of the House have voiced criticism of what Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document> does not address. It is important to consider whether the increase in penalties in Bill S-203, coupled with the current animal cruelty provisions in the Criminal Code, would provide more protection to animals than if the bill had not been passed. I believe the answer to this question is a resounding yes. Moreover, increasing penalties with regard to animal cruelty has been one of the issues that all proponents of stronger animal cruelty legislation have been able to agree upon over the years.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002371">Currently, the Criminal Code provides a number of distinct animal cruelty offences. Some offences prohibit very specific forms of conduct and others are more general in nature. The offences are set out in sections 444 to 447 of the Criminal Code. The two most frequently charged offences are those of wilfully causing unnecessary pain, suffering or injury to an animal and causing pain, suffering or injury by neglect. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1002372">These types of actions are in fact what most Canadians think about when they think about animal cruelty. Cruelty can be intentional, meaning the result of conduct that a person knows will or would likely cause harm, or it can be the result of gross negligence or severe inadvertence.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002373">With respect to maximum available penalties, all offences, except those concerning cattle, are summary conviction offences only. This means that the maximum sentence an offender can get is six months in prison, a $2,000 fine, or both. This maximum applies no matter how heinous the act of cruelty may be.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002374">By contrast, offences in respect of cattle are pure indictable offences and subject to a ma maximum of five years imprisonment.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002375">One question raised by the law and addressed by Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document> is whether this distinction is still justified. I will return to this point in a moment.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002376">The Criminal Code also contains what is called a prohibition order. This mechanism allows a judge to order a convicted offender to refrain from owning an animal for up to two years.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002377">Prohibition orders are mostly preventive; they actually work to keep animals away from animal abusers. In this way they are aimed primarily at preventing future cruelty toward animals. Prohibition orders are imposed relatively often in animal cruelty cases. The courts clearly feel that the prohibition order is a valuable tool at their disposal in dealing with the people who abuse animals.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002378">Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document> proposes three changes to the current animal cruelty regime, all in the nature of penalty enhancements.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002379">All of the measures address concerns that have been identified with the existing law. There is strong agreement across all sectors that the low maximum penalties for cruelty are inadequate, both to denounce animal cruelty as unacceptable and to punish acts of cruelty when they do occur. Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document> responds to this concern and does so in the following three ways:</ParaText><ParaText id="1002380">First, Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document> would increase maximum terms of imprisonment. It would make all offences hybrid, meaning that the prosecutor may choose to proceed by way of summary conviction procedure or by way of indictment, depending on the seriousness of the case.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002381">Currently, all the offences, except those in relation to cattle, are straight summary conviction offences. These would be hybridized by Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002382">Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document> makes the distinction between penalties for two categories of offences: one for injuring animals intentionally or recklessly; and the second for injuring animals by criminal neglect, to which I have already alluded. This is an important distinction. Some people commit cruelty on purpose. Others commit cruelty by extreme neglect.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002383">Under traditional criminal law principles, knowingly or intentionally doing something is more blameworthy than doing the same thing by gross neglect.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002384">Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document> would introduce a new power to allow the sentencing judge to order the offender to repay the costs of medical care and other forms of care that another person or organization spent caring for the animal that was abused. This new power would be a means of holding the offender financially responsible for the costs of their crime. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002385">Those are the three principal amendments. Unfortunately, I was not able to elaborate on the second major one, but together they constitute a significant improvement to the current law and one with which all Canadians would agree.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002386">I encourage all hon. members to support Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document> and to oppose the two motions currently before the House.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mrs. Lavallée" id="2398572"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78473" Type="2">Mrs. Carole Lavallée (Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1002387">Mr. Speaker, true to its reputation, the Bloc Québécois carefully read Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document> when it was before the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. It listened with interest to the various witnesses and is well aware of the limitations of Bill S-203.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002388"> We are aware of the importance of properly protecting animals from cruelty, so we proposed a series of amendments to improve Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document>. Among our proposals was the idea of introducing a clear definition of what an animal is. We also sought to protect stray as well as domestic animals. We also wanted to clarify the criterion for negligence, thereby making it easier to prove. Finally, we also proposed an amendment to formally ban training cocks to fight. Unfortunately all the Bloc's proposed amendments were rejected and the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights agreed on February 14, 2008, to report the bill without amendments.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002389">That is not stopping the Bloc Québécois from supporting Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document> in that it is, in fact, a small but real step in the right direction and does not prevent the possible study and adoption of a more complete bill in line with Bill <Document DbId="1845039" Type="3">C-50</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002390">The Bloc Québécois does oppose the amendments proposed at report stage by the NDP. These amendments seek nothing less than to kill the bill. Their first amendment would remove the title and their second amendment would remove the rest. The NDP's logic in all this is especially twisted. Instead of voting in favour of an improvement to the legislation, even though we know a lot remains to be done—it is true—the NDP prefers the status quo that it nonetheless vehemently criticizes. Where is the logic in that?</ParaText><ParaText id="1002391">If the NDP truly had animal protection at heart, it would act differently. It would follow the Bloc Québécois' example and act responsibly. Although the Bloc Québécois is aware of the limitations of Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document>, it finds that this bill is a small but real step in the right direction, and does not hinder the possible study and adoption of another bill I will speak about shortly. The Bloc Québécois is making no secret of this. It is in favour of a real reform of the animal cruelty provisions and will seriously study this matter again, unlike our colleagues, apparently.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002392">Introduced by the Senate, Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document> is the result of a long legislative process. Indeed, in recent years, six bills were introduced by the Liberal government of the day, specifically, Bill <Document DbId="514775" Type="3">C-10</Document>, Bill <Document DbId="940851" Type="3">C-10B</Document>, Bill <Document DbId="69285" Type="3">C-15B</Document>, Bill <Document DbId="9801" Type="3">C-17</Document>, Bill <Document DbId="1221396" Type="3">C-22</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="1845039" Type="3">C-50</Document>. To those we can add those proposed by the Senate, namely, Bill S-24 and Bill <Document DbId="2582083" Type="4">S-213</Document>, the two predecessors of Bill S-203.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002393">All those bills sought to modify the offences set out in the part of the Criminal Code that deals with cruelty to animals. Some of the bills went even further, however, and proposed real reforms to this bill. The Bloc was particularly in favour of the principle of Bill <Document DbId="1845039" Type="3">C-50</Document>, which would have created a new section in the Criminal Code to address cruelty to animals, removing this topic from the sections of the code that deal with property. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002394">However, since that reform raised a number of problems, Bill S-24 was introduced in the meantime, to allow much more modest changes. Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document> is a copy of Bill <Document DbId="2582083" Type="4">S-213</Document>, which was itself a copy of Bill S-24—I hope people are able to follow me.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002395">The Bloc Québécois is in favour of Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document>, even though we are aware that it does not go far enough. But it is better than nothing. Such a bill will send a message to anyone who mistreats animals. Protecting animals against certain despicable actions will always remain a concern of the Bloc Québécois. The current maximum sentences under the Criminal Code are too lenient for the seriousness of the acts committed.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002396">The bill does not jeopardize legitimate activities involving animal death, such as agriculture, hunting and fishing. This bill, however, is less comprehensive and therefore does not replace Bill <Document DbId="3073281" Type="4">C-373</Document>, which is a revival of Bill <Document DbId="1845039" Type="3">C-50</Document>. However, we are not here to discuss that bill today.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002397">The bill amends the Criminal Code to increase the maximum sentences in cases of cruelty to animals. For prosecution by indictment, the maximum sentence is five years. For summary convictions, sentences can range from six to 18 months, along with a possible $10,000 fine.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1002398">In the past, judges could prohibit those found guilty from owning or residing with animals for up to two years. Now that ban can be for life. The judge can now require the offender to reimburse costs arising from his or her actions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002399">Obviously, the bill does not solve all of the existing problems. As I said earlier, this is a baby step, but these new penalties will provide better protection for animals until such time as animal cruelty provisions can be reformed significantly.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002400">By increasing the penalties, we are sending a message to criminals as well as to the judges who have to take this into account in sentencing. The seriousness of a crime is determined in part by the maximum penalty that can be imposed on an offender.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002401">We are also hoping that by making the ban on owning animals indefinite, we will be able to prevent some animal abuse from taking place.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002402">The bill we are considering this afternoon has three major advantages. First, it corrects an anachronism. When the Criminal Code was first drafted back in the 19th century, society did not regard animals the way it does now. The relationships between people and animals have changed, so it makes sense for the Criminal Code to reflect that. Everyone agrees that the current penalties are not severe enough. Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document> goes a little way toward correcting the old-fashioned, weak penalties. The old penalties were based on how people interacted with animals in the 19th century.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002403">The second good thing about this bill is the fact that, as penalties become more severe, there is a good chance that the courts will become stricter with those who are found guilty of crimes against animals, such as mutilation, slaughter, neglect, abandonment, or failure to feed them. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002404">This bill would change the minimum sentence. From now on, if a case is tried as an indictable offence, the minimum sentence will be five years in jail. The fine will go up to $10,000. As it happens, both of these provisions are in the member for <Affiliation DbId="78329" Type="2">Ajax—Pickering</Affiliation>'s bill, Bill <Document DbId="3073281" Type="4">C-373</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002405">There is another excellent change. Henceforth, a court may ban an animal owner for life—or I should say a former owner—from having an animal in his possession. Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document> will now allow a court to impose a prohibition order for life on this owner, whereas the current legislation provides for a two-year prohibition.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002406">The third and last advantage of this bill is that it provides for restitution mechanisms through which the courts can order an individual to pay the costs if an animal has been taken in by an animal welfare organization, for example. Individuals who committed offences of negligence or intentional cruelty could be forced to pay the organizations that have taken in mistreated animals. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002407">These three benefits alone represent a considerable improvement and warrant our support of this bill. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002408"> A number of our constituents have written to us comparing this Senate bill and the bill introduced by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78329" Type="2">Ajax—Pickering</Affiliation> to be debated later.

It was to delete the bill simply because the bill is wrong. He put the amendment forward because this a bill that does not deserve to be passed. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002412">My friend from Winnipeg should know that the member for <Affiliation DbId="78397" Type="2">Windsor—Tecumseh</Affiliation> did not fall off the turnip wagon. He knew exactly what he was doing. He was ensuring that this bill would not go further.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002413">It is strange that, at the same as the Liberals have one of their members putting forward a progressive piece of legislation that is a private member's initiative, they would even think of supporting Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document>. Why would the Liberals settle for half measures?</ParaText><ParaText id="1002414"> I hope the members of the Liberal Party will take stock of the bill and the juxtaposition between Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="3073281" Type="4">C-373</Document>, the private member's initiative from the member from Pickering.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002415">I have a comment for my friends from the Bloc. The point that has been made time and again is that this is not good enough. In fact, the Bloc knows that when my colleague from Windsor—Tecumseh brought forward amendments at committee to replace this bill with what is progressive legislation, which was actually Bill <Document DbId="1845039" Type="3">C-50</Document>, that was the time for us to change the bill. However, sadly, that did not get the support of all the members of the committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002416">What is wrong with the bill? I guess I will start with the people who, day in and day out, advocate for more responsible animal welfare. These people are not extremists. These people are responsible citizens. They are looking at the proposition that was brought forward by one of the members of the Liberal Party, which we support, as being the way to go. They believe that Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document> will only take us half way. What is the problem with that? The problem is that this issue has been languishing since the 1800s. It puts Canada at the bottom of the list in terms of progress on animal welfare globally in progressive circles. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002417">In fact, if we adopt Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document>, it says that it is as good as we could get. Every member who has spoken today has said that it is okay because it is the best we can do for now. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002418">That is not good enough. It is not good enough for this House because this House, before, passed progressive legislation that was much better than this, which is a cut and paste, so to speak, from the member from Pickering's bill, and that was Bill <Document DbId="1845039" Type="3">C-50</Document>. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002419">What happened to Bill <Document DbId="1845039" Type="3">C-50</Document>? It went to that other place and got done in, which is part of our problem with the other place. It has decent people there but the institution has absolutely no right to take a bill that has been passed by consensus here and gone through committee and then let it sit there. It is wrong, and most Canadians feel that way about it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002420">In fact, I was honoured to join people this past weekend in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="78922" Type="2">Ottawa Centre</Affiliation> just down the street from here. I joined in with everyday people who asked all members of Parliament to vote against Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document> because it is the wrong way to go. They say that very deliberately, with conviction and with great intelligence. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002421">In fact, Simone Powell and Beth Greenhorn from my riding, who helped organize a rally this past weekend, said just that. They wanted to know why members of Parliament were going to pass a bill that is inferior when we have progressive legislation right in front. I told them I had no idea why.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="00">(1400)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1002422">The NDP has been very clear. We will be supporting Bill <Document DbId="3073281" Type="4">C-373</Document> but we will be voting against Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document> because it is the wrong way to go. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002423">We have a party that says that this bill is the best that can be done at this point. We took the content from Bill C-373, which was Bill <Document DbId="1845039" Type="3">C-50</Document>, and put it into committee as amendments so this bill might have a chance of working but members from the other parties did not want to do that. They did not want to be responsible for animal welfare.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002424">I will explain some of the problems with the bill. We are taking laws from the 1800s and basically moving a nanosecond in terms of progress. We do not understand that it is wrong to have this kind of protection in property rights. It reminds me of the time in Canadian history when women were not considered persons. We now have animals considered as properties. The problem with the law is that it is wrong.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002425">For anyone to suggest that we just torque up some of the fines and pass a law that will suggest that judges have a little more in their toolkits to extend the sentences is troubling and strange, particularly for the Conservative Party, which is saying that we need to be very deliberate with judges and tell them exactly how it is.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002426">My friends in the Liberal Party should know that in making laws in legislation we must be deliberate. We must categorize them. Nomenclature is extremely important. If we are not able to properly define animals, animal welfare and understand where it belongs in terms of the law, then we should not bother trying to fix something that is not fixable because that is the problem with Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document>. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002427">The bill says to Canadians that we can only do a little bit, that we cannot actually do the right thing. We can only do a little bit and we will eventually get to it and fix it down the road, maybe with Bill <Document DbId="3073281" Type="4">C-373</Document>, if it comes on the order paper later, or if it is a matter of having others put proposals forward.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002428">Why is it that with each proposal that has been put forward since 1999, all of them have died on the order paper? Why do they die when they go to the other place? Canadians want to know that. People who work for the protection of animals want to know why that is.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002429">This is something that has been pointed out to those who are looking to have more progressive legislation and are 100% against Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document>. They have said the following: </ParaText><ParaText id="1002430"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">It is shameful that, in 2008, our parliament is considering entrenching animal cruelty offences from the Victorian days.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1002431">Further to that, they say:</ParaText><ParaText id="1002432"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">This bill is simply 19th century legislation adjusted for inflation and we must put a stop to it.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1002433">I could not agree more. If we do not address the loopholes that exist in Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document>, we are admitting that we cannot fix the problem. It means that either we do not understand the problem or we do not care to fix the problem. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002434">Again, why is it that when this place, through consensus in committee back three parliaments, passes a bill and sends it to the other place, the other place decides that it is not good enough? With all due respect, the Senate does not represent my constituents. The Senate should be saying that this is what the House has given to it and it needs to ensure it gets through and that it is responsible. Its decision to kill the bill was not only reprehensible but it was anti-democratic.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002435">At the end, our party will stand with those who want better legislation, progressive legislation, which is why we will vote against Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document> and, in doing so, will vote to protect animal welfare and not go backward.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="05">(1405)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Szabo" id="2398588"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78477" Type="2">Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1002436">Mr. Speaker, as the member in our caucus who coordinates private members' business, I have followed this bill very carefully. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002437">It is a bill by Senator John Bryden, who was successful in having the bill move through all stages in the Senate. It has been passed in the Senate and has been referred to the House of Commons and is now being sponsored by the member who tabled the bill here.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002438">It is a very simple bill. It increases penalties, I believe up to 10 years. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002439">Having spent all the time working on private members' business, in my experience private members' bills should not try to do government business, because our rules simply do not provide sufficient debate in Parliament to properly scrutinize any private member's bill. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002440">Private members' bills that come before this place are usually a paragraph long. They are simply trying to make a very specific, focused change. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002441">Under our rules, only two hours of debate are allowed at second reading. That might be 12 speakers. Of the 308 members, only 12 people could even speak.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002442">Then the bill goes to committee. Committees are busy. Private members' business items are a nuisance and they very rarely get a lot of attention there, but let us assume the committee spends a meeting on one. That is another couple of hours. Then the bill is referred back to the House, if it passes at committee, and it gets another two hours at report stage and third reading. In grand total, a private member's bill at all stages in the House may only get six hours of debate. It is ridiculous to think that one could do very much at all stages in just six hours.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002443">Senator Bryden was aware of that. He knew that the only way he could demonstrate the importance of updating animal cruelty legislation was at least to take one step, one step that everybody would understand and that people would be able to take a position on without a lot of debate, because there is not a lot of debate. That is where we are today.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002444">Interestingly enough, there is another private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="3073281" Type="4">C-373</Document>, by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78329" Type="2">Ajax—Pickering</Affiliation>. That bill was Bill <Document DbId="1845039" Type="3">C-50</Document> from a prior Parliament. The justice minister of the day, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78453" Type="2">Mount Royal</Affiliation>, had this bill. It was a comprehensive bill but a controversial bill nonetheless. It was quite controversial. There was a lot of debate. There were a lot of issues and a lot of changes were being proposed.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002445">That is going to happen again with a full, comprehensive bill to update this archaic piece of legislation in the manner in which it is needed. We cannot possibly deal with it during private members' business. There just is not enough time to properly consider the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002446">I am speaking in favour of Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document> for the reason that Senator Bryden proposed it, and that is to say, I do not see the government having an appetite to do this. It should be a government bill. It should have the broadest possible and necessary debate within the House to make sure when we correct this that we do the job right, and we cannot do it right in a private member's bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002447">The possibility was suggested that maybe we could do this by getting a private member's bill into committee and then making all of the amendments to almost overlay this other bill into the small bill. I have a feeling that probably would not be possible, only because it would be beyond the scope of the bill and it probably would be out of order. There may be some problems. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002448">There also have been some myths about Bill <Document DbId="3073281" Type="4">C-373</Document>. Many people have written to me saying that I have to vote against Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document> because if that passes, then nobody will have any incentive to make any changes in the future, that it will have been already dealt with.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="10">(1410)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1002449">That is not right. Any piece of legislation can be amended at any time and from time to time. This is one demonstration of the importance of this issue. I hope that the House as a whole would agree that we need to have changes to the animal cruelty legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002450">This bill should in fact be the catalyst to get the government to propose legislation. I encourage and sincerely ask the government to please come forward with legislation which emulates Bill <Document DbId="1845039" Type="3">C-50</Document> and any other improvements in there that would make the bill even better. Give that bill to the House and let us work with it. It has to be a government bill. If it is not a government bill, it will never get the proper time for debate and the scrutiny that will be necessary to make a good piece of legislation.That is the real problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002451">To suggest that if we pass<Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document> it is going to stop anything, that is simply not the case. It is incorrect. There will be changes in the future, but unless the House is going to have a piece of legislation in front of it that members can properly address, I do not think it is going to happen. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002452">I can say for sure that if the Liberals form the next government, it will be part of our platform to introduce comprehensive legislation to bring it up to date, into the current realities, on animal cruelty legislation. It is an important piece. We had it the last time we formed government. The then minister of justice, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78453" Type="2">Mount Royal</Affiliation>, had Bill <Document DbId="1845039" Type="3">C-50</Document> and it will come back.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002453">Bill <Document DbId="3073281" Type="4">C-373</Document> is in front of me. It is quite a long bill. These are just the amendments to the existing legislation. There are six pages of amendments. No one is saying that six pages of amendments even in themselves are going to be enough. We need to have comprehensive debate on this legislation when it comes before the House. It needs to go to committee. We need to hear from stakeholders from across the country, those who represent the agricultural industry, farmers, fishermen, anglers, pet owners and those who just understand that we have legislation right now on which it is very difficult to get prosecutions and convictions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002454">It is a serious problem and Parliament should deal with it. The only way it can deal with it right now is either to have the government table a bill at least covering the items in Bill <Document DbId="1845039" Type="3">C-50</Document> from a prior Parliament or at least to pass Bill <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document> to send a signal to Canadians that this is an issue that is important enough to Parliament that we will set the stage for the government to take action. And if it does not, then another party forming government will in fact bring it in. We had it before. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002455">The NDP members are against everything these days. I do not know what it is. I know they have talked about maybe asking the Liberal member to give up his bill, give it to the NDP and one of its members will do it, but it is not going to work. </ParaText><ParaText id="1002456">We all have to understand that with a private member's bill we are not going to get unanimous consent to do the kinds of things we have to do. It is not going to happen in this mix of the House. We need to have a bill that has that full and comprehensive debate, to make sure that all the questions that people have from coast to coast to coast are answered and that the legislation reflects the priorities of Canadians with regard to animal cruelty legislation. We have to hear that and we will not hear that on a private member's bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="1002457">I acknowledge 100% that <Document DbId="3144131" Type="4">S-203</Document> takes one small step.
