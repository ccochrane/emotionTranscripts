							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4192158">The main principle of the bill was that all federally regulated workers should have the right to a free secret ballot vote when deciding to certify or decertify a union.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4192159">The card check system that had apparently been in place for federally regulated industries required 50% plus one of workers' union membership cards for union certification. This system was open to co-workers and other interested parties potentially pressuring employees into signing union cards. Rather than an automatic certification of a union process, the previous bill required a 50% plus one majority of votes cast in a secret ballot to support certification at a meeting for certification or decertification.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192160">The principle behind this is similar to what we all undergo here in a general election. </ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4192161">Just as the secret ballot of a general election represents the voice of each elector, a secret ballot on certification would allow employees to freely express their wishes. </ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4192162">Many Canadians do not want to reveal who they voted for in a general election. I am sure that members experienced that as often as I did when they were going door to door in the last federal election. Some people are quite free in expressing how they are going to vote, but many would rather keep that to themselves.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192163">Workers should be provided that same level of comfort in expressing their views, choosing to either express them publicly or to have the privacy of a secret ballot vote in the workplace, a place where they spend by far the majority of their time. They should be made to feel welcome and comfortable, no matter what their choice, in all circumstances.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4192164">The bill ensured that there was a framework in place to allow those workers to express their personal position.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4192165">One other change in the previous bill was the proposal to set the threshold of employee support required to trigger certification or decertification at 40%. It was amended to 40% so that the trigger was the same either way, which it had not been prior to this legislation. It would be the same for certification or decertification, the same to get in and the same to get out.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4192166">This number is more reflective of international conventions and the majority of provincial statutes. In fact, five provinces currently have this threshold or higher. I believe this approach is fair and creates a level playing field for both supporters and opponents in situations where the question of certification or decertification is at stake.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4192167">As I said before, the creation of the new legislation was about making sure that workers are able to express themselves as they deem fit in their workplaces, allowing both those who are opponents or partisans supporting accreditation or decertification to express their views.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192168">As I have said, it makes sense to me that we use a system for the democratic rights of workers, but it apparently also makes eminent sense to workers. Polling data on unionized and non-unionized employees across the country shows overwhelming support for a secret ballot vote on questions of certification and decertification. This seems fair to me. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4192169">Poll after poll indicates that, since 2003, support across Canada for secret ballot voting has rated between 83% and 89%, with some of the highest results coming from unionized or formerly unionized employees. </ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4192170">Clearly, Canadians believe that we should take important steps to secure this fundamental right for employees in federally regulated workplaces.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192171"> As Canadians, we have taken great pride in our democratic processes. The secret ballot is the hallmark of our modern democracy here in Canada. It is a system we support so strongly that Canadians have not only shed blood for our country to maintain its democracy but have actually spent significant amounts of time in other countries to help them achieve that same degree of freedom and democracy.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192172">I ask how it could be undemocratic, as has been mentioned in the House by other members, to provide workers with a secret ballot vote. We know that PSAC has stated at committee that it uses a secret ballot vote itself for internal elections as well as for collective bargaining agreement ratification. Every member in the House was elected by a secret ballot vote. </ParaText><ParaText id="4192173">As Justice Richards' stated in his ruling in the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, “The secret ballot, after all, is a hallmark of modern democracy”.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4192174">Due to this basic principle, this basic value that I think all Canadians hold dear, I would encourage all members in the House to vote against the current bill being considered and maintain the bill of the MP from <Affiliation DbId="214218" Type="2">Red Deer—Lacombe</Affiliation>. It is a common sense bill that makes the certification and decertification process for unions a democratic one in which all workers have a voice and can express that voice in the way they deem appropriate, in a comfortable manner, in their own workplaces. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It creates unnecessary red tape for labour organizations and labour trusts. Legislation is already in place to ensure that unions are financially accountable to their members. Therefore, I am wondering what the real reason was for the government at the time bringing forward this unfair legislation that brings extra red tape.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It was not government legislation. I think all Canadians agree, though, and I am sure the member would agree, that with regard to the bill I was speaking to, another private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="6251920" Type="4">C-525</Document>, a democratic, transparent process is what is most appropriate. </ParaText><ParaText id="4192177">For me, particularly as I spoke today about Bill C-525, making sure that we have a secret ballot vote is essential.

I also recall that professional associations, which also collect dues that are tax deductible, were not included in the bill. </ParaText><ParaText id="4192180">It was therefore abundantly clear to me that this was a direct attack on how unions operate, particularly regarding the issue of unions having to show their accounting records. Obviously, this gives negotiators on the management side an advantage, since they would then be familiar with the financial position of the unions with which they are negotiating.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192181">Why will the Conservative members not just admit that those two bills were a deliberate attack on unions in order to undermine their ability to stand up to the government, which was extremely harmful over the past four years? </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The first thing the Liberals did, or the second, perhaps we will give them that, was introduce this legislation to repeal a bill, whose importance the member and other speakers have done such a marvellous job of helping Canadians understand, rather than talking about the economic conditions in the west, the pipelines issue, dairy farmers' concerns with TPP, refugees, the Armed Forces, and so many other issues. </ParaText><ParaText id="4192184">Why did the Liberal government choose to target this legislation as its first act when it came to power?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Today they are asking why the current government is not focused on the TPP. A number of individuals in my riding are involved in the agriculture community, whether they are farmers or people getting that produce to market. Why did the current government not mention agriculture in its throne speech? Why is it that we are focused on something that takes a system that was created to make people equivalent, where certification and decertification are both at 40%, an in and out equivalent, and there is a secret ballot vote, which they now would like to reverse? </ParaText><ParaText id="4192186">I would ask the government on the opposite side when it will take care of farmers.

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Sopuck" id="8783292"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="214448" Type="2">Mr. Robert Sopuck (Dauphin—Swan River—Neepawa, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4192187">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to follow my esteemed colleague regarding the Liberals' intent to repeal Bill <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="6251920" Type="4">C-525</Document>. </ParaText><ParaText id="4192188">Both of these bills were about transparency. As my colleague talked about earlier, the first bills we introduced as a government were about increasing transparency, and one of the first acts of the Liberal government is to introduce bills to reduce transparency.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192189">Bill <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document> had an important purpose. The purpose was to extend the principle of public disclosure to a group of institutions that enjoy substantial public benefit: labour organizations. This is key. Public disclosure would increase the confidence of Canadians that unions spend their money wisely and effectively. </ParaText><ParaText id="4192190">Regarding Bill <Document DbId="6251920" Type="4">C-525</Document>, which dealt with the issue of voting rights, it replaced a system called “card check”. The card check system allows for a workplace to be unionized without allowing all employees to express their opinions. In fact, the unionization of a workplace could occur without a significant portion of the bargaining unit having been made aware of it.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192191">Again, both of these bills dealt with improving transparency. In our strong view, Canadian union workers have the right to know how their mandatory union dues are spent. That is why our government passed Bill <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="6251920" Type="4">C-525</Document>.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4192192">Repealing these laws sends a very clear message: the Liberal government cares more about thanking union bosses, who did everything in their power to help them get elected, rather than the thousands of hard-working union members whose dues were spent without consultation. Union leaders need to be held accountable and tell their members and the public how their tax-advantaged income is spent.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192193"> The Conservative Party will continue to support union transparency and stand up for union workers. As I have said in a couple of my other speeches, it is becoming quite clear that the only party that cares about Canadian workers and workers' families is the Conservative Party of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192194">Even some labour organizations are very strongly in favour of our bill. The Christian Labour Association, Dick Heinen, the executive director, in February 2014, said:</ParaText><ParaText id="4192195"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> Now fundamentally, CLAC believes in competition in the labour relations environment in Canada.

							<ParaText id="4192197"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> FETCO members prefer a secret ballot vote to a card-check system for the purpose of determining if a union is to become a certified bargaining agent for employees. A secret ballot vote is the essence of a true democratic choice and is entirely consistent with Canadian democratic principles. It allows each and every employee to express their true wishes without undue influence or disclosure of how they cast their ballot. This is the mechanism that is used for the electoral process in Canada, and it is the fairest process. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4192198">It is no coincidence that the public sector union bosses worked hard to get the Liberal government elected, and now, quite frankly, it is payback time. The first thing that the Liberal government is doing is repealing these two very important bills, Bill <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="6251920" Type="4">C-525</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192199">In addition, the <Affiliation DbId="214341" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> made a point of announcing that he is restoring the sick leave benefit to the public sector. That is a cost of $900 million a year. That is $900 million that is not available for health care, the environment, agriculture, and infrastructure. However, again we can see it is definitely payback time. Now we have a government that is beholden to public sector union bosses. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4192200"> Quite interestingly, what I am seeing in the House and in government is a merging of the ideology of the Liberals and the NDP. We have the champagne socialists riding with the limousine Liberals. Quite frankly, the NDP has not changed. It is still the party of bad ideas and toxic policies. What is changing is the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party is moving very quickly to the left, and their alliance with public sector union bosses against the interest of Canadians in general is proof of that.</ParaText>

They are the Liberals who actually cared about business. They were the prominent blue Liberals who were talking in favour of pipelines, economic development, and free trade. However, they are being completely ignored. I think the Species at Risk Act needs to look at the blue Liberal.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192202">Given that it is payback time, let us imagine what is going on in the negotiation room between the government and the public sector unions. Do members not think for a minute that the public sector unions do not point their finger at the relevant Liberal negotiators and say, “Look, we got you elected and you better deliver”? The Liberal Party is bargaining with the same group that helped bring it into power. </ParaText><ParaText id="4192203">The <Affiliation DbId="214341" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> is making a sham trying to talk tough, but we know what will really go on behind closed doors. These negotiations are fundamentally flawed. There is another word I could use, but it is quite unparliamentary. The negotiations will be all about how much they can fleece the taxpayer.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4192204">Unfortunately, the public sector unions have become an entity unto themselves. We see the evolution of public sector unions as powerful political entities that in some cases can determine who forms a government. The public sector unions will always remind the Liberals who got them elected, and the public interest itself will be left behind. </ParaText><ParaText id="4192205">This is bad for democracy and it is bad for our country. The public service is supposed to be neutral and carry out the wishes of the duly elected government of the day, but the trends I am seeing make me very uneasy. </ParaText><ParaText id="4192206">Again, I want to reiterate that as this session evolves and the legislation evolves, it is becoming quite clear that the Conservative Party of Canada is the only party that stands up for the workers of Canada. We defend the natural resource industries. We defend the oil sands. We encourage the growth of pipelines. We are the only people who care about working families in this country.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It was a clear policy, and it earned the support of Canadians. It was a policy that got to the heart of what Canadians wanted vis-à-vis the balance of workers and employer rights at the federal level, and people swarmed to it. It was not a situation where the Liberal Party of Canada was cowing to the desires of unions.

It was through his hard work and passionate commitment that my family prospered and that I, with my brothers and sister, were able to build lives founded on security and stability. In fact, my sister, my brothers, my mother, and I all worked in the steel industry.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4192223">While Dofasco was never unionized, it benefited from what other unions in Hamilton attained. The hard-won achievements of unionized labour set an example for my father's employer to give its workers comparable rights, safety, and wages. This is but one very personal example of how unions directly and indirectly have improved the lives of Hamiltonians.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192224">When conditions are at their best, unions, employers, and government work together to build safe, prosperous, and stable communities.

It was in Hamilton that the movement for the nine-hour workday in Canada was started. It was in Hamilton in 1920 that Katie McVicar and Mary McNab, who were shoe workers and members of the Knights of Labour, fought for the rights of women to join the labour force and to be respected. </ParaText><ParaText id="4192226">It was in Hamilton in 1935 that steelworkers organized a strike. Their employer did not accede to their demands. However, a greater victory was achieved. The union expanded to include all workers, regardless of skill or nationality. That was progress. These are the footings of the middle class in Hamilton: strong, built of cement, steel and hard work, wrought by the hands of people who believed in themselves and in one another.</ParaText>

It is through the labour movement and through their fight for fair wages, fair benefits, and safe working conditions that my family and our family prospered in Canada. We owe it to a strong middle class.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192266">If passed, Bill <Document DbId="8073132" Type="3">C-4</Document> would repeal the legislative changes made by Bill <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="6251920" Type="4">C-525</Document>, both of which have undermined labour unions and labour relations in our country. Let me tell members how.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192267">I will start with Bill <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192268">Bill C-377 amended the Income Tax Act to require all labour organizations and labour trusts across Canada to provide very detailed financial and other information to the Minister of National Revenue. This information would then be made available to the public on the Canada Revenue Agency's website. If labour organizations do not comply with these rules, they would face hefty fines.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4192269">At first glance, these new reporting requirements might seem like a good thing; sharing financial information promotes transparency and accountability. I am sure members of the House would agree that is a worthy goal. I do. However, and there is a big however, if we examine the bill further, we will find that in fact it discriminates against labour unions.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192270">First, Bill <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document> discriminates against unions because it places onerous, unfair public reporting obligations on them that do not apply to other organizations, such as professional associations that benefit from similar treatment under the Income Tax Act.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192271">Why is this onerous task imposed on unions alone? Why tip the scales? Perhaps these financial reporting requirements would be justified if similar requirements did not already exist elsewhere, but they do. </ParaText><ParaText id="4192272">Unions already are required to disclose financial information to their members under the Canada Labour Code and many provincial labour relations statutes. This includes British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and the beautiful province of Newfoundland and Labrador. </ParaText><ParaText id="4192273">In addition to Bill <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document> discriminating against unions, it is also unnecessary. It creates an extra administrative burden, just another layer of red tape. The Liberal Party of Canada does not like red tape.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192274">There is another reason that the bill is inherently unfair to labour unions. Simply put, it creates an imbalance between unions and employers during the collective bargaining process. How exactly? By giving employers access to key union information, without employers being required to share similar information. This makes for a very uneven playing field during the collective bargaining process.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4192275"> For example, employers would know how much money the union had in a strike fund for a possible work stoppage and how long they could stay out if it came to a strike. This clearly undermines the union's most important negotiating lever.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192276"> I would like to move on to Bill <Document DbId="6251920" Type="4">C-525</Document>, which Bill <Document DbId="8073132" Type="3">C-4</Document> would also repeal.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192277"> Bill C-525 changed the way that unions were certified and decertified under the Canada Labour Code, the Parliamentary Employment and Staff Relations Act and the Public Service Labour Relations Act. It replaced what is known as a card check system with a mandatory vote system.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192278"> For decades, and I emphasize decades, prior to Bill <Document DbId="6251920" Type="4">C-525</Document> coming into force, if a union demonstrated that a majority of workers had signed union cards, the union could be certified as the bargaining agent for those workers. A vote was only required if less than a majority signed, but there was still enough to indicate a strong interest. Under the Canada Labour Code, it was 35% of workers. Bill C-525 changed that to require that unions show at least 40% membership support before holding a secret ballot vote and to require a vote even where more than 50% of workers had signed a union membership card. </ParaText><ParaText id="4192279">More important, Bill <Document DbId="6251920" Type="4">C-525</Document> also makes it easier for unions to be decertified. It lowers the threshold to trigger a decertification vote from majority support to 40%. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4192280">Overall, as stakeholders such as the Canadian Union of Public Employees have pointed out, the card check model is faster, more efficient and more likely to be free of employer interference than the new method.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192281"> In short, Bill <Document DbId="6251920" Type="4">C-525</Document> makes it harder for employees to unionize and makes it easier for a union to be decertified. It tips the scales in an unbalanced manner. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="45">(1045)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4192282">Bill <Document DbId="6251920" Type="4">C-525</Document> made significant changes to a system that worked. There was a democratic and fair system in place for employees for decades to express their support for a union. A card check system relies on majority support, a key democratic principle.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192283"> The bottom line is that Bill <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document> and Bill C-525 upset the delicate balance between the rights of employers and the rights of employees. The bill put before the House, Bill <Document DbId="8073132" Type="3">C-4</Document>, seeks to repeal the legislative changes made by these two bills. It seeks to restore the rights of labour organizations in our proud country.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192284">Unifor's national president, Jerry Dias, welcomes Bill <Document DbId="8073132" Type="3">C-4</Document>. He said, “we have simply been given back rights that were taken from us”. Why are these rights so important? Because the rights of labour unions and the workers they represent are also the rights of Canadians. Who are those Canadians? They are carpenters, electricians, plumbers, and cleaners, the people we encounter everyday. They are Canadians who are working hard to put money in their banks and to save for their children's future.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4192285">As elected officials, we have a responsibility to protect those rights. Labour unions advocate for decent wages and safe working environments.

This report revealed that residents are still struggling and still need the support of members of the House. I think that all parliamentarians here would publicly agree to support the people of Lac-Mégantic, who have suffered as a result of this tragedy. I urge the government to work with all parliamentarians to help everyone get through this tragedy, which was, of course, a very difficult experience for the people of Lac-Mégantic. We will have to use the necessary resources, and we will all work together, across party lines, in a non-partisan and non-political manner, to ensure that the people of Lac-Mégantic get the services they need.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192586">I want to start by saying that my speech on Bill <Document DbId="8073132" Type="3">C-4</Document> is in no way an attack on unions or union leaders, and is certainly not an attack on the unionized workers who work hard to earn a living and support their families.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4192587">What I would like to talk about today is in fact the thousands of workers who have no corporate or partisan interests. They are happy in their jobs. They like being properly represented by their unions, and when they go home at night, they are just as happy to be with their families and forget about work until the next morning. That is the daily life of most workers, those whose voices we do not hear, those whom we tend to take for granted.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192588">Here in the House and at the various levels of government, whether local, provincial, or federal, many people claim that they speak for those silent workers. Lobby groups and unions all claim that they speak on behalf of all of their members and in their place. It is easy to do so, because those individuals do not hear us. They do not attend meetings with the decision-makers and, at the risk of disappointing members, when they go home tonight, they probably will not read today's <I>Hansard</I>.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4192589">Why? Because they are busy. They work hard to earn their paycheques and take care of their families and their homes. They are also busy paying the bills. They expect us, their MPs, to do our work like they do theirs. They expect us to take care of business in our ridings and in our country, to manage their money as though it were our own, and to build a better future for Canada. That is what those thousands of workers expect from us.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192590">They expect that from their union too. They expect their union representatives to deal with their working conditions and employer-employee relations and to be there when problems crop up. Like us, union representatives are elected. Like us, they do their best to represent their members, as we do for our constituents.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192591">I would like to take a moment to thank the unions that have helped build the country we have now by improving the lives of all workers.</ParaText>

Often those people are not even co-workers.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192594">I cannot see how a worker is supposed to refuse to sign when those three or four people threaten to stay at his apartment, home, or the restaurant where he is eating, until they get what they want.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192595">The legislation gave that worker a way out by ensuring that his final decision would be made by secret ballot. In other words, when faced with two or three individuals insisting that they would not leave his home until he signs the card, he could always say yes, knowing that he had a way out. </ParaText>

That is the truth. I have to wonder why certain unions still use such methods to represent workers. Are they truly trying to defend the interests of their members or future members? Or are they simply acting in their corporate interest, to grow their own organization and to get the associated union dues?</ParaText><ParaText id="4192598">What is really at stake with this old method is workers' money.

Those statements were then explained.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192608">That is electioneering, and it was paid for with public funds.

On one page, the unions claimed to understand workers' values better than did the workers themselves. It read, “your values and vision for the future”. The unions were telling workers what to think. That is what they told unionized workers using Canadian taxpayers' money.</ParaText>

With Bill C-4, our government would repeal both of these punitive pieces of legislation. </ParaText><ParaText id="4192664">The reasons we are doing this are threefold. The old combination of legislation under Bills <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document> and <Document DbId="6251920" Type="4">C-525</Document> was unnecessary, impeded collective bargaining, and was ideologically driven.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4192665">Argument number one is that the old legislation is unnecessary. No one asked for Bills <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document> and <Document DbId="6251920" Type="4">C-525</Document>. Employees did not ask for them, unions did not ask for them, and even employers were not clamouring for this legislation. These bills constituted a solution to a problem that did not even exist. The only champions of Bills C-377 and C-525 were the members of the previous government. The ostensible reason they asserted was that they were trying to promote increased financial transparency and accountability for unions and to inject democratic principles into their processes. This rationale was defective then, and it remains defective now. First, to the idea that unions are not transparent and that members do not get to see the financial statements or expenditures, this information was and has always been made available to union members. Unions are member-based organizations that release information to their members, information that is confidential. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4192666">My colleagues across the way keep harping on about how unions are undemocratic organizations. Once again, that is incorrect.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192667">Unions meet regularly, and all members are welcome to participate. At meetings, members are empowered to hold their leaders accountable. Discussions and debate take place during the meetings, differences of opinion are aired, and solutions are put forward. Taken together, those aspects are features of a democratic system. </ParaText><ParaText id="4192668">Unions also hold membership votes. Decisions are made by the members themselves. The members are the ones who make decisions and issue instructions. Leaders are elected by union members and can be removed from their positions. That is another key principle of a democratic system. </ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4192669">I say this with some experience. I am the product of an organized workplace. For the past 12 years, before being elected, I served as a civil servant with the Ontario public service, practising law as a crown attorney. I have first-hand knowledge of the transparency and accountability parameters by which unions abide. </ParaText><ParaText id="4192670">Yet another argument offered by the previous government in support of the old package of legislation was that it represented a modest increase in the financial disclosure obligations for unions. Again, this is incorrect. The reporting requirement in old Bill <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document> calls for at least 24 detailed statements to be submitted by unions of any size, from the smallest groups to the largest national bodies. The collection and managing of these submissions would cost the government millions of dollars, $11 million to start the oversight mechanism and $2 million every year thereafter. Those are not my figures. They come from the Canada Revenue Agency and the parliamentary budget officer. Just so we are clear, under Bills C-377 and <Document DbId="6251920" Type="4">C-525</Document>, the previous Conservative government increased the size and scope of government and government regulation, adding to the amount of red tape and, more important, adding to the amount that Canadian taxpayers would be required to shell out for such additional bureaucracy. The irony is palpable.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4192671">Argument number two is that the old legislation impeded collective bargaining. As I said at the outset, Bill <Document DbId="6251920" Type="4">C-525</Document> made it harder to certify and easier to decertify a union. With the new Bill <Document DbId="8073132" Type="3">C-4</Document>, we would repeal those provisions. Our government recognizes that certification of a union is an important part of the collective bargaining process.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192672">As I mentioned, I spent 12 years as a crown attorney specializing in the area of constitutional law. Section 2(d) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects freedom of association. That has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to include “the right to a meaningful process of collective bargaining”. Why is collective bargaining so important as to warrant constitutional protection? The Supreme Court has explained that, in paragraph 58 of a decision called MPAO. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4192673">The Supreme Court said:</ParaText><ParaText id="4192674"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> The guarantee functions to protect individuals against more powerful entities.

It protects marginalized groups and makes possible a more equal society. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4192675">Collective bargaining is important because it helps to promote fairness and equality. We get that and we are not going to waste more taxpayer dollars litigating these types of cases in the courts. On that point, I would simply note that the charter challenge launched by the Alberta Union of Public Employees against the old Bill <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document> was suspended immediately upon our government's announcement that we would be repealing the government's punitive legislation.</ParaText>

It is people like Wyatt Bilger, a hard-working carpenter and resident of my riding and a member of Carpenters Union Local 27. It is people like the countless artists, filmmakers, performers, and television producers in my riding who contribute so much culturally to our community, who are also proud members of ACTRA, the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists.

Bill <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document> was one of the four bills to get to the Senate just before the writ was issued for the last election.

Bill C-279 was going to amend the Canada Human Rights Act to include gender identity as a prohibited ground of discrimination. All parties supported and passed that private member's bill in the House in the 41st Parliament.

A good number of those recommendations and the vital updates would benefit many workers. For example, take the issues of workplace safety and preventive withdrawal for pregnant women. In Quebec, under the CSST regulations, once women are 26 weeks pregnant they are entitled to preventive withdrawal for their protection and that of their foetus. There is no such provision in the Canada Labour Code. Thus, we still have far to go. We must do more to improve working conditions for our women, our future mothers, and for all workers. Every worker deserves to be protected.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192772">Some workers have a very hard time putting food on the table every day.

This bill represents an important effort to reverse the anti-union and anti-worker legislation that was ushered through Parliament by the previous Conservative government.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192796">The NDP worked tirelessly to oppose Bill <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="6251920" Type="4">C-525</Document> at every step of the way, so it should come as no surprise that our party is in full support of repealing these bills.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192797">While I welcome the changes tabled by the government as a good first step, there is so much more to do for workers' rights and conditions. New Democrats are calling on the government to reinstate a federal minimum wage, to adopt anti-scab legislation, and to implement proactive pay equity legislation, as per the NDP motion passed in this place just a few days ago. The NDP is also calling on the government to restore good-faith bargaining with our public service workers by repealing Division 20 of Bill <Document DbId="7959017" Type="3">C-59</Document>, related to sick days.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192798">After a decade of Conservative darkness, I am encouraged to see the Liberal government taking the first steps to restore some of the rights of working people that were under attack under the previous government.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4192799">As the member of Parliament for Essex, I am determined to be a strong voice for working people both in my home riding and across Canada. The struggle of working people in Canada for unionization and their gains have benefited all Canadians. The fight of unions for a fair workplace for all workers in our country began with the fight in 1872 to have a shorter workday, but it has included changes to maternity and parental leave, the right to a safe workplace, and more.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192800">My riding has proud union members working in auto manufacturing, health care, long-term care, education, municipalities, trades, retail, and the public sector. The benefits of being a unionized worker include a legally binding contract that guarantees working conditions, job security, paid holidays, wages, benefits, health and safety, and more.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192801">On average, unionized workers earn $5 more per hour than non-unionized workers. For women, the difference is $6.65 an hour. Higher wages negotiated by unions inject an additional $786 million into the Canadian economy each week.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192802"> Unions also provide great support for communities. In my riding of Essex, unionized workers give generously and selflessly to the United Way and other non-profit organizations, which has made a vast difference in the lives of people in all of our communities, not just in the lives of union members. Gaps that exist due to government cuts and program reductions are picked up by caring union members who continue to dig deep into their pockets, even when they are suffering in their own industries.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4192803">I spent much of the last year knocking on doors and talking with people from every community in my riding of Essex. Their stories and struggles were the struggles of all hard-working Canadians: high unemployment through no fault of their own, and in our region, one of the highest unemployment rates in Canada, with many still ineligible for EI.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192804">Workers are struggling to make ends meet. Our communities are filled with the working poor, who are left no choice but to work in minimum-wage jobs and part-time or casual jobs, often piecing together two or three different jobs just to make ends meet. Sadly, this is a growing reality across Canada. Statistics tell us that 60% of all new Canadian jobs are considered precarious, part-time, temporary, contract-based, freelance, and self-employed positions. These workers are taxi drivers, contract teachers, office cleaners, and clerks. They often have no workplace pension, no job benefits, and no job security.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192805">As parliamentarians, it is our responsibility to work together and advocate for solutions that will improve the lives of all Canadians. Instead, in the previous Parliament, the Conservatives pushed through legislation, Bill <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="6251920" Type="4">C-525</Document>, designed to weaken unions and make it more difficult for Canadians in federally regulated workplaces to join a union. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4192806">These two bills moved through Parliament as private member's bills, although it was crystal clear that these were government-led initiatives. Even now, the Conservatives are threatening to use their power in the Senate to block legislation that would restore labour rights. Canadians are fed up with the unelected, unaccountable, under-investigation Senate. There is no place in our democracy for these senators to upend the work done by Canadians' representatives here in this place.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4192807">Bill <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document> was an unnecessary, discriminatory law designed to impose onerous and absurdly detailed reporting requirements on unions. Guised as a move to improve transparency, those who actually know how union locals operate also know that Bill C-377 had absolutely nothing to do with transparency. As a union member, I know the direction of the union members' funds and how they are determined, in fact, by the membership. Transparency between union members and their elected governing executives is never an issue. Members are always able to access the financial disclosure of their allocation of dues. Not a penny is spent that is not reported to the membership. </ParaText><ParaText id="4192808">Reporting requirements in Bill <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document> would bog down unions in so much red tape that it would severely interfere with their ability to serve their membership. According to the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, this bill went against the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms by violating Canadians' right to the freedom of association and privacy rights of those who work for a union.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4192809">Bill <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document> would also cost millions of dollars to implement. The parliamentary budget officer estimated it would cost more than $2.4 million allocated by the Canada Revenue Agency. In fact, it was estimated that it would cost the CRA approximately $21 million to establish the electronic database over the first two years, and approximately $2.1 million in each subsequent year. Repealing the contents of Bill C-377 would save millions of dollars for both the government and the unions, and, as I previously mentioned, would continue the critical support that unionized workers provide for their communities where government gaps exist.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192810"> Bill <Document DbId="8073132" Type="3">C-4</Document>, the government bill before us today, also seeks to repeal Bill <Document DbId="6251920" Type="4">C-525</Document>, another bill introduced by a Conservative backbencher and ushered through by a Conservative government intent on attacking the labour movement. Bill C-525 fundamentally changed the process for certifying or decertifying a union under federal jurisdiction, essentially making it harder to certify a union and easier to decertify. It should come as no surprise that workers would want to unionize. As I outlined earlier, unionized jobs tend to have higher wages, better benefits, and better working conditions than non-unionized jobs. Bill C-525 would impact all federally regulated workers seeking to certify or decertify as a union. Workers under this jurisdiction include the energy sector, airline sector, telecommunications, rail, and postal workers.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4192811"> For these federally regulated workers, to certify as a unionized workforce it was previously the case that a union was automatically certified if more than 50% of employees sign a card indicating they wish to be a member of a union. It is called the “card check system”. If between 35% and 50% of employees sign a card, a vote is triggered to ask employees if they wish to be unionized. Bill <Document DbId="6251920" Type="4">C-525</Document> changed all this by outlawing the card check model and replacing it with a two-step process. First, the card-signing process where the percentage of signed cards required to trigger a vote increased from 35% to 40%. The second step included a government supervised vote. These changes were fundamentally unfair and put workers wanting to unionize at a serious disadvantage.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192812"> Bills <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document> and <Document DbId="6251920" Type="4">C-525</Document> were not in the best interests of workers. Instead, they were designed to further attack and erode the labour movement in Canada. New Democrats will always stand for the interests of working Canadians. I am proud of how our party provided strong and effective leadership in opposing these bills in the House, at committee, and in the media. Today's legislation to repeal Bills C-377 and C-525 is a step in the right direction. I am also proud of our successful NDP motion this week calling for immediate action on pay equity. Let us also move forward on restoring and enhancing collective bargaining rights as well as fairer working conditions for all Canadians.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

							<ParaText id="4192832">It is our labour laws that help ensure there is a balance between the rights of unions and the rights of employers. However, in the previous Parliament, a number of pieces of legislation were passed that changed our labour relations system. Bills <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document> and <Document DbId="6251920" Type="4">C-525</Document>, private members' bills supported by the previous government, upset the delicate balance between unions and employers.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192833">Under Bill <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document>, labour organizations and labour trusts are required to provide the Canada Revenue Agency with details of their assets, liabilities, income and expenditures, as well as salaries paid to their officers, directors, and other specified employees. They are also required to provide information on the time spent by officers on political lobbying and non-labour relations activities. This information is then to be made publicly available on the CRA's website.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192834">This creates unnecessary red tape for unions. Under the Canada Labour Code, unions in federally regulated workplaces, as well as employers' organizations, are already required to provide their financial statements to their own members, free and on demand. It is worth noting that eight provinces have similar financial disclosure requirements.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192835">Why should unions be subject to these onerous and redundant reporting requirements, requirements that do not apply to other organizations that also benefit from similar status under the Income Tax Act, such as professional organizations?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4192836">Then there is the issue of this information being publicly available. Publishing this information on the CRA's website means that employers will have access to key union information, including how much they have set aside in a strike fund. It is not difficult to see how this puts the unions at a serious disadvantage during the collective bargaining process.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192837"> Essentially, Bill <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document> imbalances the system.

If a majority of employees signed a union card, they could go to the Canada Industrial Relations Board, show it the signed union cards, and the CIRB could certify them as the bargaining agent for those workers. If less than a majority of employees signed union cards, but at least 35% did, a certification vote could be held. The card check system worked well for many years, so why was it replaced by a system that many stakeholders, such as the Canadian Union of Public Employees, feel is less efficient and more vulnerable to employer interference?</ParaText><ParaText id="4192839">Under Bill <Document DbId="6251920" Type="4">C-525</Document>, unions are required to show at least 40% membership support before holding a secret ballot vote, making it more difficult to get the right to vote. In addition, even when the majority of workers have clearly demonstrated their support by signing union membership cards, a secret ballot vote must be held before they can be certified as a bargaining agent. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4192840">The card check system, which is based on obtaining majority support, is no less democratic than a mandatory vote system. It has also proven to be an efficient and effective way to gauge employee wishes. According to the National Union of Public and General Employees, this two-stage process essentially forces those in favour of a union to vote twice. By slowing the process, the employer has the opportunity to intimidate, harass, and unethically induce employees to vote no. Not all employers would attempt to prevent unions from organizing.

The previous government made a mistake when it brought in a private member's bill through the back door, legislation that was to make a political statement which was to the detriment of the union movement in Canada. However, it goes far beyond just the union movement, as it affects every aspect of our economy, which is something I will take a bit of time to highlight.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192856">In my former years as a member of the Manitoba Legislative Assembly, I had the opportunity to be engaged in a number of different debates regarding unions and labour legislation. In fact, in 1988, we had our most controversial days inside the Manitoba legislation, and it was surrounding labour legislation. </ParaText><ParaText id="4192857">Some might recall the use of the tool called the “final offer selection”.

When we went into committee, there was well over 100 people, from all different sectors of society, who wanted to contribute.

We also heard government members point out why those two pieces of legislation should never have seen the light of day.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192862">To give a different perspective, if the previous Conservative government truly wanted to change labour legislation of that nature, it should have brought the bills in the form of government legislation, much like we see here, with the new Prime Minister and minister responsible for the labour act. That is what should have happened, but it did not happen that way.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192863">Members asked what the result was of the bills being put forward in that sort of format. There is an obligation on ministers to consult and work with the many different stakeholder groups out there. However, the opportunity to be consulted, and for the minister at that time to conduct consultations and work with the different stakeholders, which I would suggest is their responsibility, was never done. It was never done because it was introduced through private members' legislation and there were limits.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4192864">Members will have more debate on the legislation before us than we did on one of those bills that went through second reading, third reading, and ultimately passage.

It was more concerned about scoring political points than improving harmony or consensus within Canada's labour movement, industry as a whole, and our economy.

They were doing it in an unfair fashion, and they had no qualms about doing that. </ParaText><ParaText id="4192867">I sat on the opposition bench as those votes proceeded. It was quite disappointing. We in the Liberal Party understand how important it is that we have, promote, and encourage labour harmony. That is what governments should be doing, not trying to cause divisive mechanisms or change the system to make it more lopsided. That is not what the government should be doing.

He was right. It was and is fundamentally flawed. That is why it needs to be changed. That is why the leader of the third party back then, today's<Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1"> Prime Minister</Affiliation>, made a commitment to rectify the wrong. That is what Bill <Document DbId="8073132" Type="3">C-4</Document> would do. </ParaText><ParaText id="4192870">I hear a lot about labour legislation coming from the New Democratic Party, and I would caution members. In one of the committees, the Ontario minister of labour made a presentation. She indicated that the private members' bills, if passed, would have the federal government overstepping its constitutional boundaries and stepping into an area of provincial jurisdiction. I am grateful my New Democratic friends are supporting the bill. I applaud them. However, they need to keep in mind that there is some legislation that might be better seen at the provincial level. We have to respect that jurisdictional issue, or at the very least, have that discussion with our provincial counterparts. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4192871">For example, the anti-scab legislation was talked about a lot in Manitoba during the late 70s and early 80s. It was not passed through the Manitoba legislature. Instead, the government of Howard Pawley made the decision to bring in the final offer selection, which I made reference to earlier. My understanding is that the only government that has ever brought in anti-scab legislation in a true form, from what I recall, was a Liberal administration in Quebec. It might have changed in recent years. I do not know. We see many different labour laws brought up at the provincial level. </ParaText><ParaText id="4192872">What we have today is part of an election commitment, but when there are labour changes, we need to work with the stakeholders. That is what I would like to recommend when people look at this, especially the Conservatives.

It reduced opportunities to influence politicians with contributions by banning contributions from unions and corporations, and it levelled the playing field among individual contributors.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192906">We also introduced Bill <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="6251920" Type="4">C-525</Document>, which made unions more transparent and accountable to both unions and Canadians. The specific intent of these bills was to preserve the democratic rights of Canadian workers and increase public confidence that unions spend their money wisely and effectively. With the passage of this legislation, the public was empowered to gauge the effectiveness, financial integrity, and health of their labour unions.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4192907">Some opponents today described Bill <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document> as anti-union. They said that union money should not be scrutinized by Canadians, let alone by their own union members. This is simply not true. These unions are subsidized by the Canadian taxpayer, and they are subsidized by a very significant amount. The federal government offers generous tax benefits to workers' organizations and a tax exemption on profits earned on investments, income from employers, and the profits generated by training centres. Despite receiving these substantial tax benefits, these organizations in the past were not required to disclose publicly how they used these tax advantages. </ParaText><ParaText id="4192908">To put this in the same context, for the federal government, including me, and I am sure all of my colleagues in this room, every dime we spend is open to the public. It is on my website. People can check it out right now. Provinces, municipalities, and charities are asked to make these types of financial records public. The only ones who are not are unions. </ParaText><ParaText id="4192909">It is frustrating that unions that should be accountable to their members and that receive generous tax breaks with taxpayer dollars do not feel that they should have the same obligation to disclose their finances to the public. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="15">(1415)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4192910">In most cases the money is deducted from the payroll whether the employee wishes to be part of that union or not. The money is then subject to tax exemptions that keep $500 million out of the Canadian treasury each year.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192911">I think, and it is obvious from the polls we have done, that most Canadians believe these dollars and what is being done with them should be made public. Bill <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document> is about that disclosure, and it was a positive step forward for unions and Canadian workers. It ensured that union members and Canadians could have access to the knowledge on how union money was being spent, how their membership dues were being spent, as well as the investment in taxes and dollars that resulted from these dues.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192912">Bill <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document> simply imposed transparency and accountability on unions, nothing more. It required labour organizations to file public information a return with the Canadian Revenue Agency on an annual basis. We heard that today. They said that they were doing that in seven provinces. All of a sudden they are saying that now that we are asking them to do it across the country, it is some sort of unbearable burden. If they are already doing it in many cases, it is not that hard to make a second copy and give it to the CRA.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4192913">The disclosure requirements would include financial statements, including the amount paid for political and lobbying activities, and the salaries paid to executive and staff. Nothing more.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192914"> In addition, the bill requires the CRA to display this information on a website for the public to see. Far from targeting unions, Bill <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document> does nothing more than impose the same obligations that registered charities across Canada now face. I am a Rotarian and I have been one for many years. We do our financial audits. We do our year-end audits and ensure it is available for the public to see. We certainly do not consider that to be some incredible burden.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192915">If charities across Canada can somehow manage to do this, unions that receive a half a billion dollars a year through taxpayer subsidies can manage to do this as well. Their members want them to do these things.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192916">If the <Affiliation DbId="214313" Type="4">Minister of Employment</Affiliation> believes that transparency and accountability is so devastating to Canadian unions, why do so many other countries have similar legislation, and their unions have thrived? The United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, even France, socialist France, asked their unions to have similar legislation and to put their financial documents forward to the public. Even some Canadian labour organizations already do this. If their head office is in the United States, they have to make their financials public as well.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4192917">Some people have said that this creates an unfair burden on unions. This type of legislation has been in the United States for decades and has not impacted their collective bargaining in any way. The fact is that this bill does not regulate the activities of trade unions, how they participate in collective bargaining or in any way how they spend their funds.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192918">The bill does not violate their Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It has stood up to constitutional challenge. For example, former Supreme Court of Canada Justice Michel Bastarache released his opinion on Bill <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document>, and said that it was constitutional and would be upheld in the court he sat on. This shows, a former Supreme Court justice has said that these pieces of legislation that we put forward are not unconstitutional.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192919">The bills simply provide greater transparency and accountability, ironically, two things the Liberal government campaigned on but do not seem too eager to follow up on.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192920">As I touched on earlier, a survey conducted by the Leger firm in 2013 showed that of the 1,400 Canadians it polled, 83% said they wanted to see this type of legislation to be adopted by unions, and 84% of current union members also agreed. A Nanos poll done in 2011 showed similar results. Therefore, this has not changed. For some reason, the Liberal Party wants us to think that between 2013 and 2016 there has been an incredible earthquake of change in position of union members.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4192921">When the <Affiliation DbId="214313" Type="4">Minister of Employment</Affiliation> brought forward <Document DbId="8073132" Type="3">C-4</Document>, did she actually consult with union members before she brought this forward? If 84% of union members in 2013 supported the type of legislation that we put forward with Bill <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="6251920" Type="4">C-525</Document>, what has changed in three years? What has changed in three years that now the Liberal government believes the union membership has been crying for it to repeal this type of legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192922">I am certain there has been an outcry, but my bet is it is from the union leadership, not the union members who the Liberals failed to consult before bringing this forward.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192923">Earlier this week I asked the Minister of Employment if she had actually consulted with union members before bringing this type of legislation forward. Her answer was a no answer. She could not answer. I think the fact is that the Liberals did not. What she said was that she had spoken to 22,000 residents in her constituency during the election campaign.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="20">(1420)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4192924">I would like to ask her this. Did she say to them that her bill would be in favour of less democracy? Did she ask them if they were okay with the government's stomping on the very foundation of our democracy and getting rid of secret ballots? Does she think her Manitoba riding spoke for the rest of Canada? I would be interested in seeing what her answer is on something like that.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192925">It is in the public interest that the financial information of workers' organizations be disclosed because of the tax breaks they receive. It is a benefit of the union workers because they exercise their democratic right through a secret ballot. It is also the benefit of a government to consult with Canadians, as we did when we drafted this type of legislation. For example, Dan Kelly, president and CEO of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said he supported Bill <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document>. He said that almost all unionized workplaces are forced to pay union dues. Therefore, unions should be required to publicly disclose how they use those funds. He also stated that public financial disclosure for unions would enhance transparency and accountability with regard to trade union activities. He was not the only one. We had lawyers, union members, and professors all come and speak to the committee and Senate committee in support of this legislation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4192926">Canadian labour laws are in place to protect the rights of workers, to ensure that they have a fair and productive workplace and can work in an environment where they feel they can speak with their conscience. This is about balance and it creates a fair environment in which workers are the ones making the choice so they feel it is better suited to their needs. It is a Liberal government that is attempting to repeal legislation that created accountability, transparency, and fairness for workers. The Liberals plan to go back to a system that was broken and balanced unfairly. This is not what Canadians want.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4192927">The Liberal <Affiliation DbId="214313" Type="4">Minister of Employment</Affiliation> said that the government was repealing Bill <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="6251920" Type="4">C-525</Document> in favour of creating a balanced network. This is exactly what our previous legislation did. The main principle of that legislation was that all federally regulated workers should have the democratic right to a free and fair secret ballot, especially when they are voting to certify or decertify their union. The legislation recognized the right to peaceful association is one that extends to all workers in Canada, should they wish to have a union represent them or not. The choice is theirs to make, and it should be theirs to make by way of a secret ballot. The choice should not belong to their union leadership. The system was open to abuse, where co-workers could be coerced or intimidated into voting for a union. It is not unreasonable, nor should it be unreasonable, to ask to have a secret ballot. It is consistent with every democratic system we have in this country. It is a basic right afforded to all voters, and should be reasonably extended to workers who are voicing their opinion on whether they want to be in a union. The only way to achieve this is through a secret ballot.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4192928">It seems that the Liberals' goal and mandate here is to change every voting system that we have across this country. It is absolutely clear that the Liberal government has no respect for Canadians' right to vote. They want to get rid of the secret ballot here in the House. They want unions to go back to the card check system. They also do not believe that Canadians have the right to vote in a referendum when we are talking about possibly changing the very system of how we select our government. Piece by piece, the current Liberal government is intent on dismantling our democracy.</ParaText><ParaText id="4192929">During the spring of last year, I had an opportunity to meet with representatives of a union at a gas plant in southern Alberta. It had about 80 members. I wanted to ask them how they felt about the legislation we had put forward. They were honest. They said they were being pressured by their union leadership in eastern Canada to vote against the Conservatives because of Bill <Document DbId="6251818" Type="4">C-377</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="6251920" Type="4">C-525</Document>. I asked them whom they supported and how they were going to vote. They said they were voting Conservative and supported the bills and information contained therein, that they wanted to see the financial records of their union leadership and to have the freedom of conscience to be able to vote in a secret ballot.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4192930">Right now, as we put forward Bill <Document DbId="8073132" Type="3">C-4</Document>, I want the <Affiliation DbId="214313" Type="4">Minister of Employment</Affiliation> to come forward and be honest with Canadians. The reason she is putting forward Bill C-4 is that it is a way to repay the union leadership who helped get her elected. It is not a bill that is in the best interests of Canadians.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
