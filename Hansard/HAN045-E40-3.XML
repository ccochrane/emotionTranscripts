							<ParaText id="1951213">Mr. Speaker, the low-income rate among Canada’s seniors has declined dramatically, from 21.4 percent in 1980 to 4.8 percent in 2007.  The current rate is now one of the lowest among countries in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.  Together with other elements of the retirement income system, public pensions have contributed to this positive outcome.  </ParaText><ParaText id="1951214">The old age security, OAS, program provides a critical role in enabling low-income seniors to maintain a minimum standard of living in retirement.  The program provides a basic monthly pension to 4.5 million seniors aged 65 and over and additional monthly income through the guaranteed income supplement, GIS, to 1.6 million seniors who have little or no income other than their basic OAS pension.  </ParaText><ParaText id="1951215">The vast majority of GIS recipients have incomes above Statistics Canada’s after-tax low income cut-off, LICO.  Out of 1.6 million GIS recipients in 2007, less than 170,000, or 10% of all GIS recipients, were below the after-tax LICO.  

</ParaText><ParaText id="1951216">In order to bring the maximum level of OAS/GIS benefits in par with the LICO, the GIS would have to be increased by about $360 per month for single seniors.  This would cost approximately $4.5 billion per year, as all single seniors, about 1 million, would benefit from the increase, not just those below the LICO.  

</ParaText><ParaText id="1951217">GIS recipients have benefited from recent measures targeted to seniors most in need.  These include, but are not limited to: a 7% increase to the GIS benefit, over and above indexation, since 2006; an increase to the GIS earnings exemption from $500 to $3,500 in July 2008.  This means that low-income seniors who wish to work can retain more of their GIS benefits; and the creation of the tax-free savings account, TFSA, to increase tax-efficient savings opportunities for Canadians.  TSFA investment and withdrawals do not affect GIS benefits, which is an important feature for low-income seniors.  </ParaText><ParaText id="1951218">As the Government addresses the income needs of seniors through public pensions, it also recognizes the importance of early planning by individuals and families.  To help Canadians better understand and manage their finances, including planning and saving effectively for their own retirement, the Government launched Canada's Task Force on Financial Literacy to provide recommendations on a cohesive national strategy on financial literacy.  The independent task force is undergoing cross-country consultations this spring and is expected to report back to the Minister of Finance by the end of the year.</ParaText></ResponseContent>

							<ParaText id="1951221">Mr. Speaker, the incidence of gang members resorting to the wearing of body armour or the fortification of their vehicles raises a number of challenges for law enforcement and legislators alike.  A number of provinces have taken steps to address this conduct through provincially enacted legislation.  Regulatory responses, which can include enforcement provisions, provide an appropriate way to limit such practices.  The Government of Canada will continue to work closely with all its partners, including the provinces and territories to improve collective responses to organized crime.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951222">For its part, the Government of Canada has recently taken steps to strengthen the Criminal Code’s response to organized crime.  Bill C-14, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (organized crime and protection of justice system participants) came into force on October 2, 2009 and, amongst other things, provides tailored responses to murders connected to organized crime and “drive-by” shootings.   For more information on these new laws, please see: http://canada.justice.gc.ca/eng/news-nouv/nr-cp/2009/doc_32430.html.

The member for <Affiliation DbId="128596" Type="2">Algoma—Manitoulin—Kapuskasing</Affiliation> was right to say that the bill needs to be studied in detail.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951315">I, too, am worried that the oil industry has been asked to police itself. Oil companies are being asked to evaluate how well they respect the laws. That is incredible. They are both judge and judged. The Bloc Québécois has the solution and it is Bill <Document DbId="4328407" Type="4">C-452</Document>, which will be debated a little later today.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951316">Bill <Document DbId="4420060" Type="3">C-14</Document> is also of direct interest to me. I often travel back and forth between Ottawa and my riding of Vaudreuil-Soulanges. Obviously, I have to take my car. Every time I stop to fill it up at a gas station, I cannot help but wonder why prices vary so much from region to region. In the same city or an area of a few kilometres, the prices may be the same or they may differ, oddly enough, by a number of cents a litre. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951317">I often wonder if the prices at the pump are accurate. Those are a few reasons why I am interested in today's debate. I think that Bill C-14 is a good start, and because of that, I agree with it in principle. It would amend the Electricity and Gas Inspection Act and the Weights and Measures Act. However, the bill does not directly address collusion problems amongst oil companies, nor does it effectively prevent sudden gas price increases. I still believe that we need to continue our efforts in this area and encourage the members to pass Bill <Document DbId="4328407" Type="4">C-452</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951318">In order to better understand the Bloc Québécois' position, it is important to understand what this bill is proposing. As its title indicates, the bill would make two amendments to two different acts. It would amend the Electricity and Gas Inspection Act by providing for higher maximum fines for offences, as well as punishing repeat offenders. It would also amend the Weights and Measures Act to require that retailers cause any device that they use in trade or have in their possession to be examined within a prescribed period. Non-compliance could result in penalties.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951319">Bill <Document DbId="4420060" Type="3">C-14</Document> introduces fines for violations of the Electricity and Gas Inspection Act. An inspector who noticed a violation would be able to impose a penalty on the offender. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951320">In addition, a person who wanted to contest a fine would have to prove that he had exercised due diligence to prevent the commission of the violation. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951321">Another interesting point is that the penalties can be cumulative. A violation that continues for more than one day is considered a separate violation for every day during which it continues. This measure is more stringent, because it requires offenders to act quickly and make the necessary changes to comply with the act.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951322">Still in the section on amendments to the Electricity and Gas Inspection Act, Bill C-14 would allow the <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> to make public the names and address of persons who had violated the act. The advantage of releasing this sort of information is that people could avoid offending retailers.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951323">We noted that a violation under the act would not constitute a Criminal Code offence, which means that an individual found guilty under Bill C-14 would not have a criminal record. This should be examined in more detail in committee.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951324">Bill C-14 also amends the Weights and Measures Act. One of these amendments would allow inspectors to enter a retailer's premises. A government-appointed inspector who had reasonable grounds to believe that a violation had been committed could examine and seize any document that could prove that there was a violation. Under this provision, the inspector could even limit access to the premises and require that the retailer stop operating faulty equipment.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951325">Bill C-14 provides for large increases in the penalties under the Weights and Measures Act. A person found guilty under the act would not be fined $1,000, as now, but up to $10,000, in addition to being liable to imprisonment of not more than six months for a first offence. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="50">(1550)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1951326">In the case of a first offence prosecuted by indictment, the fine is increased to $25,000 and can be accompanied by a maximum prison sentence of two years. In the case of a re-offence, the bill increases the maximum fine to $20,000 and if a repeat offender is tried for another conviction on indictment, the fine can go up to $50,000 with a maximum prison sentence of two years.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951327">I am very anxious to hear the minister's arguments on this once public servants are invited to appear before the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology to justify these sentences and elaborate on the problems at the pumps.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951328">Much like the amendments to the Electricity and Gas Inspection Act, the proposed changes to the Weights and Measures Act will allow for cumulative sentences to be imposed for each of the days the offender is found to be in violation. The bill introduces stricter penalties and allows for cumulative sentences. Repeat offenders will be punished. That is basically what the bill aims to do.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951329">The Bloc Québécois has several concerns. When the Conservative government prorogued Parliament in December 2009, the Bloc Québécois began a pre-budget tour. I met with many citizens and various associations from Vaudreuil-Soulanges to find out what they wanted and what they expected from the budget. These meetings confirmed that the public's main concerns are the environment and the economy. The Bloc Québécois' positions are explained in the document <I>Saisir l'occasion pour le Québec</I>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951330">As I said in my speech, the Bloc Québécois supports Bill <Document DbId="4420060" Type="3">C-14</Document> in principle, but Bill <Document DbId="4328407" Type="4">C-452</Document> is also a direct response to the problems related to competition. My colleagues, the hon. members for <Affiliation DbId="128305" Type="2">Shefford</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="128363" Type="2">Chicoutimi—Le Fjord</Affiliation>, will discuss that a little later today.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951331">The Bloc Québécois' Bill C-452 addresses the flaws in Bill C-14. At the risk of repeating myself, we have some concerns about Bill C-14, but since we are a responsible serious party, we are suggesting solutions.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951332">In response to Bill C-14 and the shortcomings of the measures put in place by the January 2009 budget implementation bill, we have introduced Bill C-452, which would give real powers to the Competition Bureau. The Bureau could act on its own and initiate inquiries, without waiting for permission from the minister or for a complaint to be filed. If the Bureau had reasonable doubts, it could investigate.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951333">Bill C-452 would strengthen the Competition Bureau and would better protect the public against the actions of some businesses, which might take advantage of their position to unfairly fleece and gouge consumers.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951334">We have other possible solutions. My Bloc Québécois colleagues and I strongly believe that we must adopt a comprehensive strategy to combat the rising cost of petroleum products. There are three criteria needed to apply this comprehensive strategy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951335">The first criterion to make our comprehensive strategy a success is that we must continue to support initiatives that help us decrease our dependence on oil. The rising cost of oil is making Quebec poorer. Increased prices affect the economy in many other ways. Increased exports of Alberta oil tend to increase the value of the Canadian dollar. Our manufacturing companies are the ones who suffer.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951336">The Bloc Québécois has three ideas to decrease our dependence on oil, and my colleagues can read about them in detail on the Bloc Québécois site, because the document is public.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951337">We must increase the budget of the ecoEnergy for renewable heat program, and expand its scope to solar thermal power, to include forest biomass.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="55">(1555)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1951338">We need a program to support the use of forestry byproducts in energy and ethanol production. We have to stimulate new product research and development. We can do this by offering refundable tax credits for research and development so that companies can benefit even if they are at the development stage and are not yet making a profit.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951339">There are many other suggestions and ways to reduce our dependence on oil. We just have to be bold and focus on the importance of acting now to help the environment. We need to think about what consumers, what our fellow citizens, what Quebeckers are really paying for when they use oil products.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951340">Bill <Document DbId="4328407" Type="4">C-452</Document> meets one of those criteria. Its goal is to discipline the oil industry. As parliamentarians, we have to show people that we are ready to protect their interests.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951341">I encourage members to discipline the industry by voting for Bill <Document DbId="4328407" Type="4">C-452</Document> because it gives more powers to the Competition Bureau. The government should commit to setting up a petroleum monitoring agency. It is time for oil companies to respect people. They have to be accountable.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951342">The final criterion is to make the oil industry contribute. The price of oil is going up, which results in higher prices for transportation and many consumer goods. Because of this, the oil industry is raking in huge profits. The very least these companies can do is pay their fair share of taxes.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951343">As part of our comprehensive strategy to address the rising cost of oil products, we want the government to eliminate tax breaks. In 2003, the government cut oil companies' taxes from 28% to 21%. In 2007, the Conservative government proposed another tax cut, and according to the 2007 economic update, oil companies will be taxed 15% in 2012. Why should such a rich sector of the economy benefit from so many tax breaks?</ParaText><ParaText id="1951344">The oil industry needs to be part of the solution. The $3.6 billion pocketed by oil companies is not available to the public. That money could be reinvested in society.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951345">Our comprehensive strategy to address rising oil costs is reasonable and feasible. There are only three ways to change the way we deal with oil. We have to reduce our dependence on oil, make the oil industry pay its share by eliminating tax breaks, and discipline the oil industry with Bill <Document DbId="4328407" Type="4">C-452</Document>.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951346">I will give the House a short overview. In May 2003, before the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, the commissioner of competition pointed out that the Competition Bureau did not have the authority to initiate an inquiry.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951347">Since 2003, subsequent governments have not taken action. The government never takes action when the price of gas fluctuates. It believes its inertia is justified by the fact that the Competition Bureau is not able to prove that there are agreements among oil companies to fix the price of gas. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951348"><B>An hon. member:</B> Well, that is obvious.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951349"><B>Ms. Meili Faille:</B> How can investigative powers be given to an institution when it must bow to the will of the minister or when this institution is only able to take action after receiving a complaint?</ParaText><ParaText id="1951350">The Bloc Québécois wonders why it takes a complaint and a request by the minister to set the wheels in motion. If the Competition Bureau has information pointing to collusion, it should be able to initiate an inquiry immediately.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951351">Still in 2003, the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology concluded its study on fluctuating gasoline prices with some recommendations. The first was to create a petroleum monitoring agency. The second was to toughen up the Competition Act. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951352">According to the committee, this agency would have been able to clear up confusion among the general public regarding the price of gas by providing existing data to the public. The agency would have overseen all aspects of this activity.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951353">That same year, the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology spelled out the changes it wanted to see made to the Competition Act.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="00">(1600)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1951354">Obviously the Bloc Québécois agrees with this recommendation and it pushed for the government to respect the work of the committee and agree to implement this monitoring body, something it did not do. In response to the committee, the government of the day said it did not feel it was necessary to create this monitoring agency and it argued for the status quo.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951355">In 2005, the Liberal Party of Canada had proposed, through Bill <Document DbId="1436284" Type="3">C-19</Document>, amendments to the Competition Act allowing for measures to mitigate rising gas prices. Note that, once again, the government did not incorporate the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Industry, Natural Resources, Science and Technology into its Bill C-19. The committee had recommended reversing the burden of proof to address agreements between competitors and to make it possible for the Competition Tribunal to award damages to parties affected by restrictive trade practices, where applicable. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951356">The purpose of the first recommendation was to make it the responsibility of the parties wishing to enter into an agreement between competitors to prove the ultimate social value of that agreement. The second recommendation of the Standing Committee on Industry, Natural Resources, Science and Technology would have made the pendulum swing back the other way since measures restricting the business practices of the guilty parties could have been imposed.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951357">You can guess what happened. Bill <Document DbId="1436284" Type="3">C-19</Document> died on the order paper since it was introduced just before the election. That is why, in 2007, the Bloc Québécois introduced Bill <Document DbId="2999117" Type="4">C-454</Document>. That bill made it to second reading stage, but another election saw the Bloc Québécois bill scrapped. In 2009, a little more recently, the Bloc Québécois noted that the Conservative government had adopted part of Bill C-454. Nonetheless, the government does not think it is necessary for the Competition Bureau to initiate its own investigations.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951358">It is clear that in 2010 nothing much has changed. The flow of information has not improved much and there is no agency governing the attitude of the oil companies, quite the contrary.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951359">The government must deal with problems of fairness swiftly and I want to know what it is waiting for to take action.

I want to offer up my comments as a theme to the consumers of our country, the hard-working men and women who each day use vehicles to get to work, to take their children and their families around communities and to survive. Perhaps more than the people in the House, the issues of price of gasoline and the fairness of those prices and the lack of competition in prices of gasoline and fuel products are very important to them.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951386">I also want to offer up my comments as a theme to the small independent retail service station owners like Lyle Hogan on St. George Street in Moncton, New Brunswick, and I will get back to that.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951387">First is the issue of the framework of the bill. Bill <Document DbId="4420060" Type="3">C-14</Document> is the government's highly publicized fairness at the pumps act. The legislation attempts to address tampering at the pumps and has been presented as the great hope that consumers have been waiting for across the whole stretch of issues that I mentioned. However, we have to analyze the bill to see if those expectations and hopes are met.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951388">The <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> introduced the bill last month with much fanfare. He aimed to provide court imposed fines under the Electricity and Gas Inspection Act and the Weights and Measures Act. The bill would see higher fines for offences committed under either of these acts. As well, regular inspection and enforcement have also been heralded by the government as key elements in the proposed legislation.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="1951389">The House should certainly support measures to protect the public against unfair retail practices, because confidence in the accuracy of measured goods and services is essential to a vital, efficient Canadian economy.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="1951390">First, as I have briefly covered, the fairness at the pumps act would see increased fines and administrative penalties for inaccurate measurements. I do not think anybody can argue with that.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951391">Court-imposed fines under the two acts that I mentioned would rise from $1,000 to $10,000 for minor offences and from $5,000 to $25,000 for major offences. Again, I do not think anybody quarrels with that fine imposition. It marks a change in time that these are serious offences under regulatory schemes that should be addressed. The act also addresses the need to deter repeat offences of inaccurate measurement, such that the ultimate fine is $50,000 for repeat offences. That is significant.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951392">The act would further allow for new administrative monetary penalties to allow for graduated enforcement reflective of the severity of the various offences. With fines for minor offences and prosecution for serious and repeat offences, Canadians can be assured of appropriate and effective regulation and enforcement at the pumps.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="20">(1620)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="1951393">Similarly, the use of prosecution would mean that offenders would not face tough penalties and a criminal record for minor violations, but for more serious offences.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="1951394">The second item of interest in the proposed act is the much discussed introduction of mandatory and regular inspection of retail devices. This kind of accountability has no doubt been long overdue and it is high time Canadians see this sort of retailer responsibility.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951395">Measuring device accuracy would be carried out through increased and regular inspection. At present, the bill proposes to phase in measuring of devices in the sectors of retail petroleum, wholesale petroleum, dairy, retail food, fishing, logging, grain and field crops and mining. Needless to say, the bill would seek to bring accountability to a number of economic sectors.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="1951396">I fully support this amendment, because regular mandatory inspections are the norm in the G8 countries, in industrialized nations like France and Germany and nearly everywhere in the United States.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951397">Canadians want this, even though it is a bit late in coming, because they expect to get what they pay for. With regular pump inspections, Canadians will get the goods and services they are entitled to.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951398">I should point out that the recommended frequency of mandatory inspections is the result of consultations held across the country.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="1951399">Finally, the other significant aspect of the proposed legislation would be the use of private sector service providers. The bill would provide the minister with the authority to appoint inspectors from outside the government under the Weights and Measures Act. Government has stated that this privatization of inspections would allow for Measurement Canada to “leverage its resources fully” and “enforce its mandate”. If the bill goes to committee, clearly at that stage these claims must be examined in detail.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951400">The government would see Measurement Canada inspectors responsible only for enforcement actions. Meanwhile, independent inspectors or authorized service providers, as the government likes to call them, would be conducting the proposed increase in inspections.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951401">I think consumers might want to be aware of the word accountability. Effective responses to complaints must be ensured as Canadians deserve this. However, ensuring these mandatory and frequent inspections are conducted with appropriate follow-ups may not necessarily be best accomplished through out-sourcing. This is but another example of matters that must be fully explored in detail in committee.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="1951402">If the government is to provide independent inspection services, how much will that cost Canadian taxpayers? Bill <Document DbId="4420060" Type="3">C-14</Document> may lead to more competitive inspection services, but that has not yet been proven.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951403">Under this bill, the number of inspections will rise from 8,000 to 65,000 a year. Naturally, this increase will come at a cost, and the House has a duty to see that the services cost Canadians as little as possible.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951404">The provision of the bill on independent inspectors includes small businesses that could take on this role. We have to be sure that we understand the full impact of this provision before we pass this bill.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="1951405">When I first read the bill and examined the outsourcing of inspections, I could not help but think about the first experience I had on Parliament Hill as an elected person. That was not as a member of Parliament, but as a mayor of a city. I was brought up here to be a witness, under my own steam, I might add, in case there is some inquietude about that, to give evidence with respect to water quality and water management in the country as a result of what happened in Walkerton in 2000. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951406">Members of the House will remember with regret that neither of the two men working for the Utilities Commission in the Walkerton incident had any formal training whatsoever. The tragic results of water contamination in Walkerton will not be forgotten and should teach us all a lesson about accountable and effective inspections, no matter what the industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951407">I am reminded of why engineers have a steel ring on their little finger when they graduate. It is to remind them that the construction of items under their control are very important because it was linked of course to that very famous bridge collapse, which was an engineering failure.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951408">Every time that we outsource a government service, we should be very mindful that the service serves the public and serves a very good purpose, which, we should all remember, in the Walkerton incident did not work.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951409">The first thing we should note today in examining the preliminary evidence before it goes to committee is that industry analyst Michael Ervin made some comments about the proposed legislation. What he said, which was illuminatory to me, was that we are debating what really is, in effect, the Weights and Measures Act anyway. As he put it:</ParaText><ParaText id="1951410"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">--there are laws and regulations around the metering of gasoline through pumps already. And to my mind they are more than adequate.</QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText><ParaText id="1951411">The act in question requires that consumers get fair and accurate value for whatever they buy, and that measuring equipment must be held to certain standards. While the government may want to assure consumers that they are being burned by the retail gasoline industry, the effectiveness of the measures in this bill must be examined. If customers are being charged an additional $1.50 to $2 each time they fill up, they have every right to be upset. That is very unacceptable, of course. I have no doubt that in this House there is agreement that hard-working Canadians deserve that protection.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951412">The <I>Ottawa Citizen</I> did a study in 2008 that revealed that of more than 200,000 government inspections in less than a decade, 6% of the pumps were inaccurate. In fact, 2% of the time, the pumps erred in favour of the consumer and 94% of inspections revealed consumers were getting what they paid for.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951413"> I likened it a little bit to my job in the House as vice-chair of the justice committee. We hear that there are vast and grave problems with the administration of justice in our community. We are beset with a new law every day, but in many cases the evidence shows that the real solution to many of the crime issues is to put in the resources with police, put in the resources with corrections officials, and I do not want to stray too far from the topic, but it is somewhat the case here. Yes, there is a problem in 4% of the cases, but is that enough to herald this as the panacea to all problems with respect to gas prices at the pumps?</ParaText><ParaText id="1951414">Retailers evidently want a fair and level playing field with regulations that apply to all. Moreover, fair treatment of the consumer must be a priority and the amendments to regulations must be based, however, on solid evidence. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951415">A constituent of mine, a small, independent retailer whom they call the little man, is Lyle Hogan. He is the guy who runs the station that still fills up the gas with an attendant. My 81-year-old mother searches all around town to find a gas station like that because she never quite figured out how to use those automated systems. Lyle Hogan has expressed to me some very real concerns about the laws that are applicable across this country. He told me how alarmed he was at the increased cost this legislation would visit on the independents in addition to what already occurs. His quote was, “Annual inspection is $2,000 for calibration and I am completely unaware of faulty equipment amongst others in this area”.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951416">Mr. Hogan's worry is probably well founded because he is an honest, hard-working guy, out for the little man. It might even make it harder for the independents, who never make a lot of money in this industry, where the real problem is the concentration of ownership and the lack of competition in gas pricing in this country.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1951417">Lyle Hogan represents the hard-working Canadians whose livelihoods depend upon the retail gasoline industry. It does not matter what riding they are from. We all know them, and we also know, like the drug stores and millinery shops on Main Streets across this country, that they are a fading entity. They are the little guys. They are the Alan Jackson song, <I>The Little Man</I>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951418">We should be concentrating on the bigger issue. I hope that the debate that takes place at committee will follow a lot of the advice and information that we have received from the gas guru, my friend from <Affiliation DbId="128252" Type="2">Pickering—Scarborough East</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951419">Hearsay of gross inaccuracy at the pumps in a malicious business practice about Lyle Hogan is not going to solve the issue. What is going to solve the issue about what affects Canadians is this. How often do we say the Americans are ahead of us with respect to retail price protection? They are. With respect to the <I>Weekly Petroleum Status Reports</I>, which come out of the energy information administration in the United States of America, they can give people like my friend from <Affiliation DbId="128252" Type="2">Pickering—Scarborough East</Affiliation> the information that he needs to become the gas guru and know about the lack of competition, the wholesale industry of prices, and the substantial overvaluation of energy markets that occurs right now. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951420">In other words, there is enough crude oil in the world. There is a supply in stock and it does not reflect the prices at the pumps. The prices at the pumps in this country are artificially high and the margin for retail operators such as Lyle Hogan might be 3¢, 4¢ or 5¢. He does not have a lot to play with.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951421">When we talk about the retail industry, there have been mergers, acquisitions and closures to the point where in any town or city across this country, there are perhaps more gas stations, or bigger ones, but fewer owners and operators, brands, distinctions and diversification.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951422">How is it that we can say there is probably a problem with information? We can say it because in the United States the service is there. The Americans know exactly what crude stocks there are, what prices ought to be, and what investors, through their Wall Street machinations, are doing to control upwards the price of retail gas.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951423">Then we ask ourselves, why does any member of Parliament have to resort to an American publication and link it to Canadian stocks and the Canadian situation? The reason is because there was an idea floated around in 2005 of having a petroleum price information service for Canada, the same thing available in the United States. It has not been acted upon by the government. In fact, every inquiry to give it life has been quashed, and energy consumers, people knowledgeable in the industry, are left to use American information.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951424">We have a situation where we do not really know what is going on in the Canadian industry. We can surmise from world crude prices. We have a concentration of ownership that is affecting the consumer dilatoriously.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951425"> Luckily enough, in my own province of New Brunswick, the provincial government saw fit to institute a regulator scheme. I am not saying it gives the right lower price that consumers deserve, because that is a Canadian issue, but it does give some regulation and some consistency over a period of time to prices, which at least allows people not to be shocked by price changes and not be subject to those long line-ups that we see in other provinces when it is announced that prices are going up or down, depending upon the market whims.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951426">We are in May of 2010 now and the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I>'s investigation came to light in May of 2008 with respect to pump accuracy. If Canadians had been gouged at the pumps, as the government maintained years ago, why did it not act on it sooner? I could say one word “prorogation”. That is something that we ought to bring up in this House. We ought to say that we have not been here as much as we would like to in order to speak to bills like this because the government keeps pulling the plug on legislation. It keeps pulling the plug on the democratic process and this minor fix to the bigger situation was delayed because of that.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1951427">More important, the bigger fix to the bigger issue, which is to look at the issue of concentration of ownership, the lack of information from a government agency, has been delayed even further because we have not been sitting enough. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his press gang are so busy having drive-by press conferences that they do not want to really get down to the issue of prices at the pumps for Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951428">In closing, this is a bit of a smokescreen. The bill should definitely go to committee. However, at committee, I am hoping the members of that committee discuss the real issue, which is why consumers, hard-working Canadian men and women, who have to drive their kids to school, who have to take them to minor hockey, who have to get to work, are paying too much at the pumps and why people like Lyle Hogan, who has a one-man operation, may be out of business because we have not, at this time, in this place, addressed the real issue of who is being gouged and who is doing the gouging.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951429">I urge the government to get on this issue for the good of all Canadians.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It is very important. It goes along the theme of measuring and being honest to consumers, which is what this bill is all about.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951455">Frankly, if this bill had been proposed as a minor and positive change, that would be fine, but I fear that sometimes in this game that we play we leave people with the impression that we have fixed the issue of gouging at the pumps. For most people, the issue of gouging at the pumps is the high price they pay. It is not the 3% of the time that they pay $1 extra. It is the higher taxes at the pump that the Conservative government said that it would address. The Conservatives ran on the platform that they would address excise tax. They had an opportunity to do that but they did not. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951456">The other issue that they need to address concerns the ownership concentration of the few setting the price for the many. There has been no action on that from the government. It does not seem to care about talking to big business about how to help little business. </ParaText>

This is an attempt at a smokescreen by the government to try to appear tough on the oil and gas industry, in particular to the retailers in this instance, who are not the culprits at the end of the day in terms of high pricing. That comes from other parts of the industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951460">It is important to note that we will not be supporting this to go to second reading because this is really about de-regulation, less accountability and would cause greater problems for the Canadian public as opposed to fixing the current system under Measurement Canada, and penalties that could be done as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951461">My colleague who spoke before me was speaking out about the upcoming Memorial Cup. I can say that the Spitfires will be returning as champions. We will continue that debate another time. However, I wanted too ensure that he did not have the last word, as he thought. He was wrong on that and he is wrong on his predictions as well.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951462">This particular bill comes about in a very interesting way. It was actually a number of years ago that there was a challenge to the industry through Measurement Canada. That information was gathered a number of years ago and did not go public. A freedom of information request by the press broke the information and the story opened. It then led to some interesting discussions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951463">I would remind the House that on May 12, 2008, my leader, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128276" Type="2">Toronto—Danforth</Affiliation>, asked the then minister of industry at that time, who has since been punted to another department, about this issue and whether or not the government would do anything on it. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951464">In the response to my leader, the minister at the time said: </ParaText><ParaText id="1951465"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Second, I have instructed regulatory changes to be prepared. These will increase the onus on gas retailers. Fines will be increased from $1,000 per occurrence to $10,000 per occurrence. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1951466">Meanwhile, it took approximately two years for this to happen, and it was under another minister.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951467">The government was very clear about trying to distance itself from this issue by not acting on it. It is rather perplexing because what it has offered are some modest changes in terms of accountability. I do want to run through some aspects of this bill, which is very important, and some of the background to it. I will also tackle some of the deficiencies of the bill and why it is just a smokescreen for an attempt to appear accountable to Canadians about this industry when the government really is not.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951468">As I mentioned, a media story appeared in the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I> after an investigation was done by Measurement Canada which found that 5% of the 200,000 fuel pumps that it investigated between 1999 and 2007 delivered less fuel than reported on the pump display. The government inspection data showed that about one-third of Canada's gas stations, about 14,000, had at least one faulty pump.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951469">We had a chronic situation with regard to that and it was uniform. There was a big story in my paper in Windsor West because we had some of the worst pumps in my riding. What that means is that people are not only getting ripped off by what they are paying at that time to the company, but they are also paying tax on phantom gasoline.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951470">Despite having put this bill forward and despite having that information over all that time, the government did not use any of the available tools to either do one of two things: to fine the companies for doing that, which it could have been doing; or attempting to restore, from its own coffers, the theft from Canadians when it actually took taxes on phantom gasoline.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951471">That is important because it just shows the lack of respect in terms of fixing the problem. We do not have a study that goes for nearly a decade which finds a significant problem across the board and then wait for a couple of years to introduce legislation. Ironically, this legislation would lead to the industry self-policing itself. Basically, it would be a wink-wink, nod-nod approach to accountability that would allow the industry to actually grow itself.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1951472">I will get into it later, but the inspectors who would be part of this process would likely come from those very companies. They would be creatures of the companies. As the testing, the equipment, the measurement and all those things are very specialized, it would be very difficult for independent companies to get into the market.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951473">Measurement Canada would end up going to the administration of fines and penalties as a sole responsibility. It will probably be a lot less busy because it will probably get a lot less evidence about the actual situation. I have no confidence whatsoever that consumers would benefit from the particular changes outlined in this bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951474">I mentioned that the bill is about other issues and I want to read them off. This is about measuring devices for a series of things: retail petroleum, downstream or wholesale petroleum, dairy, retail food, fishing, logging, grain and field crops, and mining. We are going to have deregulation in all of those elements as well. We do not accept that as a process to move forward.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951475">I would point out that this industry has already gotten off enough with lack of regulation by not having the significant strength of a competition bureau. It does has some tools to it. In fact, a find was levied on a company just a little while ago today. It can happen but they are still not sufficient in terms of having an ombudsman office or the accountability monitoring that has been recommended since 2003.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951476">I know the member for <Affiliation DbId="128252" Type="2">Pickering—Scarborough East</Affiliation>, who has done terrific work on this file, will remember the days of coming here in the summer to have hearings and have the industry basically rule the roost and once again put this issue on the back burner. Unfortunately, we still have not seen accountability, although that member has done terrific work on this file.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951477">I want to follow up now with the issues related to this that would change. It is important to notice in legislation that we can refer this to committee, and that is sometimes a reasonable approach to take. For ourselves, however, we will not do that because we do not want to see the use of private sector authorized service providers being activated by this legislation at the end of the day. The risk is far too great. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951478">We have habitually seen abuse from this industry upon nations and upon customers, which is one of the reasons that we have to get off our dependency on oil and find other alternatives. We just have to look at the Gulf of Mexico right now where once again the industry was able to get its way. For those who say that it did not, that it is nonsense, because we all saw the political campaigns of the United States that said, “Drill, baby, drill”.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951479">That has all evaporated right now but what has not evaporated is the hundreds of thousands of gallons of crude that is threatening the ecosystems that affect not only the United States but also Canada. We have asked questions about that and the Conservative members have heckled us saying that we are in Canada and not in the United States. However, those ecosystems are shared by a number of different species that have a connection to Canada. We also know that some of that oil can eventually reach into some of the international streams and eventually, if it is not plugged, reach into our own system here</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951480">This is a very serious issue and deregulation and letting industry self-police has led to that problem over there. When the “drill, baby, drill” campaigns were going on during the presidential election, the end result was that even the Obama administration loosened up standards to allow for more offshore drilling. The Americans have now put a moratorium on that, but there was enough of a penetration to open that up.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951481">On the Canadian side, we have seen a whole debate over a number of years about the taxation policy of this issue. The taxation policy of this issue in this chamber has happened for many years and that is because there is basically a breakdown of our taxes into three taxes: the crude oil cost in terms of the price at the pump; the gross profit margins for retailers and refiners, which is around 16% to 18% for marketing; and taxation at 38%. Canada's taxation on this comes from royalty taxes, excise taxes and sales taxes.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951482">I do not want this debate to be forgotten in terms of what members have previously said here when they talked about the cost and the price at the pump. I think the minister pointed to the cameras and warned the retailers that they were coming after them for the amount of money that they might have been scamming from not having the proper pumps fixed right, either knowingly or unknowingly.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="55">(1655)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1951483">There have often been government and opposition members talking about the cost of this to Canadians, that it is really important for our lifestyle, important for our environment and important too for how we use our natural resources. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951484">I want to read a quote from the House of Commons on May 12, 2004:</ParaText><ParaText id="1951485"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister will know that across the country Canadians are struggling with record gas prices. Canadian businesses are being hurt. Canadian consumers are burdened with the difficulties this is causing, but the government itself is rolling in record gas tax revenue. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1951486"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentRest="1" IndentFirst="2">Will the Prime Minister finally do the right thing and agree to lower gas taxes for Canadians?</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1951487">The member who said that was the current <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. It was the current Prime Minister who was advocating for the reduction of taxes on gasoline, something that the government really has not done.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951488">When they tried to do that by removing the GST, there was no accountability in that for the system. What we have seen is the coffers of the nation suffer with the reduction of gasoline taxes at the pump from the GST without the savings being measured and paid back to consumers.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951489">That is a real problem because the companies are getting record profits, record tax cuts and also extra revenue now from the taxation policies that were never followed up with proper accountability. That is because we do not have an ombudsman office. We do not have a system in place that ensures the policies are going to be fulfilled by the actual objectives and that was unacceptable.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951490">I will read another quote:</ParaText><ParaText id="1951491"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...when all is said and done, the government seems content with high gas prices. The reason is the government does not want to reduce gas taxes, so it actually wants high gas prices.... </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1951492"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentRest="1" IndentFirst="2">Will the government admit that the real reason it does not want to do anything is that $1.40 is its actual target price for gasoline?</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1951493">That was the current <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who was once again advocating for a policy that he has never put in place, and that is the policy of reducing gas prices for Canadians.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951494">We never saw any of that with regard to this announcement. We did not hear the <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> say the government was going to ensure that any of these savings are going to be passed on. In fact, the creation of this system and this regime that is being proposed could actually increase the cost of gasoline for the retailers and subsequently for Canadians. There is going to be an increase in inspections, which I argue is good in a sense, but at the same time those costs are going to be borne by the retailer, and the retailer will pass those on. The margin of profit for the retailers is very small, especially for an independent operation. They do not have the same luxuries as some of the larger ones. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951495">When we go to our gas station, it is almost like a drug store these days. They sell chocolate bars, pop, chips, coffee, and they partner with different organizations to run small businesses out of their stations. They have a whole series of different products and services, because gasoline has such a small margin of profit that they end up having to rely on other measures.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951496">When this issue is going to be passed on to the inspectors, when they have to pay the fees for it, it will be interesting. They will be able to set their own prices for this. They will be able to keep a system in place that will be very difficult to challenge. As I mentioned earlier, the industry will have a key advantage. Who has the training, who has the equipment, who has the knowledge, who has the skill set to be able to do the type of testing that is necessary and make a business out of it?</ParaText><ParaText id="1951497">They will have behind them a wealth of backing in terms of loans as well as operating costs that will give them a strategic advantage over any independent business or organization that may want to bring about accountability by being independent and doing that measuring outside the realm of the industry itself.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951498">I suspect it will be a subsidiary, or it could be a spin-off, or it could end up being relied upon to get training, equipment and a series of things that will create a dependency model. We will not see the type of innovation that we will need on this issue.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951499">We will see a continuation of deregulation. We will see the industry police itself and it is an industry, once again, that has shown no support whatsoever to being more competitive. That is critical. When we look at supply and demand we know that right now we have a record high supply of a number of different gasoline and fuel products, yet pricing still remains above a certain level. That is unacceptable.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1951500">We also do not necessarily have to have collusion in this industry, because there is a lack of competition with the vertical integration that has taken place. I would look to the issue, for example, of the Burlington refinery station that was shut down by Petro-Canada. Instead of investing in that facility and ensuring more competition for refining, it mothballed it and shut it down and then bought Esso gasoline to put in Ontario Petro-Canada sites. So there is no competition with regard to the product and the actual use of it on the open market. It is important because it does affect daily lives for a number of people. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951501">We have everything from low income people who are very significantly affected by gasoline prices to truckers, in particular, who are dependent upon this. We have been talking about this issue since 2002-03 when it went to committee. Many truckers have moved into more independent operations and are getting squeezed right now. There is also the rural element where they have to traverse over a greater distance and have no choice but to use private transportation to ensure getting to a destination to be able to work or whatever it may be. They also have stronger winter conditions, using more fuel for a series of things.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951502">When we look at this act being supposedly more accountability for consumers at the gas pump, in Ontario they will wake up on July 1. I do not know why the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and Mr. McGuinty cannot leave Canada Day alone when bringing in a new tax. This is Mr. McGuinty's second taxation date on Canada Day. First it was for health care and now it is for this. Maybe we need an act of Parliament to stop taxation from starting on Canada Day. But when the HST comes into effect in Ontario, there is going to be a windfall for the McGuinty provincial government. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951503">I had parliamentary research do some work for me. For those out there, parliamentary research is available for all members of the House. It is a very important part of our democracy. It allows economists, lawyers and other types of researchers to do independent work for members who may want to share it later on, but it is independent from an MP's office, other members and the government, and it is critical.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951504">I asked for a breakdown on the HST in a responsible way. Researchers looked at 13 major cities across Ontario and the average price of gasoline over a number of years, I believe five years. Under the regime right now, they expect the provincial government to bring in an additional $1.2 billion in gasoline tax, and another $500 million is going to come in, so $1.7 billion in total, just for gasoline and diesel for the province of Ontario next year. That is if the price remains just under $1 a litre.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951505">This windfall the provincial government is stepping into is available only because the Conservative government has agreed with the harmonized sales tax, and we can quote the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> talking about policies on this and wanting to bring it to other provinces. Ironically, we are borrowing $4 billion to bring this into Ontario. So we are borrowing money, we are going to pay interest on that money as we are in a deficit right now and we are then going to ask Ontarians to pay an additional $1.7 billion more in taxation at the pump this summer.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951506">In conclusion, we need to have real accountability. We do not need deregulation in this industry. We need to make sure it is going to be held accountable. Every time anything is brought up, the government claims foul, that there are no issues, but I can say there is an issue and it is that Canadians have been getting hosed at the pumps not only by the retailers having poor equipment but also by the government's not living up to what it said when it was in opposition and introducing policies that increase taxation on people.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

In the days of the NEB there was a made at home Canadian price. Now we are subject to international prices and it has become alarming not just with what happened last Friday, with a 1,000 point decline in the stock market, but the hon. member will probably know better what has happened with Goldman Sachs, its commodities and the fact that there has been a significant involvement of swap dealers, hedge traders, funds.</ParaText>

Because the Enron loophole has not been closed and we have subjected ourselves to international pricing, consumers in his riding and mine are now being badly affected, to the tune of not 1% of 1 in 25 pumps but, in fact, 30% to 40% of the actual cost of fuel regardless of where one is in the country.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It makes little sense for us to continue to fight over these tiny scraps like the 5% of pumps.

But some pumps have shown far larger failures. Last year, a pump at a station near Chatham, Ont., was caught shortchanging consumers by 1.5 litres on a 50-litre tank, which is common to most average size cars. Drivers who visited one pump on Corner Brook, N.L., would have had to buy an extra two litres to top up their tanks.

A majority of MPs voted in support of the New Democrat motion.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951569">On May 8, 2009, the Conservatives introduced their own credit card reform, which turned out to be little more than an information campaign to better show Canadians just how they are getting gouged. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951570">On June 30, 2009, the Senate committee report recommended that consumers have their pockets picked even further.

I am continuing to hear mainly from small businesses in my riding that they have no guarantee when somebody pays with a credit card that they are not going to pay some outrageous sum as a credit card transaction fee.

Many, many seniors in this country are on fixed incomes. Many seniors in this country had investments or perhaps they were lucky enough to have a pension plan. However, there are seniors who have been collecting their pensions from companies that they thought would be in business forever and they are watching those companies go bankrupt.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951578">I was at a heartbreaking meeting a number of weeks ago.

They had worked their entire life for that company and they are wondering if they will have enough pension left. One man said to me, “I am 70 years old.

The price at the pump skyrocketed for all consumers and businesses. Companies raised their prices to compensate for the cost of fuel, and that pushed prices on consumer goods through the roof. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951590">Bank losses combined with rising prices on consumer goods triggered an economic crisis. That is why the parliamentary committee needs to study the possibility of giving the Competition Bureau more powers.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951591">The parliamentary committee will have to look at the price of crude oil, the refining margin, taxes and the retail margin.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951592">The retail margin is the difference between the price retailers pay for gas and the price they sell it for.

Most of these taxes are set and do not vary. Taxes are not the cause of increased gas prices; oil companies are.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951594">To lower refining costs, oil companies have shut down a number of refineries and increased production capacity. The gap between supply and demand has narrowed, and so the slightest weather-related or technical problem leads to a price increase to maintain the balance between those two factors. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951595"> Long weekends and vacations are not unforeseen events.

They have nothing in reserve, and they tell us that the price increase is due to scarcity.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951596"> Can we imagine a small businessperson failing to keep any inventory in the lead-up to Christmas, and then claiming scarcity to raise prices?

For example, the refining margin increased slightly in January and February 2009. Since this happened in the middle of winter during a global recession, the traditional short-term or even long-term factors do not seem to apply. Winter is typically when the refining margin is at its lowest.</ParaText>

The three largest refiner-marketers have 76% of the market share. The five largest account for 90% of the market. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951605">The Competition Act must have teeth. Measures have been proposed to discipline the industry, and that includes strengthening the Competition Act. At present, the Competition Act has shortcomings. The Competition Bureau cannot conduct an investigation on its own initiative. It can only respond to complaints or a request from Industry Canada.

The American oil industry, which has been on the defensive since the report was released, acknowledges that inventory is low, but claims that there is no collusion—which would be a crime—between refiners to keep inventory low. According to the industry, there are two reasons for the low inventory: the decline in the number of refineries and the growing demand for petroleum products in the 1990s.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951622"> The subcommittee noted that mergers in the oil industry and the closing of many refineries over the past 20 years have increased the concentration in the refining industry. It also noted that during this period, the margin between supply and demand became tight. The subcommittee stated that higher retail prices, for example, in California, were the result of having a highly concentrated market.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951623">The subcommittee did not discover any evidence of collusion among the oil companies to reduce supply in order to drive up prices. However, Senator Levin pointed out that the industry was so concentrated that collusion was not necessary to artificially impact supply. That is why it is important that the House of Commons examine this issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951624">However, we have other options available to us, such as creating a petroleum monitoring agency. In its November 2003 report on the price of gas, the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology proposed the creation of a petroleum monitoring agency. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951625">It is quite incredible that, while the oil industry supported this initiative, the Conservatives were against it. The Conservatives are even more inflexible than the oil companies when it comes to defending the interests of the oil companies. They really do not need lobbyists, when they have the Conservative government. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951626">To make it look as if it was doing something, the government set up an Internet site that gave the price of gasoline in major cities. It was just an Internet site. It did not conduct any studies on the oil industry and was unable to recommend any course of action. In other words, it achieved nothing. It takes a real office to monitor this industry. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951627">We have to redistribute resources in order to stop the oil industry from making our society poor. We have to impose a $500 million surcharge on the oil companies' profits. We have to repeal the accelerated capital cost allowance for investments in the oil sands, when the price of crude exceeds a threshold of somewhere between $40 and $50. The government announced this measure in its last budget, but it will not come into effect for another three years. We have to make the oil companies pay for the environmental damage they cause by establishing emissions caps, together with a carbon tax and a permit trading system. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951628">On December 9, 2009, I invited some officials from the Competition Bureau to my Ottawa office to explain to them that Bill <Document DbId="4328407" Type="4">C-452</Document> would give them more investigative powers but, to my surprise, they told me that they did not want more powers.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951629">This is why I think it essential that this bill be carefully examined in parliamentary committee, and I hope my colleagues will allow that to happen.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The Government of Canada has recognized that fact by taking significant steps over the past two years to modernize Canada's competition regime and to align it more closely with the competition laws of our country's major trading partners.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951648">It is important to ensure that consumers and legitimate businesses do not fall prey to illegal activity and that if they do they have the confidence that the law will be enforced effectively and that penalties are tough enough to deter future illegal activity.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951649">Important amendments to the Competition Act became law on March 13, 2009. The amendments will help to further increase the predictability, efficiency and effectiveness of the enforcement and administration of the act for businesses and for the Competition Bureau. In turn, this will better protect all Canadians from the harm caused by anti-competitive conduct. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951650">These amendments came about through key recommendations made by the Competition Policy Review Panel which was formed in July 2007 with a mandate to review Canada's competition and foreign investment policies and to provide recommendations to the federal government on how to make Canada more globally competitive.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951651">The panel spent a year reviewing Canada's competition and investment policies. Its report, “Compete to Win”, concluded that in order to prosper, Canada must adopt a more globally competitive mindset. The report concluded that intensifying competition will build a stronger economy, better products at lower prices, more jobs and higher earnings, stronger firms and greater prosperity.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951652">The recommendations made by the panel formed a key part of Canada's economic action plan and provided the basis for the amendments to the Competition Act that were introduced in budget 2009 and passed as part of Bill C-10.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951653">The main elements of the amendments were as follows: creating a more effective mechanism for the criminal prosecution of the most egregious forms of cartel agreements between or among competitors and introducing a non-criminal review process for other forms of competitor collaborations; allowing the Competition Tribunal to award administrative monetary penalties against companies that have abused a dominant position in the marketplace; introducing a two-stage merger review process to allow for a more efficient and effective review of proposed merger transactions; increasing penalties for deceptive marketing practices; expressly empowering the courts to award restitution to victims of false or misleading representations; and finally, repealing criminal sanctions for certain pricing practices to ensure that creative pro-competitive initiatives are encouraged.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951654">These amendments ensure that we have the tools to better protect consumers and businesses from the most flagrant types of anti-competitive conduct, while being ever mindful of the importance of not discouraging pro-competitive behaviour in the market.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951655">I raise the government's actions in this regard because of their importance with regard to the issue we are considering today. As I have described, as part of the amendments resulting from the passage of Bill C-10, new criminal cartel and civil agreements provisions came into force on March 12, 2010. These provisions were delayed for one year to give companies an opportunity to verify that their existing or proposed agreements and arrangements did not violate the new civil and criminal provisions. During this time, companies were able to apply to the bureau at no cost for an advisory opinion as to how the bureau would view a pre-existing agreement under the new provisions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951656">Under the previous cartel provisions of the act, it was extremely difficult to secure a conviction. The Crown needed to prove that an anti-competitive agreement resulted in substantial harm to competition and to prove that element to the criminal standard of beyond a reason doubt.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951657">These hurdles faced by the bureau were out of step with our major trading partners and harmed Canada's international credibility. The provision had not changed significantly in almost 120 years. The Competition Policy Review Panel recommended that this outdated law be changed and this government acted.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951658">We introduced a two-track approach to address agreements among competitors so that the bureau can crack down on harmful conspiracies and pro-competitive agreements and joint ventures can proceed expeditiously.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951659">Price-fixing is a criminal activity that deprives Canadians of the benefits of a competitive market, such as lower prices and choice. The new cartel provision will provide the commissioner with even stronger tools to challenge this type of anti-competitive practice.</ParaText>

Importantly, the commissioner investigates the behaviour of businesses and individuals where there is evidence that they may have broken Canada's competition laws.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951663">It is clear that the issues the House must consider when debating this bill are far-reaching and very complex.

As the legislation currently dictates, the Commissioner of Competition is responsible for administering and enforcing the Competition Act.

This should include the authority to independently initiate an inquiry into an entire industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951673">Currently, the Competition Bureau must receive instructions from the minister or conduct an inquiry in response to a complaint filed by a company, consumer or legal entity.

Support for this bill would ensure that the Competition Bureau is provided with the necessary authority to take action against companies or individuals that attempt to take advantage of Canadian consumers.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951675">The bill would strengthen the Competition Act, giving the government the right to initiate investigations when there are sufficient grounds to investigate possible collusion, price-fixing or anti-competitive behaviour in an entire industry sector.</ParaText>

As we all know, and as my colleague from the Bloc pointed out, there have been allegations as well as proven cases of price-fixing at the pumps. This unjust manipulation takes advantage of consumers and threatens healthy competition.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951679">Having spoken of one industry, this is not the only industry that this bill addresses. This bill is focused on any industry as a whole that provides a service or a product to the consumer. The current government promised to remedy this issue but we have not yet seen anything of substance presented by the government. It appears as though the Canadian government has largely forgotten about Canadians' concerns over gas pricing. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951680">With the support of my colleagues, Bill <Document DbId="4328407" Type="4">C-452</Document> would empower the Commissioner of Competition to initiate investigations that relate to this debacle and take action to ensure that these types of schemes do have consequences.</ParaText>

The New Democratic Party will be supporting this initiative. The member should be commended for bringing this issue forward. There are those who argue that the Competition Bureau does have sufficient powers right now and does not need additional resources, but I am of a different opinion. There are a number of different products and services out there with which I will deal. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951685">I think competition is not entirely happening the way that it should. It should be noted that the debate that will continue at committee will be very important as part of a process to review a series of sectors and I hope we can get experts and witnesses to come forward.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951686">The sponsor of the bill made reference to the oil and gas industry in the previous debate on a government bill and mentioned the lack of competition in the oil and gas sector. There is almost a collusive element. I noted in particular the Petro-Canada situation where instead of investing in Petro-Canada refineries in Burlington, it shut down the plant and now imports gasoline from Esso and sells it in Petro-Canada stations across Ontario. So there does not necessarily have to be price fixing, but there will not be very much in variables involved with regard to trying to move into a more competitive situation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951687">It has always been the case, as we look at the oil and gas sector, where there is a lack of refinery capacity, vertical integration with the industry, a series of different elements that lead to basically a formula that is a recipe for disaster for Canadians and their pocketbooks. It was interesting when the government lowered the GST with regard to oil and gas, and the cost that the companies now actually get back, it was not passed on to the consumers. The prices and profits have risen significantly and not even one single organization or company took advantage of the opportunity of the 2¢ reduction to pass it on to consumers. They took it and put in their own pockets.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951688">Because the government had no accountability whatsoever in terms of monitoring the process, or no interest whatsoever, we have lost hundreds of millions of dollars out of the coffers of this country every single year that could have gone to different things whether it be health care, or whether it be more money to the Competition Bureau to be able to examine anti-competitive practices. A whole series of things that could have been addressed are now gone, and the companies now have record profits and record tax cuts from the government which are windfalls they have enjoyed.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951689">It is only fair that we actually examine the bill and look at the oil and gas sector as one of the variables in how it can be addressed because the bill is specifically geared to the industry sector which is a responsible way to approach it. It allows targeting to certain areas where there is a lot of interest. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951690">We are seeing that now at committee where there are a couple of current issues that are very important. We have the entrance of new players into the Canadian market with regard to telecom and that means more communication devices, cellphones, BlackBerrys and wireless service provisions that are being expanded in Canada. There are those who feel there is no competition in that sector and relatively similar price elements make it very difficult for consumers to get a better benefit. They have also been receiving record profits and are quite lucrative. Almost all the groups and organizations of the big telecommunication companies have done well.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951691">There are three new entrants coming into the market, so there is no question that this is timely to look at whether or not the Competition Bureau is going to be sufficient to have the independence to examine cases, have the resources to do so, and have the tools to be able to make decisions that are going to increase the competitive nature of businesses in Canada, those that are regulated and those that are non-regulated.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951692">Another issue raised often with regard to this issue is credit cards. New Democrats have been calling for a number of credit card reforms. My good colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128626" Type="2">Sudbury</Affiliation> has been pushing this issue and the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> is basically moving for a voluntary agreement. It is clear that we have deficient credit card competition in Canada. There are some groups and organizations that are more progressive, but at the same time it is seen basically as a system that is stuck where the vast majority of credit cards have interest rates that are quite similar.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1951693">Once again, that is an area where we want to see more healthy competition, but we have not. The banks are also making record profits and we have seen the same things there. My office receives complaints with regard to how close bank fees are among different organizations.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951694">There does not actually have to be a collusion, where there are brown envelopes changing hands and information being wired back and forth to predetermine the actual cost of items and passing them on to the consumer. There just has to be basically a general acknowledgement that they are going to stay in a certain field of play and compete in that field of play. That is not real competition.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951695">For a few years, we used to carry out inquiries into the insurance industry as well and about the issues there. We just have to talk to people about auto insurance and a series of things, and they often find that there is not enough healthy competition or they cannot get certain services whatsoever. I know that some people are outright denied or have to pay really high fees. There are maybe only one or two companies that will provide that demographic, so the fees are through the roof with regard to costs and they really do not get into a competitive market because certain groups of people are written off altogether by these companies. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951696">The Competition Bureau would be well-equipped to look into that because if people cannot even get quotes on insurance, they are stuck with very few recourses of action. We can just talk to young people about what they are paying for auto insurance. They in particular are scammed because I have not seen the evidence that warrants that type of behaviour.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951697">The other issue I have been working on regarding competition is the issue with Toyota. Toyota is a company that is under criminal investigation in Japan, the United States and Europe. Yet here, the government has not even done anything, aside from having two meetings at the transport committee, which we forced the government to do.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951698">The issue behind that is not just in regard to the safety of the vehicles. It is also an issue of competition. Did Toyota know about problems with its vehicles and choose not to fix them, to gain market share at the expense of other manufacturers? It does not matter if one makes a curling iron or a car, if one knows that the device has a problem and chooses to neglect and not fix that to gain market share, it becomes a competition issue because it runs other companies under.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951699">I am very proud of negotiating a change in public policy here, with the Liberals at that time, a number of years ago. It used to be law in Canada that if a business was given an environmental fine or penalty, it could claim that as a business tax deduction. I viewed that as an environmental issue, health and public safety issue, but also a competition issue, and here is why.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951700">We had a drug company, for example, which had a $10 million fine. To explain this clearly, this company was charged with something. It went to court. It was fined $14 million and at tax time, it actually got $10 million back as a business-related expense. If a company polluted the lakes, oceans and streams, and it got caught and was fined, whether it be millions of dollars or hundreds of thousands of dollars, it could claim it as a business tax deduction and get money back on that.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951701">What was important about this change, and why I am proud of negotiating the end to it, was that the good companies were getting punished just as much as any others. They were following the law and doing the right things and they had to compete against those that were actually abusing people and the environment, and that is not right.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951702">I welcome the member's bill here today and look forward to having the discussion at committee. I think it will be a helpful discussion at a very important time, when many products and services need to be looked at under a competitive regime.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We also hope that some parts of this legislation will find their way into government bill <Document DbId="4420060" Type="3">C-14</Document> on electricity and gas inspection and on the Weights and Measures Act.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951704">I had an opportunity earlier this week to speak on Bill C-14, and it is good that we are now going to discuss Bill C-452, which is still necessary in our view. We need to continue our efforts to deal effectively with the problem posed by the Competition Act, which still does not allow the Competition Bureau to conduct inquiries on its own initiative. It is still necessary, unfortunately, to wait for a complaint from some individual before an inquiry can be initiated.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951705"> Even though the Bloc Québécois supports Bill C-14 in principle, it is not an end in itself. With the introduction of Bill C-452, the Bloc Québécois reiterates its intention of freeing Quebec from its dependence on oil through a bold program focused on green energy and the electric car. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951706"> To do this, Bill C-452 expands on the measures the government is introducing in Bill C-14 by proposing further steps that could be taken to protect consumers. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951707"> Our bill would give the Competition Bureau the power to conduct on its own initiative real inquiries into an industry if there are reasonable grounds for doing so. At present, this is not permitted. The Bureau has to wait for complaints or for instructions from the minister before it can act.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951708"> Even though the government says it took action to correct the situation in the Budget Implementation Act of January 2009, there are no provisions in this act allowing the Competition Bureau to make inquiries on its own initiative. A complaint is still needed before an inquiry can be launched.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951709"> It is obvious that a bill like this would leave the Competition Bureau much better equipped to fight companies that want to take advantage of their dominant position in the market to fleece consumers. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951710"> The Bloc Québécois is not inventing anything new here. We have simply repeated for several years now the recommendations in the report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, which was tabled in November 2003. The federal government has never done anything to help consumers in this regard. It has a fine opportunity here, though, to set up a monitoring system for the petroleum industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951711"> To understand the steps leading to the debate on Bill <Document DbId="4328407" Type="4">C-452</Document>, we need to go into the history of it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951712"> In 2003, the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology tabled a study on the price of gasoline that made two recommendations to the government: create a petroleum monitoring agency and tighten up the Competition Act. The committee even specified the changes to the Competition Act that it would like to see. At the time, the Bloc was already saying that the government should implement the committee’s recommendations. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951713"> In October 2005, the Liberal government came around to the Bloc’s arguments and, as part of its plan to help curb the increase in the price of gas, it tabled amendments to the Competition Act in Bill <Document DbId="1436284" Type="3">C-19</Document>.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1951714"> Unfortunately, Bill <Document DbId="4463679" Type="3">C-19</Document> was just an election gimmick to give the impression the government was doing something to discipline the oil industry and it died on the order paper.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951715"> The Conservatives are quite enamoured of the oil industry, of course, and it is hardly surprising that they did not re-introduce the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951716"> As a result, in 2007 the Bloc Québécois tabled Bill <Document DbId="4328429" Type="4">C-454</Document>, which passed second reading on April 28, 2008. But it too died on the order paper when an election was called in 2008.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951717"> In 2009, the Conservative government partly revived Bill <Document DbId="4328429" Type="4">C-454</Document> in the Budget Implementation Act of January 27, 2009, although the Competition Bureau still was not allowed to launch inquiries on its initiative.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951718"> So here we are seven years later debating Bill <Document DbId="4328407" Type="4">C-452</Document> to give the Competition Bureau some real teeth.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951719"> There is no doubt, in the Bloc’s view, that the Competition Bureau should have greater freedom of action and more discretionary power over its inquiries. To conduct an inquiry, the Competition Bureau needs access to all the documents so that it can do a good job of investigating and promoting competition.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951720"> The Bloc Québécois has long been pressing the government to take action in view of the rising price of petroleum products. Bill <Document DbId="4328407" Type="4">C-452</Document> is just a first step toward countering the increase in the price of gas. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951721"> Apart from Bill <Document DbId="4328407" Type="4">C-452</Document>, the Bloc is more convinced than ever that the industry should do its fair share.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951722"> As I said at the beginning of my speech, Bill <Document DbId="4328407" Type="4">C-452</Document> is part of a plan for sweeping change.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951723"> First, we must put a stop to the tax cuts for oil companies. In 2007 or just one year after taking power, the Conservative government gave the oil companies another tax cut in the 2007 economic update. As a result, the companies will see their tax rate fall to 15% in 2012. In that year alone, this tax break will help them pocket nearly $3.6 billion.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951724"> We also need to reduce our dependence on oil. Quebec does not produce any oil and every drop that Quebeckers consume impoverishes Quebec, in addition to contributing to global warming. The Bloc Québécois therefore wants to reduce our dependence on oil.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951725">In 2009 alone, Quebec imported $9 billion worth of oil, less than usual because of the recession, but in 2008, oil imports totalled $17 billion. Over a period of five years, from 2003 to 2008, oil imports increased by $11 billion.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="20">(1820)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1951726">Furthermore, to reduce our dependence on oil, the Bloc has proposed substantial investments in alternative energies to create a green energy fund, launch a real initiative to reduce our consumption of oil for transportation, heating and industry, including an incentive to convert oil heating systems, and introduce a plan for electric cars. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951727">We have to get ready, because by 2012, 11 auto manufacturers plan to introduce some 30 fully electric and hybrid models.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951728">The objectives of Bill <Document DbId="4328407" Type="4">C-452</Document> are clear. A bold program focused on green energies and electric cars that will allow Quebec to end its dependence on oil is urgently needed.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951729">Until we can put an end to this dependence on oil, we must give more power to the Competition Bureau by allowing it to initiate inquiries, and by creating a petroleum monitoring agency.</ParaText>

Our government is committed to identifying and removing unnecessary job-killing regulation and barriers to growth. This government stands for free and open markets. Open and competitive markets are the best way to promote new dynamic, innovative products and ideas.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951735">Having set out this broader perspective on the government's priorities, allow me now to the turn to the details of the bill.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951736">On its face, the bill appears to be quite straightforward. It proposes a single amendment to the Competition Act. If adopted, it would provide the Commissioner of Competition with additional power to commence a formal inquiry under the act.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951737">To be clear, the act already allows the commissioner to start a formal inquiry into the conduct of a company, or companies, whenever she has reasonable grounds to believe that the act has, in some way, been violated. The amendment being proposed now would add to that authority. It would allow the commissioner to start an inquiry into an entire industry sector at large.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951738">There is an important distinction between what exists today and what is being proposed.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951739">Under Bill <Document DbId="4328407" Type="4">C-452</Document>, there would be no requirement to show any evidence that the enforcement provisions of the act might, in some way, have been contravened.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951740">It is important to understand the consequences of such a change. The commencement of a formal inquiry is a serious step in the investigative process. Once at the stage of inquiry, the commissioner is able to apply to the courts for permission to use the investigative powers of the Competition Act to subpoena oral and written evidence from any party who may have relevant information regarding the matter under investigation. This is reasonable power for the commissioner when she is examining business practices that she has a basis for believing violate the enforcement sections of the act.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951741">The commissioner must have access to modern and sophisticated investment tools to allow her to determine, in an unbiased fashion, whether the law has been violated.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951742">At the same time, this is an authority that imposes both considerable and complicated obligations for those under investigation and significant public and private costs to ensure the obligations are met. Failure to comply raises the risk of being found in contempt and the possibility of fines and imprisonment.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951743">The position of the Commissioner of Competition demands the exercise of prudence and good judgment. I have every confidence that the Commissioner of Competition does, and will continue to, exercise her authorities with the utmost care and responsibility. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951744">However, the Office of the Commissioner requires direction. The introduction of this type of power proposed by the bill would put at risk the reputation of the commissioner and the staff she directs. The authority to inquire into an entire industry sector without any evidence of wrongdoing would open the commissioner to criticism that she is engaging in a costly fishing expedition.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951745">We must also remember that the commencement of a formal inquiry and the commissioner's use of her formal powers come at a cost to her office. Her primary responsibilities are the enforcement provisions of the Competition Act. Any inquiry into an entire industry sector would demand extensive use of limited bureau resources. Without additional funding, the commissioner would need to reallocate assets from her other priorities.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951746">It is imperative that Parliament consider the burdens we would impose on the commissioner when we amend the legislation and establish her enforcement priorities, and the cost to Canadian businesses and consumers if we distract from that principled focus.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951747">As I noted at the outset of my comments, this government is committed to improving job opportunities for Canadians and growing our economy. We are committed to finding and eliminating unnecessary job-killing regulation and barriers to growth. We are not here to introduce measures that would result in new barriers to growth and prosperity.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951748">As we consider this bill, we must also remember the steps that this government and this Parliament have already taken to address the issues that lie at the heart of this bill.</ParaText>

Gail Shea (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1951759">Madam Chair, I stand today to talk about the importance of the shellfish industries on our east coast and to discuss some of the challenges we face in these important fisheries. My hope is this evening's take note debate can be a valuable and constructive discussion of those serious issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951760"> I can tell hon. members that I have a very deep understanding of the importance of these fisheries to our communities, because my own hometown, like many others, relies heavily on shellfish. For better or for worse, I am never very far from talk about shellfish. I have also devoted a great deal of my time as <Affiliation DbId="128709" Type="4">fisheries minister </Affiliation> to working on many levels to address some of the difficulties facing these vital industries. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951761">To first put this in perspective, shellfish fisheries make up 85% of the total value of all landings in Atlantic Canada. In 2009 this represented $1.4 billion flowing into communities across five provinces, providing thousands of employment opportunities in fishing and processing sectors. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951762">The largest of the shellfish fisheries is of course lobster. There are 41 lobster fishing areas on the east coast and most of the harvest occurs close to shore, usually within 15 kilometres. There is also an offshore fishery that harvests in the deep basins and outer banks off southwestern Nova Scotia, about 90 kilometres from shore. The harvesting sector is made up of approximately 10,000 licensed harvesters, with each participant restricted to fishing in a specific lobster fishing area, which is generally next to the participant's home port. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951763">The lobster fishery has one of the longest histories of fisheries regulations in Canada. Many of the management measures in place today date back over a century. The inshore lobster fishery is managed by effort control. This means limits are set on the number of licences, length of fishing seasons and number of fishing days and traps. Conservation measures involving minimum size limits and the production of egg-bearing females are used. Lobster fishing seasons are designated for each area and they are staggered to protect summer moults. Output control, such as total allowable catch, is used for the offshore fishery. This fishery is open year round and its total allowable catch has remained unchanged since it was established.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951764">Lobster is Canada's most valuable seafood export and our primary export market is the United States. However, more than 59 countries from all corners of the globe enjoy lobster harvested in Canadian waters. Given the industry is highly reliant on foreign markets, it was greatly affected by last year's global economic downturn. I am proud to say that our government was there to help our lobster fishermen during these difficult times. We invested $10 million last year in marketing support for the industry, $8.5 million in short-term support and an additional $50 million in long-term support, designed to restructure the fishery for future sustainability.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951765">The second most valuable shellfish is crab, specifically snow crab. Canada is the world's largest producer of snow crab, accounting for about two-thirds of the global supply. In 2009 almost 80% of all snow crab exports from Canada went to the United States. China and Japan are also major markets.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951766">There are 32 crab fishing areas in Canada spanning four geographic regions: the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence, the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, east and southwest Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador. There are just over 4,000 licence holders across these regions. The annual crab harvest is managed on the basis of total allowable catches that are established through the development of an integrated fisheries management plan for each of the four geographic areas. Licence holders are allocated a specific tonnage of crab and a maximum number of traps.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="35">(1835)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1951767">Snow crab stocks are naturally variable and cyclical. Regardless of fishing activity, crab populations have periods of abundance followed by periods of decline. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951768">As most here will know, our snow crab fishery in the southern gulf is currently at the bottom of its natural cycle and, for conservation purposes, reductions in the total allowable catch needed to be made this year. This is never an easy decision for a fisheries minister to make, but it was necessary to ensure the stock remains healthy into the future.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951769">I have also instructed my department to provide as much flexibility as possible this year to help reduce costs to harvesters by allowing them to combine their operations for the season.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951770">My department's science has advised that the outlook for this stock in 2012 is positive if we use caution in the meantime. Therefore, I remain hopeful this stock will continue to play an important role for the Atlantic Canadian economy in the future. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951771">The species that has experienced the biggest growth in the past decade, particularly off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador, is the shrimp fishery. East coast shrimp was also the first Canadian fishery to attain eco-certification by the Marine Stewardship Council as being sustainable. We are very proud of this development because eco-certification will be both an important challenge and an opportunity for our fisheries in the future.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951772">Canada is the world's largest supplier of cold water shrimp. The cooked and peeled product, also known as shell-off, is a very valuable export for Canada. It is marketed primarily to Denmark, Japan, the Russian Federation and the United Kingdom, with major markets also in the United States and Europe. Offshore frozen at sea products are sold primarily to Russian and Asian markets. Combined, the export value for shrimp in 2009 was almost $330 million.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951773">The final fishery that contributes significantly to the overall value of landings in shellfish is scallop. Although scallops are found in adjacent waters in most provinces, the most important fishery takes place offshore, although still within Canada's 200 mile limit. The offshore scallop fishery is managed through the use of geographical zones ranging from St. Pierre Bank off Newfoundland to Georges Bank off southwest Nova Scotia. The primary markets for sea scallops are the United States and several members of the European Union, with an export value of close to $100 million.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951774">I am also pleased to announce that on March 25, 2010 the eastern Canada offshore sea scallop fishery received Marine Stewardship Council certification. This is the first scallop fishery in North America to receive this eco-certification and put this fishery on very solid ground to compete in the international market. Access to international markets is essential to Canada's fish and seafood industry, as 85% of its production is exported. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951775">In 2010 the European Union introduced a new regulation which requires exporting countries to provide catch certificates attesting that marine fish and seafood products are legally harvested. That is why the government provided $7.2 million over two years in budget 2010 to support the DFO Catch Certification Office. This office will certify that Canadian seafood exports are legally harvested, ensuring that the Canadian fish and seafood industry maintains access to our second largest export destination.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951776">From this brief description of these fisheries, I am sure members can appreciate the important role they play in communities on our eastern shores.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951777">As I have briefly outlined, these industries are highly valuable, yet face challenges brought about by international market fluctuations, changing market demands, and natural changes in biomass cycles.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951778">I look forward to tonight's debate and to a healthy and frank discussion on these important industries.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Gerry Byrne (Humber—St. Barbe—Baie Verte, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1951806">Madam Chair, there is no doubt that this industry in eastern Canada is in crisis. The history or the evolution of this crisis comes on the back of the 1990s' groundfish cuts and declines. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951807">Where groundfish fishermen once found themselves in peril, there was some light at the end of the tunnel for some involved in the shellfish industries. Lobster, crab and shrimp soon supplanted in landed value and export value some of the losses that occurred in the groundfish industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951808">Today, however, we have a very bleak situation. Groundfish never did recover, and the light at the end of the tunnel offered by the shellfish sector is now a dim and fading light. We have resource cuts and we have significant economic pressures on price. This is contributing to factors which are creating unparalleled poverty in many communities and regions throughout Atlantic Canada and Quebec.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951809">The minister spoke relatively eloquently on certain aspects of her duty. What she did not actually describe, however, was that she has failed not only in her duty to protect fish, but also in her duty to protect fishermen. She says that there is always a cause or a concern that fish populations fluctuate. There is no cause and no predictability to it. According to her, it just sometimes happens.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951810">Unfortunately, fishermen know the difference. What they want is leadership. They want a minister who is capable of providing that leadership, not only for the good and easy decisions of increasing quotas but also for the decisions of when they need to be cut.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951811">Specifically, there is a situation in the southern gulf of St. Lawrence where, amazingly, 63% of the quota was cut in just one season. Fishermen are scratching their heads. Plant workers are just amazed. Provincial governments are aghast at the fact that a 63% cut had to occur in one season.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951812"> They are not against cuts. They are not afraid of the tough decision. However, what they know, because they apply a factor called common sense, is that a cut of 63% in one year was not manufactured in one year. It was created over a series of years with which leadership and management should have dealt. That got blatantly exposed.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951813">While the minister may say to herself and to others, whoever might try to listen, that this was just a circumstance beyond her control, Department of Fisheries and Oceans shellfish scientist, Marc Lanteigne, who works in Moncton, told the real story on CBC New Brunswick. He said:</ParaText><ParaText id="1951814"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The decline has been quite dramatic over the last few years and this is why the management aspect of that fishery has had to make some difficult decisions.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951815">The Department of Fisheries and Oceans own scientists have been saying that they have been providing information to the minister that populations have been in decline over the last few years and this is why the management aspect of that fishery has had to make some very difficult decisions this year. These are the minister's own officials.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951816">What that is saying to each and every one of us is this stock of southern gulf crab has been in decline and scientists have been advising the minister that it has been in decline for several years and the minister has not exercise her fiduciary responsibility to do something about it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951817">It is all well and good to raise quotas when it is easy to do so. However, the minister's responsibility was to provide ease to the industry by doing what was right when it was required.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951818">Had quotas been cut on an incremental basis, as suggested by science, we would not see a 63% cut in just one year. We would not see an industry in turmoil today. What we would see is an industry that was capable of adjusting over the course of time to the realities of its industry. That is not the case we are seeing right now.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951819">Then we have the turmoil the minister caused in area 23 and area 24 on the east coast of Nova Scotia and Cape Breton. A management plan was put in place in 2005 with the consensus and co-operation with the entire industry, not necessarily the agreement of the entire industry, whereby the quota would be shared on a fifty-fifty split. What did the minister do in 2009? She tore up that management plan. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951820">The management plan said that as soon as the resource went over 9,700 tonnes, an agreement was struck that there would be a split of the quota on a fifty-fifty basis between the traditional fleet and the core company fleet. That quota went over 9,700 tonnes. The threshold was reached. </ParaText>

One month later, the minister came in and tore up the plans. It is absolutely disgusting. That is not stability for this industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951824">Then we have the issue in Newfoundland and Labrador where a very serious problem is occurring because of price and an industry looking to rationalize and restructure itself. There is nothing coming from the minister who has the fiduciary responsibility to set this industry on a proper course. She is the industry minister and the conservation minister for the fishery, but we have nothing.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951825">It strikes me odd that when we have a lobster industry in crisis, there is much fanfare about a $15 million program that is to provide aid for a $1 billion, normally, annual industry to be spread over 10,000 lobster licence holders who are spread over five eastern Canadian provinces: Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, P.E.I., Newfoundland and Labrador. That $15 million some may consider a significant amount of money. To put it in perspective, that is for 10,000 fishermen.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951826">Hon. members opposite are saying that is $15 million more than what we provided. What they are saying right now is that when prices of lobster were at $6.50 a pound in 2005, we should have been subsidizing the lobster industry. However, the industry was in crisis in 2009 when prices were at $3 a pound. They were at $6.50 a pound in 2005. Now when they hit $3 a pound in 2009, a $15 million program is provided, and the reaction from the industry is that this will not be enough.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951827">When the eligibility criteria was unveiled for the program, the reaction from the industry was that this would never be spent. The eligibility criteria was so discriminatory, exclusive to the real needs of the industry, the industry knew that the money would never be spent because nobody would be eligible. Guess what? Only 50% of the $15 million was spent, $8.5 million was disbursed to the fishermen and the government got an additional $1 million back from them anyway because it was all taxable. Therefore, of the $15 million program that was supposed to support them, only half was spent.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951828">I would like to know if the hon. minister would actually see fit to take the $7.5 million that went back to the government treasury and introduce a program, at least this year, and augment that which needs to be done for the people of New Brunswick, P.E.I., Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador and Quebec. I do not think we will ever see that happen.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951829">Then we have the shrimp fishery. In shrimp fishing area 6 on the northeast coast of Newfoundland and southern Labrador, we are seeing a rather similar circumstance occurring in the southern gulf of St. Lawrence. There is a recommendation now for a 30% cut in one season. That tells me one of two things. Either scientists were not doing their job over a succession of several years, or scientists were providing advice to the minister and she just failed to accept it and failed to act on it. To have a 30% cut in one year means either the stock was not being monitored properly on a year to year basis over the last number of years and suddenly a 30% cut was required. </ParaText>

The Department of Fisheries and Oceans is a huge boat, or perhaps a nice ship, a nice, big ocean liner. The rudder is broken, however, and unfortunately different situations have made this clear. There was the lobster problem last year, and the plan announced in June 2009 for the problems that started in 2008. Eventually we found out that $8.5 million was spent out of $15 million, but we only learned this in February 2010. These dates show that there is a problem somewhere.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951859">The minister and the department acknowledge that there is a problem with the cod and grey seal issues. But nothing has happened for three years. The only one who wins is the grey seal. The seals are fattening themselves up on cod, at the expense of the fishing fleet and at the expense of the communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951860">There is also the shrimp issue. Oddly enough, a quota was given to fishers on Prince Edward Island, even though there is no shrimp industry in Prince Edward Island. Oddly enough, the minister is from Prince Edward Island. This is another case of a broken rudder.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951861">I should add that this is unfortunately the case in the crab industry, as well, which is what we are concerned about today. When we hear that this year's crab decision was for conservation reasons, I would simply like the minister to consider the numbers I am about to give. An article published in the Quebec City newspaper <I>Le Soleil</I> talks about the catch rates authorized by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans: in 2006, 41.1%; in 2007, 37%; in 2008, 41.2% and in 2009, last year, 46.7%. So as we can see, ultimately, over the years, the conservation issue has not necessarily been the kick-starter for the department. It seems to have been based on rather flexible rules, perhaps even on geography.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951862">So this year, we ended up with a 63% cut. I think it is worth illustrating what this means for the people of Quebec. The landed value for Quebec was about $50 million in 2008. If I look at earlier figures, it was once much more than that. If we cut 63%, that means $30 million less in landed value. And as we know, those amounts are considerably increased if you add the work done in plants and so on. As we can see, this has a huge impact.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951863">When we hear about resource conservation—that is why I am repeating the figures we have already heard—it is not because of a situation that occurred by accident or very suddenly. We have known in one way or another for as long as I have been in politics. My father was a fisherman, and I already knew a bit about this. We all know very well that the resource fluctuates, that fish move around and that shellfish, especially snow crab, go through cycles. Some numbers are way up, while others are way down. People have been thinking about these questions for many years. We know that, with those numbers, we had a catch rate of about 50% of the biomass. Things were already pretty tough, and we knew we were in the low part of the resource's cycle.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951864">Thus, with respect to conservation, these figures were ignored, the requests by a number of scientists were completely forgotten and we concentrated on one thing. If the catch is abundant, many people will be put to work. It is unfortunate that in 2010 we have ended up with a 63% reduction. However, this could have been avoided; it was preventable, and that is the unfortunate thing about all this. However, we cannot change the past, even though I would like to. We find ourselves in a situation where the minister and the department no longer had a choice. We ended up with this 63% cut. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951865">The person or the group who made the decision to impose this cut and made this announcement has a certain degree of responsibility. I am certain that people in the department knew that this 63% cut would have consequences.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="15">(1915)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1951866">Almost everyone expected a 40% or 50% cut. That is what was being bandied about. I asked the minister about it weeks before the decision was made. I suggested figures of 40% or 50%. That was what we were hearing. It was difficult to believe that the cuts would be as high as 63%. We are now living with that decision and the 63% cut has had major repercussions everywhere. I remind members that prices had already been affected significantly. Add to that cuts in the catch and the impact has been even more severe.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951867">Worst of all is what we are hearing from the minister and the department. She seems to be saying that dealing with the impact of the cut is not part of her responsibilities. It is up to the provinces. It is up to Quebec to deal with it. It is up to others to deal with it. I do not believe that. It is a matter of dignity, rigour and responsibility.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951868">I am not attacking the <Affiliation DbId="128709" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries and Oceans</Affiliation> personally. I am certain that she is very responsible and concerned but there is a major problem and people everywhere are asking some serious questions. Not only are they asking serious questions, but they also have the answers. They believe that the government does not care in the least about the impact this has on the communities, the fishers and their helpers, and the fish plants.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951869">They say that they gave licence-holders the option to partner so that fishers and companies would not be hit as hard. That is one measure, but it too has an impact. Partnering means fewer employees and fewer helpers on those boats. It does have an impact.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951870">It is unfortunate that this decision about accountability was forced on us. Everyone agrees that people had no choice. I think that the government could have taken action sooner, but what is done is done. The people making decisions like that should be held responsible.

If not, fisheries will be treated as though they are in a vacuum.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951871">But that is not how things work. Things do not happen in a vacuum. There is a saying about how when a fish is pulled out of the water, its head is provincial and its tail federal. That sounds odd, but it reflects how responsibilities are shared.

Unfortunately, this department's rudder is broken. That is becoming increasingly clear.</ParaText>

But people are in this situation, this crisis. That is why I think we need to take responsible action.

It seems that these discussions can sometimes cause friction. We are all here to serve our constituents and our communities, and to think about what we can do for the people of our communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951904">I began to take an interest in the fisheries in 1988, when the government reduced crab quotas to 7,000 metric tonnes. At that time, the government said it had no choice, because otherwise we risked losing the industry altogether.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951905">Before I forget, I would like to tell the minister that there is a bit of a contradiction between the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and fishers. Last year, fishers said that quotas must not be reduced because there was enough crab in the ocean. So an agreement was reached between the <Affiliation DbId="128709" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries and Oceans</Affiliation> and fishers. The minister agreed not to reduce quotas. That is what I heard. However, she said that if the biomass decreased, she would have no choice but to reduce quotas by twice as much, and fishers would pay the price.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951906">I do not want to give any disinformation, but I hope everyone understands what I am saying.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951907">I hope the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans will listen to the suggestion I am about to make, and this is not the first time I have suggested it. Fishers are the ones who spend time on the water. DFO officials are saying that the biomass has decreased.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951908">We should turn to those with experience. I am not saying the others have no experience, even though it sounds that way. People with experience should be taking samples from the ocean together with the scientists. The scientists should get out of their offices. Some will say that they do not stay in their offices, but the fishers tell us the samples are not being taken properly. The minister knows that because I have already talked to her about this at various meetings. Fishers from the cod fishery and from the crab fishery all agree. They think the scientists are not taking the right approach but the scientists are saying they are doing things properly.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951909">Why not put these people on the same boat to see what is going on in the ocean? That is one of my proposals. I did not come up with that idea; the fishers did.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951910">The minister must know that this was proposed during a meeting last year. The same thing was proposed to the former Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. He was from Newfoundland and he agreed with this idea, but it seems we have been unable to convince the current minister.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951911">There are currently 130 crab fishers in the Atlantic. There are 85 in my riding alone. In my riding, most people finish on Friday. Those who do not finish on Friday have decided to prolong their fishing time.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951912">I may be wrong, but fishers have told me that they have made a catch but not kept it. One fisher with a quota of 18,000 pounds caught 15,000 pounds his first day out, but left 3,000 pounds at sea in order to get his lines and traps. He made those catches during the same weekend. That will end on Friday.</ParaText>

I am not accusing the minister. If the minister wants to make cuts of 63% and says that we have to save the fishery, I agree.

							<ParaText id="1951921">This was not the situation in the Mulroney era alone. When they closed the cod fishery, programs were put in place. After that, we had problems with the lobster fishery, for example. To quickly return to the crab fishery, it is not just the quotas that have been cut. People used to be paid $4 per pound and that has dropped to $1.75 or $2 per pound. Therefore, quotas have been cut, prices have dropped and these people are suffering. It is expensive to operate these industries. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951922">The same thing applies to the lobster industry. Fishers were paid $6 to $7 per pound.

He fished from May until late June, but he does not qualify. He did not make any money because of the costs. About $45 million has gone to the industry, but not to the fishers.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951924">The same is true of shrimp fishers. They are not getting any money.

I am not a scientist but the scientists said this, the fishermen said that and I said that we should put them together.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951954">When the member talks about the program of $245 million, I do not know where he gets that amount because the <Affiliation DbId="128694" Type="4">Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development</Affiliation> told me last week that it was $143 million. Every year $100 million goes to New Brunswick to look after the labour market. It is for the whole of New Brunswick for all issues. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951955">Because of the economic crisis, not the fishery, $43 million were added to it. In April, it was announced that there would be a 63% cut on the crab quota. It is a surplus from that, and that is why we are saying that we now need to look at special cases, like it did with other industries, such as forestry. The forestry sector said that it did not get enough. The government did it in Ontario in the car industry. I did not see members from the Conservative Party getting up to say that the money should not go to Ontario when plants were being closed. </ParaText>

I tip my hat to the Conservatives for doing what needed to be done to help that industry but it cannot stop there. We are in a federation and we need to help each other. We do not help just one province. We help every province that is having trouble. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951958">This is a surplus from what normally what would have happened.

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Kamp" id="3162805"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128851" Type="18">Mr. Randy Kamp (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1951959">Madam Chair, I am pleased to speak tonight to a sector that is vital to the Canadian economy. I will follow up on some of the points and comments made by the minister.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951960">This sector employs a lot of people and our Conservative government has shown our support time and time again for it. Those people who may watching may not realize the contribution that our seafood industry makes to our economy and our coastal communities. In fact, Canada is the world's sixth largest seafood exporter, with fish and seafood being Canada's largest single food export commodity. The seafood sector contributes $3.9 billion to the Canadian economy through the activities of harvesting, aquaculture and processing industries. Together, these industries employ approximately 80,000 people across the country, including fish harvesters, crew members and plant workers. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951961">The shellfish industry is at the heart of Canada's seafood sector, especially in the coastal communities and regional economies of eastern Canada, the subject of our debate tonight. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951962">Canada's commercial fisheries have evolved since the early 1990s, shifting away from groundfish to the more lucrative shellfish fisheries. Key species, such as lobsters, snow crab and shrimp, have become cornerstones of the commercial fishery driving industry growth for nearly two decades.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951963">To date, shellfish represents over three-quarters of the total value of commercial marine and freshwater catches in Canada. At the same time, shellfish aquaculture production has also grown considerably, increasing four times it value since 1990. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951964">The Atlantic provinces and Quebec define the Canadian shellfish industry. Total shellfish landings from Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Quebec account for over 90% of the overall landed value of shellfish in the country. In 2008, more than 429,000 tonnes of shellfish worth $1.4 billion were landed in those provinces. Lobster, snow crab and shrimp are the industry's most valuable species, but we cannot overlook other important products. such as scallops, clams, oysters and farmed mussels. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951965">The east coast shellfish industry contributes significantly to the rich variety of harvested and processed seafood products exported worldwide. Atlantic lobster is Canada's most lucrative fishery and provides a high quality, healthy food with high consumer appeal. In 2007, landings were valued at $560 million. In 2008, they climbed to $600 million and exports earned $920 million, or 24% of all Canadian seafood exports. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951966">There are almost 10,000 licensed lobster harvesters employing almost 30,000 Canadians and Canada produces over half of the world's lobster exports, mostly sold to U.S. markets. Hard shell lobster has higher value, often sold as live product, but also has higher storage costs. About one-third of lobster landings are soft shell, the lower value, processed into frozen products and inventories sold throughout the fall and winter months.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951967">The lobster industry competes directly with the Maine lobster industry in the U.S. which can often plug the U.S. market with live lobster. The luxury status accorded to Atlantic lobster as a food item, significantly affected it during the economic downturn during which demand dropped due to consumers cutting back on discretionary spending. Our government recognized that lobster-dependent harvesters were being severely impacted by the economic downturn, which is why we implemented the $15 million short-term transitional measures program to assist them.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951968"> It is important to recognize, not only how vital lobster and other shellfish are to Canada's economic prosperity, but also how flexible, resilient and innovative the industry is. For instance, a new dock-to-dock transport system recently made its debut in Halifax which will allow the shipment by a container ship of fresh seafood to European destinations. This could help reduce costs to Canadian lobster exporters.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951969">Snow crab is another important fishery in Canada and it is caught in the Atlantic provinces and in Quebec. It is a high volume, low value-added fishery and has a relatively short season with the majority of catches being landed within the first few weeks. Harvesters take their catch quickly in order to take advantage of early season high catch rates and also to avoid soft shell problems. Most snow crab exports are destined to mid-priced restaurants like buffets and casinos in the U.S. Despite supplying over one-third of the world's crab exports, Canada is considered a price-taker in this market. While it is not the only crab species harvested in Canada, the snow crab is by far the largest, making it the cornerstone of our Atlantic crab industry. In 2008, Canada exported $509 million worth of snow crab to 18 countries, with 67% to the United States, 21% to China and 9% to Japan. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="55">(1955)</Timestamp>
							<ParaText id="1951970">The northern shrimp fishery is found mainly in Newfoundland and Labrador, as well as Quebec and Nova Scotia. The main method for catching shrimp is trawling, which is fuel-intensive and vulnerable to upswings in fuel prices. The European Union is the main market for northern shrimp, particularly the UK and Denmark.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951971">Cold water shrimp prices have declined over the past 10 years because global markets have been saturated with larger warm water aquaculture shrimp and prawns. The financial crisis and economic recession have had predictable effects within the industry. The economic climate has also magnified the long-term structural challenges for businesses that carry high debt loads and have trouble accessing conventional financing.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951972">Total shellfish exports were $2.1 billion in 2009, dropping 8% from their value in 2008. At the same time, 2009 saw large decreases in the market prices for lobster, crab and shrimp, which generally represent half of Canada's fish and seafood exports.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951973">As general consumer spending decreased, the demand in import and export markets also plummeted, especially for high end seafood products. The drop in demand in Canada's major export markets, the United States, Japan and the EU, has been especially problematic for shellfish exports. A strong Canadian dollar has further diminished revenues and the relatively small margins for profit that did exist in some fisheries have been eroded or lost entirely.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951974">Steep increases in the price of oil have placed considerable pressures on the overall costs incurred by fishing fleets and processing plant operations. Fuel costs generally account for 10% of fleet operating costs but could be as high as 19% or 20% for relatively fuel-intensive fleets, such as shrimp harvesters.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951975">Recent domestic economic projections for Canada have been positive. Improved consumer confidence in both the Canadian and American markets is expected to boost the demand for fish and seafood products, however, anxiety over market prices remains. Expectations of a strong Canadian dollar in 2010 continue to put additional pressure on the industry. Forecasts of high crude oil prices throughout 2010 pose a significant potential burden on overall costs of operations. As well, resource stock declines will have direct short-term implications for affected fleets. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951976">The next two to five years will be an important period of transition for Canada's shellfish industry, as the need to increase productivity, become more innovative and strengthen its domestic and export markets reaches a critical level.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951977"> DFO is committed to facilitating industry transformation into a self-reliant, high value-added shellfish industry. We recognize that more emphasis in analyzing all the elements of the value chain is required, from harvesting to processing to marketing and distribution of shellfish products. We also must remain vigilant and proactive in terms of our programs and policies with respect to emerging drivers, such as new requirements related to catch certification, food safety and security and market access issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951978">For example, new European Union regulations that went into effect in January of this year require imports of seafood from other countries to have catch certificates to verify that the catch is legal and reported. The EU is the second largest market for Canada, importing almost $500 million in fish and seafood products in 2008.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951979">Our Conservative government recognized the importance of the EU market to the Canadian seafood industry, so we have acted decisively. Budget 2010 provided $7.2 million over two years to support a new catch certification office. Through this office, Fisheries and Oceans is issuing certificates to exporters, ensuring that the Canadian fish and seafood industry remains competitive and maintains employment in both the harvesting and fish processing sectors. We expect that consumers and global markets will increasingly demand this kind of evidence, and our government's foresight on this issue puts Canada's seafood industry in a competitive position.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951980">I know that change will not happen overnight. That is why our government remains committed to working with the industry and key stakeholders to improve industry resilience and prosperity so that it can withstand and rebound easily to short-term shocks, including economic, market or resource pressures. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951981">Atlantic Canadians know that it is our Conservative government that will support the long-term development of the seafood and shellfish sectors.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We talk about people making a living from this industry and how they are able to sustain a standard of living within their communities because of all the negative aspects that she mentioned. She mentioned the labour market agreements. Here is the problem: The labour market agreements do not provide EI benefits. They do not provide that extra amount of work, so they do not provide the extra weeks. In seasonal work, that is a problem. That puts that aside. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951984">Earlier in the season, earlier this year and even into last year, a memorandum of understanding was worked out between three particular groups. They included the union, specifically FFAW in Newfoundland and Labrador, producers as well as harvesters and, of course, the provincial government. They all came to the conclusion that there was a glaring absence of a federal presence. I know the government is talking about the provincial jurisdiction over this when it comes to the processing.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951985">However, I would like to remind the parliamentary secretary before he answers that in the mid-1990s, the Liberal government brought forward a program which allowed people to ease out of the industry in the processing sector. Before he uses that as an excuse, I do not think it is much of one. </ParaText><ParaText id="1951986">What is the government's involvement in allowing people to either ease out of the industry or to continue in a period of growth?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

In fact, it is a cyclical industry and a cyclical resource. Shrimp is not, but crab is, for example, and it tends to go up and down. That is why I think the province is closer to the action. It is certainly in a much better place to help those kinds of problems.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951988">Our government has invested in additional training programs. That is part of the labour market dollars that have come to the provinces. Our preference is for people to work, not to just get a cheque at the end of the year for not working. I am sure the fishers would like that as well, but because it is the kind of industry where there are ups and downs, these programs need to be in place to allow people to retrain into other industries.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951989">We have those.

The ultimate responsibility for the management of the fisheries lies with the <Affiliation DbId="128709" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries and Oceans</Affiliation>. It has been said here that the advice we got and which we acted upon last year in the southern gulf said that we should not cut. We acted on that advice.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951991">My son is seven years old. He was riding his bike the other day and he rode it down a hill with his friends.

I told him not to just follow his friends, but to do what is right.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1951992">It seems to me there is a disconnect here. The minister is saying that they told her to do it, so she had no choice, that she just did what she was told. The truth is that the minister was told by DFO science for several years previous to this year to make cuts. She did not listen. She skinned her knee and the problem is that she skinned the knee of every crab fisherman in the southern gulf. If there was one responsible action that could have been taken, it would have been to take the necessary cuts when they were prescribed by DFO science, not to wait for it to build up.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951993">There is an illusion here that they will not do what happened to northern cod. They did exactly that, because this is exactly what happened with northern cod. Scientific advice came in to Bernard Valcourt, Tom Siddon, John Crosbie and Ross Reid in 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991 and finally in 1992. They did not take the advice. Finally, John Crosbie had to shut the whole works down.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951994">That is exactly what happened in the southern gulf. Scientific advice was coming in.

The dismay on the wharf right now in eastern Canada is palpable. If one were to go to the end of the wharf to talk to the fishermen or talk to people in the plants, one would find they are scared to death as to what is going to happen this year.</ParaText><ParaText id="1951999">Let me ask a specific question. I know the minister is well briefed on this topic and I know she was gracious enough to meet with the fishermen when they came to Ottawa to present their case. She knows it well. It is about the area 19 fishermen and the co-management plan they have worked under for the last number of years. </ParaText><ParaText id="1952000">They have taken decreases over the last number of years on their own. They have followed the recommendations of science and have undertaken some very aggressive measures as far as conservation of the resource goes.

This is an important issue, and I know that he has pressed hard to make this debate possible this evening to allow this issue to be brought to the fore.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952006">There was a great deal of excitement in the House today. I know that people back home and most Canadians are sort of glued to the television right now as Montreal has come up on a 4-0 lead right now.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952007">There are a lot of Habs fans back in my riding of Cape Breton—Canso. There are a number of Pittsburgh fans there as well, Sidney Crosby being a Nova Scotia boy, Marc-André Fleury being a former Cape Breton Screaming Eagle, a great major junior hockey team. Unfortunately he has not had a great night. He has had a tough night at the office tonight.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952008">As much interest as there is in the hockey game, I know that people from Tor Bay to Glace Bay and from Margaree Harbour up to Cheticamp will be checking in and watching this debate unfold this evening. There is a great deal of concern and a great deal of anxiety in these communities because the livelihood of so many families is inextricably linked to the fishery.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952009">With what has gone on in the past number of years, they have been very concerned for a number of years. I guess this is the year that the chickens come to roost as far as the situation in the southern gulf is concerned, and certainly not just with crab but also with lobster. There is a great deal of concern.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952010">We have to put a real face on this. We have to look at the lives that this impacts. </ParaText><ParaText id="1952011">I got a call today from someone in Cheticamp. The plant workers in Cheticamp were notified today that things are not looking good up there. They are looking at 80 job layoffs in the next number of days just because the resource is not there. That is starting to hit home now. </ParaText><ParaText id="1952012">If they are not able to get work this year, they are going to look at going somewhere else to try to find employment. That is what they have to do to feed their families. What happens as a result is that should the plant fire up again and get a little more resource to process, the plant will be handcuffed because it will not have the workers. The workers will vacate. The workers will leave the community, and that group of workers will be lost. That is devastating.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952013">It is close to home for me. I am married to a Hopkins. The Hopkins name is known in Cape Breton and in Newfoundland. It is a family-owned fish processing business in Cow Head, Newfoundland. My father-in-law runs the second-generation family business. They have been in the fishery since the 1940s. They have grown up in the fishery.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952014">He said he is more nervous this year. He is frightened this year about the way the prices will impact the season. Certainly last year in the lobster fishery back home, lobster started out at about $4.25 a pound. Down in Southwest Nova right now lobster is running at about $3.25 a pound. That is money right off the top. That is money out of a household that is trying to feed a family and pay the bills.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952015">There are three things I want to talk about in this debate. The government has said this is all about science. There has been good science all along. The signs have been there, but they have been ignored. They have been neglected. That is what is of concern. This is not just about this year. This is about going forward. This is about the long-term survival of the fishing industry. That is what is concerning us. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="15">(2015)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1952016">The lobster and the crab are so inextricably linked. If things are not so good in the crab industry, the fishermen have the lobster and they are able to generate some additional revenue. If the lobster is down a little, some crab share allows them the opportunity to keep the enterprise moving and to pay the bills.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952017">In the lobster industry all the LFAs in the gulf have talked about a 10 point plan. It was an aggressive conservation plan where each of the LFAs were able to look at a number of conservation measures. They were able to take whatever measures would suit them best. It was not a one-size-fits-all. They were able to pick from the number of measures and put them together. Each measure was assigned an amount. If their plans totalled 10 points, they were granted the ability to fish that season.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952018">All indications from the lobster groups was that they wanted to make this mandatory. The direction the officials of DFO was that they wanted to make this mandatory. They wanted the LFAs to all enter in. They had to sign on for a 10 point plan in order to proceed in the upcoming season.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952019">Last year the minister had an opportunity to embark on those conservation measures and she stepped back from that. She made it voluntary and left it up to the individual LFAs.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952020">Some had been ahead of the curve. Some had entered into these measures, thinking that this was coming and it was going to be mandatory. They thought they would get a jump on it. Now they are left holding the bag. They are being penalized now because they have moved already on their own for the right reasons, thinking it would become mandatory. However, it has not and it will not be mandatory this coming year. That was a mistake. It was a total ignorance of the science.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952021">I talked about area 19 and the fishermen. I have talked about the measures they have embarked on in the last number of years. The minister should have been taking lessons from those snow crab fishermen. They have done a spring survey, which has the most accurate results. They have been doing this since 2004. They went far beyond on their softshell protocol, very robust. They have put in additional measures as far as observer coverage in the zone. They have undertaken these measures on their own.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952022">The minister could have been taking a lead from this fisheries group. Every time I talk to DFO officials, they make reference to the group of fishermen in area 19 and that co-management plan. They hold that up as the template. They say that this is how a fishery should be run because the guys are committed. They believe in the sharing of the resource. They have allowed other entrants into their area. They have been very proactive in those measures and they have been proactive with conservation measures as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952023">The minister should have been watching this. This is how one goes about one's business. The science has been there over the last number of years and she has ignored it. There could have been gradual reductions over the last number of years, but instead the hammer came down this year. The impact on the markets could have been managed over the last number of years.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952024">The other issue I want to speak about is the management agreement in area 23. It was an agreement that was signed off in 2005. It was very clearcut. My colleague, our fisheries critic, has mentioned it already. This agreement was in place. It was accepted by the fishers in this area and that was cast aside. </ParaText><ParaText id="1952025">A new licence was issued. Tim Rhyno won the lottery, as far as picking up a licence in that area. Meanwhile 650 new entrants into that fishery who expected to become equal partners in that fishery have now been ignored. The fifty-fifty sharing agreement once the tonnage has reached 9,700 tonnes has been ignored. That agreement has been torn up and cast aside</ParaText>

Really there is no answer. The decision has been made. It is the wrong decision. It was a decision that has been appealed, the granting of the Tim Rhyno licence. He had gone through an appeal process a number of times with the previous government and he was refused. All the correspondence from DFO had recommended against it at all levels of the appeal. However, went it reached the minister's predecessor, that changed.

We knew what was going on, and as the fisheries minister back then he would know this as well. A small number of people were making substantive amounts of money. The benefit of the fishery really rests in the hands of very few. Therefore, our party has continued to believe in the sharing of the resource. We believe an independent fisherman is an entrepreneur. If people have access to additional opportunities of revenue, if they have different resources they are able to harvest, if one is down on one particular year then they can rely on some revenue source from the other one. It is a diversity within that small enterprise and that is what builds equity within those businesses.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952048">However, as a result of those fires, riots and uproar, there was the sharing of the resource beyond that.

Being from New Brunswick, I certainly understand some of the arguments that my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128673" Type="2">Acadie—Bathurst</Affiliation> was making. Even though I do not have any crab in my riding, I do have a number of potato producers and a forestry sector. I tend to equate some of the issues that we have in terms of barrels and board feet. It is a bit of a different argument, but I am pleased to speak today on the impact of the snow crab fishery on the communities in New Brunswick and the Atlantic provinces.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952050">While I understand the difficulties that these regions are facing and how this debate can get very emotional, because it is impacting a number of communities and families, it is important to look at the facts and ensure we base our decisions with the future of the industry in mind.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952051">Since 1966 the snow crab fishery in this area has grown rapidly, peaking at more than 33,000 tonnes in 1982. Landings have fluctuated since this peak to as low as 8,900 tonnes in 1990 and as high as more than 36,000 tonnes in 2005. Landings last year were just under 24,000 tonnes.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952052">It is clear that the snow crab stocks, when we look at this data, are cyclical in nature. The size of the stocks for the given year have been provided by scientists from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans who created the detailed annual assessment based on trawl surveys of the available snow crab biomass. These trawl surveys show that the 2005 fishery was the peak of the most recent cycle and the stock has been in a declining phase since that point in time.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952053">Management decisions and quota levels are guided by the annual science assessment and advice as well as input from industry stakeholders. The annual quota has been gradually reduced to reflect the snow crab's natural cycle. The most recent data prepared in 2009 was used to provide advice on this year's quotas in February.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952054">Since 2008 Fisheries and Oceans Canada has been developing a precautionary approach framework for the southern gulf snow crab fishery. This will reinforce the fishery's long-term sustainability and is one of the department's objectives to achieve sustainable fisheries based on strong conservation outcomes.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952055">A fishery managed under such a framework fits well with eco-certification guidelines and can provide a fishery with a competitive market advantage. We are seeing more and more of that around the world today as we are looking at eco-certification for a number of our fisheries. Hopefully, at some point in time, the committee on fisheries and oceans will get a chance to start looking at eco-certification.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952056">In recent years Fisheries and Oceans Canada has also been working with industry to develop a long-term harvesting strategy. Using precautionary approach principles, departmental scientists identified appropriate reference levels for this fishery. With industry input, decision-making rules-based on the precautionary approach are being developed for establishing the annual quota. These rules will support stock conservation while providing predictability and stability so the industry can plan for the future.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952057">Members opposite will know to put things in perspective when they consider the current situation in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence snow crab fishery. Trends in world snow crab stocks are well studied and are known to be cyclical in nature. The southern gulf is no exception and it is the cyclical nature of snow crab that has led to the decline in recent years. This decline was expected and we expect to return to abundance in the coming years.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952058">I just wanted to refer to a study that was done for the province of New Brunswick back in 2007 by GTA Fisheries Consultants. It has a nice chart on page 12 that shows that trend. It is very evident on these cycles that we can expect that and what was happening this year could eventually be expected as well.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="1952059">That is one of the reasons the minister announced that she will stabilize access to the crab fishery for the next five years. The fleets will be able to plan their fishing so that it is viable throughout the natural cycle. While there might always be uncertainty in the fishery, access should not have to be part of that uncertainty.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="35">(2035)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="1952060">That being said, the biomass has declined to a level where it is important to establish stringent management measures to protect the spawning portion of the stock. In this way, we can avoid extending the current period of low biomass. </ParaText><ParaText id="1952061">After two weeks of fishing, harvesters are claiming a high abundance of crab. As for the rest of the fishery, we should not base our decisions for future actions on impressions and assumptions. Preliminary reports from independent dockside observers indicate that catch levels thus far are much lower than last year. </ParaText><ParaText id="1952062">In fact, for the first week of 2010, the catch rate is the lowest observed in the past six years, 18% lower than last year, and 50% lower than in 2006. Additionally, molting crabs, which have soft shells and are extremely vulnerable to injury, are in much greater abundance this year. This has actually necessitated the closure of some portions of the crab fishing area. </ParaText><ParaText id="1952063">All these facts show that the minister took the best decision under the circumstances. It was a difficult decision, as she indicated earlier, but a sound one. Moreover, even after cutting the quota in area 12 to 7,700 tonnes, there remains a risk of further stock declines in 2011. This quota does, however, provide the best balance. It allows some harvest to stakeholders while ensuring that the stock is able to rebuild.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="1952064">By establishing Gulf of St. Lawrence snow crab quotas for 2010, the minister is putting the priority on preserving the resource. This decision was not made lightly. Our government recognizes that this is a significant reduction compared to last year and that crab fishers, plant workers and the community will all face hard times.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="1952065">As a consequence, the minister has instructed officials from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans to offer the maximum flexibility for fish harvesters. This will help them to achieve efficiencies and reduce their operating costs.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952066">Restrictions around quota transfers between crab fishing enterprises are being lifted for 2010, enabling harvesters to consolidate operations. It will allow for individual harvesters to make business decisions, for example, reducing or increasing their investments in the fishery over the next few years, based on their needs. </ParaText><ParaText id="1952067">This quota transfer flexibility goes hand-in-hand with the partnering options provided this year to harvesters. Under these arrangements, two harvesters can fish their quota from the same boat, significantly decreasing costs. </ParaText><ParaText id="1952068">The department is taking care to respect existing licensing policy. Fish harvesters subject to the owner-operator policy will require to be on board the fishing vessel.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952069">The industry has already taken advantage of these measures. To date, around 40% of licence holders have used the quota transfer option and some new partnerships have been formed in 2010. </ParaText><ParaText id="1952070">These flexibility measures will remain in place until stocks return to the higher end of the cycle. If we decide to continue this increased flexibility in future years, it is likely that their use by the industry will increase. In any case, the lessons learned from these changes to licensing policy and fisheries operations will be very useful as the department moves forward with its ongoing reform of existing policy.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952071">I would also like to mention the department's continued investment in science. In order to appropriately manage the resource and support longer term sustainability of the fishery, DFO has kept its science base up to date to enhance its precautionary approach to the management of the stock. This approach will improve the long-term predictability of fishery management decisions so that the industry can plan for the future.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="1952072">To finish, I would like to assure people that our government understands that these are difficult times for the crab fishery and the entire industry.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="1952073">It is our responsibility to ensure the sustainability of this precious resource as communities in New Brunswick and my home province as well as other provinces depend on it. Conservation has to remain our top priority so we can benefit and continue to enjoy the opportunities of this resource for many years to come.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

He did talk about the auto industry and I think everybody in the House should recognize the very integrated nature of that industry between Canada and the U.S., and the importance of us working with the U.S. on that.

We have invested over $200 million under the economic action plan last year to bring our wharves up to a safe standard.

I think that is important because that represents a collaboration with the provinces. One of the things about signing these labour market development agreements is the fact that each of these provinces gets a chance to invest in the things that are different in their province because not every province is the same. </ParaText><ParaText id="1952086">The province of New Brunswick has $245 million, which allows it to invest in things like getting people to move to different areas, to actually invest.

The same problems are still in the industry today that have been there for many years. It involves, always, a challenge between DFO science and the fishers.

The province of New Brunswick must be getting $1.5 billion through the labour market development agreement.

Then when people from the forestry industry meet with those same individuals, they are told they have $240 million to meet their needs.

Today we find ourselves here to address a crisis for people who depend on this industry. We are also here to address an injustice that has been precipitated against those very fishers, workers and first nations.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952098">It has become clear that the minister has had the opportunity to avoid the situation, but she did not act. Now so many people will suffer due to this inaction. I will speak more to that in a moment.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952099">First I would like to talk a little bit about the snow crab fishery as a whole, the immediate crisis and some of the amazing people who participate in it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952100">Earlier this year, the <Affiliation DbId="128709" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries and Oceans</Affiliation> announced a 63% cut to the total allowable catch of snow crab in the Saint Lawrence region. The impact of this decision will have an effect on the economy of the entire region. In straightforward terms, we are talking about an overall reduction in quota from 20,400 tons, the level it was in 2009, to 7,700 tons for the 2010 season. That is a very deep cut to a large sector of the economy.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952101">This will have an enormous impact on the fishers, some of whom have fished snow crab all their lives. Some families' yearly incomes rely heavily on the fishery. What are we to tell them about this situation, that we are sorry? When they cannot afford to pay their bills, what are they to do? All this because someone in Ottawa made a mistake. I do not think this is good enough.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952102">It is not only the fishers who will be affected by this massive slash to the quota. This year less crab will be processed and the fish plant workers who rely on snow crab will be negatively affected. For example, in New Brunswick roughly 1,500 fish plant workers were employed in snow crab processing last year, according to the 2009 registry on fish plant workers. Another 250 to 300 did occasional work.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952103">Last year, fish plant workers had about nine weeks of work processing crab in the spring and a few more weeks in the summer. This year they will only get about three weeks of work in the spring. That means last year most of them banked more than 200 hours and this year they will be lucky to bank 85.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952104">For the riding of my hon. colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128673" Type="2">Acadie—Bathurst</Affiliation>, this will deal a significant blow to the local economies and leave many families with little or nothing to fall back on. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952105">Then there are the first nations who only gained access to the fishery in 1999 and hold communal licences. A communal licence represents the entire community, and for first nations fishers it is not a private enterprise. They take profits generated and use them to support programs, which are underfunded by the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952106"> They use this money to enhance their education student allowances and to support cultural and language programs. It is used to create employment in the community for people who otherwise would not have an income over the winter. This reduction punishes them as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952107">What we are talking about here is entire communities built around the fishery all across the Atlantic region and Quebec, which will be significantly impacted by the reduction.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952108">The Department of Fisheries and Oceans says it had to take desperate measures. How did it get to this, where such drastic reductions had to come all at once? Where was the minister last year or the year before or before that?</ParaText><ParaText id="1952109">What do we say to those communities that are now faced with this desperate situation? These communities will suffer greatly because of drastic measures that could and should have been avoided. Could this possibly come at a worse time, just when we are climbing out of the most significant economic downturn in nearly 100 years?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952110">I would like to take a few moments to tell this House about an alternative management structure that the DFO had previously implemented in a neighbouring area, area 19.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952111">Recently I had the opportunity to talk with Basil MacLean, president of Area 19 Crab Fishermen's Association. Mr. MacLean got in touch with me because he was concerned about the situation that area 12 fishers find themselves in, and he wanted to discuss why the situation was different and why he did not believe that the TAC reduction should be imposed on him or fishers in his area, area 19.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="20" Mn="50">(2050)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1952112">Mr. MacLean and the area 19 fishers believe that their crab stock is in good shape. He says that they do not face the same problem of depletion in their area, as is the case in area 12. The reason they say this is that they have been directly involved in the management of the fishery in conjunction with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. Unlike area 12, area 19 has an integrated fisheries management plan and has had one since 2001. Fishers from this region have been much more involved in determining the management of the fishery.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952113">The DFO website explains that integrated fisheries management seeks to introduce “a more structured, systematic and inclusive approach to fisheries management” where:</ParaText><ParaText id="1952114"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...resource users and DFO work together to develop clear, measurable, long-term fisheries management objectives for a fishery. On a more technical level [it] provides a framework to quantify fisheries management objectives as well as risk analysis processes that result in the development of specific management strategies designed to achieve specific objectives. DFO sectors including (science, resource management and enforcement) play key roles and interact with the fishing industry as part of the...process.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952115">It is clear that the fishers of area 19 are much more involved in the everyday conduct and management of that fishery. By direct involvement in the creation of long-term, measurable objectives for their fisheries, the fishers come into direct contact with the science, resource management and enforcement arms of DFO, allowing them to have a much better sense of the state of their fishery.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952116">This means that decisions being made in Ottawa are being made in consultation with people on the ground. When they were told by DFO scientists that their biomass had dropped last year, the fishers came together and decided what to do. In line with that precautionary approach, they chose to take less than the recommendation, to voluntarily bring down their TAC, in order to cushion them against the shock they knew was coming this year.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952117">What is more, in 2004, when a crisis arose in the fishery and for conservation reasons the department prematurely closed the fishery, it was supported by the Area 19 Snow Crab Fishermen's Association, even though the fishery was closed before several fishers could begin fishing. Recognizing that this was not fair, it was mutually agreed that actions should be taken to change how sharing took place in order to ensure that this circumstance would not occur again in future seasons.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952118">They created a new co-management agreement. At a special meeting on April 24, 2005, the Area 19 Snow Crab Fishermen's Association passed a motion to request that DFO provide regular access to all temporary access fishers under a revised co-management arrangement. This process was supported by the majority of 73 temporary and 111 permanent fishers.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952119">DFO received representation from the Area 19 Snow Crab Fishermen's Association, identifying the need for revisions to the existing co-management agreement to reflect permanent access for the 73 temporary allocation holders. DFO then carried out a process of negotiations with the Area 19 Snow Crab Fishermen's Association. This process resulted in points of agreement that received ministerial approval in 2005 and provide the guiding principles for amendments to the multi-year integrated fisheries management plan.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952120">One can see that when a problem arose in the fishery, one that might have divided the traditional fishers and the new-licence fishers, because the fishers themselves were accustomed to dealing with the fishery and because they were completely involved, they solved it themselves. The co-management strategy gave these fishers recourse to manage not only their crab stock, but also their individual fishing rights.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952121">As my time is running short, I would just like to conclude by thanking Ms. Nellie Barker Stevens, coordinator of the Eastern Shore Fishermen's Protective Association, for all her support and counsel through this process. I would also like to thank Basil MacLean, the president of the Area 19 Snow Crab Fishermen's Association, for taking the time to share his insights with me and provide his feedback.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I have enjoyed the debate here this evening. We have heard many different opinions and different points of view come across. The minister has received lots of advice and lots of criticisms this evening but he fact remains that the decision the minister took in this situation was a decision taken with one goal in mind, and that was to help sustain the industry for the future.

The answer given by the member for Acadie--Bathurst was that he would get the fishermen together with the scientists and put them on the same boat.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952152">The minister consulted with the fishermen and took advice from the DFO scientists and made a decision taking into consideration that advice. The minister has listened to the fishery in the past. Last year she met with those people in fishery and talked about the need for a reduction in the TAC but they did not believe the science last year. They had difficulty with the science. The minister told them very clearly that she was prepared to make an exception but that if the science did not come back with a different position the following year, that she would have no choice but to implement that decision based on the science, and she did that. The industry was fully aware of the direction that the minister was planning to take.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952153"> Tonight I want to talk about the province of New Brunswick. It is a terrific place and I did have the pleasure at one time of being the minister responsible for agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture. The member for <Affiliation DbId="128673" Type="2">Acadie—Bathurst</Affiliation> raised that point here this evening. When I was a minister at that time there was consultation with the federal level of government. I know there has been consultation this time with the federal and provincial ministers. Some of the indignation we have heard from the provincial government around the minister's decision has given me cause for concern.</ParaText>

He spoke of the need for a compensation program but never raised the issue of compensation with the federal <Affiliation DbId="128709" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries and Oceans</Affiliation>. </ParaText><ParaText id="1952155">I would have to question the motivation here and the timing. It could be the fact that there is a provincial election coming this year and that this might be an issue that could be politically sensitive. It has been a politically sensitive issue in the past.

These changes resulted in significant cuts to the TAC: 63% in one year. My colleague from Humber—St. Barbe—Baie Verte has an important responsibility as our party's fisheries critic. For some time now, he has been asking the government important questions about why it waited so long to take action before this crisis started.

I have enormous respect for the office of the <Affiliation DbId="128709" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries and Oceans</Affiliation>, not only because my father was the first person to occupy it when the department was created in 1979, but because I think all of us who care about the fishery and about coastal communities on all of Canada's coasts understand the important responsibility the man or woman who occupies the office holds in the livelihoods of thousands of families and coastal communities that depend on her decisions and the decisions of the government.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952198">With a lot of sincerity, the minister's interest in this issue is important to all of us. The tone of tonight's debate tells us that there is in fact a lot of common ground on all sides of the House. Members who have the privilege of representing regions that have a large concentration of fishers, who benefit from the economic activity in the fishing industry, understand that we need to work together to try to arrive at solutions that are reasonable and progressive.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952199">I hope that in tonight's brief discussion I can offer my views on some possible solutions to what is a very serious crisis in the east coast shellfish industry.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="1952200">I mentioned the significant cuts to the TAC. There is no doubt that a single huge cut like that poses a major challenge not only for fishers, but also for those who work in processing plants. Plant workers are often the unintended victims of these cuts. </ParaText><ParaText id="1952201">In the past, my colleagues have often talked about trying to accommodate the seasonal nature of this work, which is completely dependent on the crab fishery, an unstable industry. One strategy involved employment insurance.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952202">However, we believe that the government can do more to support plant workers by recognizing that employment insurance is critical to the economic survival of workers' families and their communities. However, the government also needs to recognize that economic diversification in coastal regions is critical. There are literally thousands of families that depend on jobs related to processing. The major reduction announced by the minister will have a devastating effect on these families because they will not be able to accumulate enough weeks of work to qualify for employment insurance. Even people who do qualify do not usually get enough weeks to make it to the next season.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="1952203">One of the great challenges in managing an industry as difficult as the snow crab industry is the whole question around the sharing of the quota. The government made a decision to reduce, in a dramatic way, the quota this year. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128675" Type="2">Humber—St. Barbe—Baie Verte</Affiliation> has been very articulate that it should have done so in a more measured way. It should have begun the reduction earlier and not waited so long for one sudden drop as we saw this year.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952204">However, if we are to be fair with the government, we need to recognize a decision the minister made, which is certainly important for my constituency. Her decision was to maintain the permanency of the access given to the non-traditional fishers. These are inshore fishermen in my riding and others along the coast, including in the minister's own riding. The minister and I are separated by the Northumberland Strait. From my house in Grande-Digue, New Brunswick, I can see the lights of Summerside on a clear evening. Therefore, the minister knows, as well as I do, the importance of the lobster industry in communities like she and I represent. That is why it is important to thank the government and recognize that its continuation of a previous government's decision to maintain a permanent sharing arrangement is very important for the stability of this industry.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952205">The lobster industry in my constituency has been very affected over recent years. Fishermen, for example, around the Confederation Bridge, those who fish out of Cape Tormentine, Murray Corner, even Petit Cap, tell me that one of the real challenges for them has been the Confederation Bridge. Various surveys around siltation, tidal patterns and water flow have indicated that the lobster grounds in and around the bridge have been severely affected. These fishermen are forced to go much further north to set their traps at a time when fuel prices can be prohibitive. Landings have come down dramatically. As members know, even from some communities, for example, in Kingston, Ontario, the lobster landings have gone down to a price that is also very low. This has led to serious economic hardship. That is why the government missed an occasion to do something important around the lobster licence retirement program. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952206">The minister understands there is considerable pressure from fishers on both sides of the Northumberland Strait to look at measures that will reduce the fishing effort. That will help fishers who are basically eking out a very modest living and who often are unable, for example, to employ a helper on a boat for an extended period of time. My colleague from Saint John referred to some of the changes made with respect to groundfish in Newfoundland and Labrador.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952207"> In area 25 the lobster fishery is in that kind of crisis. This important effort to reduce the fishing effort through a licence retirement program is serious. Rather than asking the fishermen's union to borrow money from a provincial government and use crab revenue, which is dramatically diminished, as a way to finance an inadequate plan, the government could have put up public money. It could have successfully given the younger fishers a chance for a more prosperous future and allowed older fishermen to retire from the industry with some dignity. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952208">That has been missing in the government's plans. The crab crisis makes it worse. At the end of the day, all of us on this side want to stand with those fishing communities that are going through a very difficult time. We want to support the plant workers through active measures and employment insurance that meets their needs. However, we also recognize that an immediate licence retirement program offers the best hope to answer the critical need in the lobster fishery that I represent. I hope the minister will see fit to implement such a plan.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

There is a problem with that fund. At the time, I thought that if the government was allocating money for sustainability in the lobster fishery, on the face of it, that made sense. We had asked the government for a program like that. Groups like the Maritime Fishermen's Union, which represents the inshore fishermen in my area, had been calling on the government to do that.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952214">I have spoken to a number of fishermen in my constituency, fishermen the minister probably knows, from Murray Corner and Cape Tormentine. They are people like Gary O'Hanley and Bernie Briggs, president of the Botsford Professional Fishermen's Association, who the minister will probably know from her time in the provincial Government of Prince Edward Island. They are people like Steward Murray, who sadly passed away this year. These fishermen had recognized the need for a rationalization program, as the minister noted.</ParaText>

The $50 million announcement on a wharf in the constituency of <Affiliation DbId="128471" Type="2">Miramichi</Affiliation> on a summer afternoon was a great announcement. Unfortunately the fishermen who had applied under this program came to see me this winter and spring. They had these nice letters explaining why they did not qualify. They did not have a certain percentage of their income that was dependent on lobster, or they were 3% less than the cutoff or their landings had not gone down by the requisite percentage.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952216">At the end of the day, these fishermen are in very difficult economic circumstances. The government designed a program that was no doubt well intentioned, but unfortunately missed the target. It announced a $50 million fund. Out of a total of $50 million, $15 million is allocated and only $8.5 million gets out the door. It is all taxable money. The government recuperates a considerable amount of that money.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952217">At the end of the day, though it may have had all the best intentions in the world, the government, with respect, missed the target.

The problem is that there are two ways to restructure the fishery. One is through a compassionate, responsible, well-ordered rationalization plan through public funds. The other is through the stark, deep, dark, very painful experience of a sheriff's order for foreclosure. That is the other way this is going to occur.

If one is cynical, one could think that the government actually thought the rationalization plan should be trustees in bankruptcy, sheriffs arriving with forfeiture orders, taking people's leased trucks on the backs of tow trucks and seizing assets of a fishing enterprise. </ParaText><ParaText id="1952224">I cannot pretend to know every region of the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, but in my own riding, and the fishing industry is obviously very important to me and the communities, I can say that there are a number of older fishermen, people who probably do not have debts on their boats and have paid off the debt they originally had when they bought their fishing enterprise, who are basically participating marginally in a viable fishing enterprise. </ParaText><ParaText id="1952225">Some of them cannot afford helpers and many of them are in fact fishing alone. The captain or the skipper goes out on his own on a boat, which represents some safety challenges. These are often older fishermen.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952226">The reason they are in this industry is that the government has not allowed them to find a way to exit the industry. It does not have to be an exaggerated, indefensible, federally funded buyout program, but there has to be a reasonable way to remove these people from the industry, give them some dignity in retirement and allow the younger fishermen who want to stay in the industry or become professional fishermen to have the prospect of earning a reasonable living, to be able to borrow money, improve their boats or buy new ones, to perhaps get into other fishing activities in order to diversify their enterprises. None of that is possible because of the economic circumstances in which these people currently find themselves. </ParaText><ParaText id="1952227">The minister knows and cares about the fishing industry.

I have worked as a professional fishing guide. I have worked as a fisheries technician for the Alberta fish and wildlife department. I have worked as a conservation officer and as a national park warden enforcing the Fisheries Act. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952233">I will keep to my notes on the facts pertaining to the scientific end of things because that is where I am most comfortable in having my discussions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952234">I would like to provide some important context about the science that lies behind the snow crab quotas allotted by Fisheries and Oceans Canada to the licence holders.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952235">Canada relies on scientific data to make informed decisions about the management of all stocks, whether they are freshwater stocks, finfish stocks or shellfish stocks, and that definitely includes snow crab.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952236">It is impossible to determine the precise number of snow crab in the Gulf of St. Lawrence at any given moment, just as it is impossible to determine how many walleye there are in Pigeon Lake in Alberta. We do not know exactly how many there are. They do not have passports. They do not register. We do not even know how many Canadians are living in Canada. We even guess at that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952237">Simply put, no perfect method exists to estimate the exact size of any wild stock. Science uses wildlife management. Species management relies on a variety of techniques to make our best estimate. Our best hope is to apply those scientifically proven methods in a consistent and meticulous manner to provide the best estimate of abundance with the technology presently available and to continually strive to improve sampling and analytical methodologies. That is precisely the approach followed by Fisheries and Oceans Canada in the snow crab fishery.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952238">Prior to the 1980s, fishers were the primary source of data about the health of snow crab stocks. At that time fisheries officials would review log books and reported landings to estimate the size of the snow crab stock.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952239">These methods documented sizeable swings in the annual snow crab harvest in the southern portion of the gulf. From its humble beginnings in the mid-1960s, the harvest grew to exceed 33,000 tonnes in 1982, then dropped to 13,600 tonnes in 1987, and fell below 9,000 tonnes three years later. Since then landings have continued to fluctuate significantly.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952240">In 1988 scientists introduced a new assessment method, which was based on conducting a census of snow crab abundance using an annual trawl survey. While the method has been significantly refined over the years, it still adheres to the same rigorous scientific protocols. Here is how it works.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952241">Following the close of the fishery each year, a crew of scientists travels to a series of 300 sites in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The sites are chosen carefully, and samples are gathered from all four areas where commercial fishers harvest snow crab. Each snow crab is accurately measured and counted and returned to the sea.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952242">The scientists aim to measure the relative abundance of various categories of crab. For example, it is important to know the number of mature females, which are not retained in the commercial fishery, as well as the commercial-sized and undersized males. This information enables researchers to estimate the current number of commercial-sized males, those with a carapace size of at least 95 millimetres, and it also enables researchers to predict the number of crabs expected to mature and recruit to the fishery in the next few years.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952243">All of this data is then subjected to sophisticated analysis using geo-statistical methods. This analysis enables scientists to estimate, in a relatively accurate manner, not only the overall size of crab stocks, but also how the stock is likely to change in the short term.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952244">Tracking of annual fluctuations in snow crab stocks is crucial for two reasons: one, because the estimates from this year influence decisions about catch quotas for future years and, two, because snow crab populations tend to fluctuate according to a relatively predictable cycle.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="21" Mn="50">(2150)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1952245">The reasons for this regular fluctuation are not completely understood, although each cycle tends to last approximately 10 years.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952246">The 2005 fishery marked the peak of the most recent cycle, and the stock has been in a declining phase since that time. Given this reality, many stakeholders were understandably concerned about the results of the latest sampling.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952247">This year, as is always the case, data from the trawl survey along with the analysis were subject to a science peer review. In February stakeholders of a number of groups participated in this peer review, and DFO scientists and fisheries management officials were joined by their counterparts from the provinces, the fishing industry and first nations communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952248">Scientific experts in the field of crustacean stock assessment from within and outside DFO were also invited. During the last peer review, an expert from the United States National Marine Fisheries Service participated.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952249">The review confirmed what many already suspected, that the stock is still in its declining phase. The commercial biomass of snow crab in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence was estimated at 26,100 tonnes for the 2010 fishing season. This represents a 46% decline from the figure for the 2009 fishery. The review also indicated that the stock is not expected to start its increase before 2012.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952250">Although these facts may be unwelcome, they must not be ignored. Five years ago, during the peak of the cycle, the estimated biomass exceeded 84,000 tonnes and the 2005 quota for the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence was set at 36,100 tonnes. Each year since then, both the biomass levels and the annual quota have fallen gradually. Last year the estimated biomass was 48,000 tonnes and the quota was set at 20,900 tonnes. Anyone familiar with the snow crab fishery had every reason to expect a further reduction this year.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952251">The sampling, analysis and review processes are all reliable and sound. The methodology is well established, credible and dependable. The analytical models are compliant to scientific standards for correlating resources and geography.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952252">For more than 20 years, Fisheries and Oceans Canada has relied on these estimates to set appropriate quotas. Fisheries management groups around the world follow similar processes.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952253">The same information is used for much more than setting catch limits. Stakeholders rely on the data to develop and implement their own fishing strategies. Many commercial fishing groups, for instance, use the data to determine how much time and effort they should invest in crab harvesting in a given season and which areas they should target.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952254">Sharing data is the essence of modern science. Science is increasingly at the centre of fisheries management not only in Canada but also around the world. The reason for this is simple. Basing management decisions on scientific data offers the best way to conserve the ocean's renewable resources in an era of rising demand for those same resources. In our quest for sustainable fisheries, science remains our best ally.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952255">The guiding principle of sustainable fisheries management is caution. The precautionary approach, as it is called, acknowledges that while our understanding of fisheries and ocean habitats is limited, the consequences of long-term overfishing are all too familiar: the collapse of fish stocks and crises in coastal communities have resulted.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952256">The truth is that science offers the best hope for understanding the world we live in and for achieving a sustainable snow crab fishery now and well into the future.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

He can do that.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952262">We just had department officials before the committee answering questions pertaining to the estimates, so those numbers are all publicly available. I do not have them off the top of my head. I do remember, however, in the committee that there were not very many questions from the opposition members directed at the officials regarding scientific spending. I can only assume, therefore, that the members of the opposition are satisfied with the money that is spent on the fishery.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952263">I do not quite understand what he is asking so far as the lobster fishery is concerned because it is a different fishery altogether. We have seen a change in the science when it comes to the escape mechanism in traps and so on. These things were actually rejected when science was put forward saying to the fishing community that they needed to increase the minimum size.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952264">It is no different than when I was a fisheries technician. We looked at slot sizes for walleye. I worked for several years on a walleye minimum size experiment. We collected the information. We tagged walleye. Doing a market capture experiment is the way we would estimate the biomass. With that experiment we would run into a lot of frustration with anglers and we would run into frustration with commercial fishermen.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952265">Years after this decisive action was taken as a result of the information we gathered, we have much more productive fisheries now in Alberta. We have much larger fish. We protected the reproductive stock.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952266">That is what we have done with the lobster as well. We have increased the carapace sizes in the various lobster fishing areas to make sure that the right size lobster is being harvested, that there is enough biomass there to reproduce. The same thing needs to happen with the crab fishery as well. We need to have enough females there to ensure that the stocks can continue on in the future.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952267">We have seen a decline. It seems completely normal to me. The year 2005 was the peak year and on a 10-year cycle that would mean that we are about halfway through the very bottom of the trough. It is not expected that we are going to come up, as I said in my speech, until 2012, which means that a competent minister, such as the <Affiliation DbId="128709" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries and Oceans</Affiliation> of this government, has to take the measures that are appropriate for conserving the fish stocks for the future.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

She basically upheld a decision by the former Liberal government, recognizing the legitimate place of new entrants into the fishery. She said that the new entrants would be guaranteed a stable position within the snow crab fishery in the southern gulf not only for this year but for five years straight right up until 2014.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952270">From our side that seems like a very responsible position to take. We applaud her for it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952271">I would like to ask the member, should that principle also apply with other fisheries as well? There has been some suggestion in the northern shrimp fishery that the minister may actually turn herself around in this and apply a last-in first-out principle instead of actually saying that we will institute a fair increase, fair decrease principle in terms of allocations.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952272">There is some concern in the industry that the minister may in that instance choose a last-in first-out instead of using the model that she used for the southern Gulf of Saint Lawrence crab fishery, the model used for her own constituents, which is regardless of the fisher's date of entry into the fishery, there is still a place and the fisher will still share a proportionate share based on the previous percentage of the quota.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I want to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="128675" Type="2">Humber—St. Barbe—Baie Verte</Affiliation> for bringing this matter forward for debate. I do appreciate that the <Affiliation DbId="128709" Type="4">Minister of Fisheries and Oceans</Affiliation> and other members of government are here to participate and to listen to the remarks made by hon. members here tonight.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952286">I realize that we are talking particularly about the big changes in the total allowable catch, in the southern gulf in particular and that region, but I want to talk for a moment about other aspects of the problems in the snow crab industry and the fishing industry generally, particularly in Newfoundland and Labrador, where there is not, in some of the other areas, such a big change in the total allowable catch, but despite that, there is a significant problem and a significant crisis.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952287">I am a little disturbed to hear the member for <Affiliation DbId="128820" Type="2">Wetaskiwin</Affiliation> refer to the annual crisis in the east coast fisheries, partly because he is right. We have had a series of crises in the east coast fisheries. It is not the fault of the people who are in the fishery and it is not because of the fact that the Fisheries Act was first introduced in 1867. The way the member talks, one would not know that there was never an amendment made to the Fisheries Act since 1867 and that somehow that means that not only does it have to be changed, but changed in the way that the government proposed it be changed the last time around. It is no trouble having a review of legislation, but it depends what one wants to do with it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952288"> I want to talk about the fact that what has been causing the crisis in the last couple of years in the east coast fishery, particularly in Newfoundland and Labrador, is a result of the recession that has been taking place, the one that the government denied in the first instance and then claimed to have solved a couple of months later. The fact of the matter is that regardless of what is happening in Canada, and we are seeming to have some turning of the corner here, the reality is that the products that we are talking about, crab, lobster and some high end fish, are really products that are sold in the worldwide market, principally in the United States, Europe and Japan. </ParaText><ParaText id="1952289">What do we see? We see two things.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952290"> First, we have fish being purchased mostly in restaurants, a product that is based on the disposable income of people going to restaurants, and when we see the guts taken out of the incomes of Americans, for example, they are still suffering perhaps worse than many Canadians are, but they are the ones upon whom we depend to actually go and buy this product.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952291">The second thing that we see happening is the devaluation by Canadian standards, and we call it a rise in the Canadian dollar but it was actually a devaluation of the U.S. currency, the devaluation of the British pound, the Danish krone, the Japanese yen and the Euro, all devalued in comparison with the Canadian dollar. What does that do? That significantly reduces the incomes of Canadian fishers and subsequently plant workers because the whole market depends upon them.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952292">The crisis that we have is the result of the economic downturn in this particular instance, and the depreciation of other currencies compared to the Canadian dollar, so a reduction of 20% in the market price is just as devastating to them as a reduction in the total allowable catch.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952293">I know the previous speaker is from <Affiliation DbId="128820" Type="2">Wetaskiwin</Affiliation>. I was in this House before, 20 years ago, when there used to be an awful lot of debate about the family farm out west and the need to protect the family farm. We do not hear much about that anymore because maybe so many family farms are actually gone and consolidated into larger farms and ranches, and the industrialization of farming out west, but that was a major topic. </ParaText><ParaText id="1952294">It was in fact a long-standing role of the Government of Canada to support farmers with programs when there were droughts, when the prices were low, and when there were significant downturns in the economics of the family farm as a result of either natural or market pressures. The farmers could look to and did look to the Government of Canada for support in those kinds of circumstances.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952295">I do not think we have really seen that to the same extent in the east coast fishery. The treatment seems to be a little different, and perhaps the minister would like to comment on that during the questions and comments period.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="22" Mn="10">(2210)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1952296">We have occasional programs, the kind of programs that the minister is talking about in terms of the lobster fishery. It is not direct support for the people engaged in the industry. We have not used the kind of creativity that is needed to support the industry. </ParaText><ParaText id="1952297">We have seen examples in major disasters, and I would refer to the cod moratorium in Newfoundland in 1992 as a major disaster, where there was a government response in those days. We are not talking about the same kind of devastating circumstances that came with the cod moratorium. Part of the issue had to do with the science at the time, and part of it had to do with overfishing, not only by foreigners, but also by Canadian fleets. There was a significant response by the Government of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952298">We still think the Government of Canada has a role to play in trying to mitigate against the situation that fishers are facing in the whole of the Atlantic these days because of the recession. We could talk about the infrastructure program. Obviously there are some benefits to communities if there is a small craft harbours program or an infrastructure program for roads or other things. That does not directly engage fishermen in the activity, but it provides some economic activity in the communities. We do need some significant support in these particular circumstances.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952299">We are not satisfied that the government and the minister have aided the industry enough during these difficult economic times. We have seen a major dent in the industry as a result of the recession. We know from our own experience, but also obviously market studies have shown that given the economic recession, people are dealing with significantly tighter household budgets. Disposable income is down. Crab and lobster and other products are seen as a luxury. Eating out at restaurants is seen as a luxury that many families cannot afford. We have that effect of the recession in particular in the areas of the fishery and there needs to be some special programs to deal with that. I understand the macro programs, the economic stimulation generally, but what about programs that directly support this? </ParaText><ParaText id="1952300">While other speakers have talked about the retirement of licences and things like that, there has been long-standing from the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, along with the fishermen's union, proposals to engage in the program to help older workers leave the industry, leave the fishery and leave the fish plant industry with dignity. The Government of Canada has so far refused, despite repeated requests by the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador and the fishermen's union in Newfoundland to participate in this program. The Government of Canada has declined to do that. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952301">These are some examples of the lack of sufficient support from the Government of Canada for fishers in Atlantic Canada, wherever they may be. </ParaText><ParaText id="1952302">We have heard from the member for <Affiliation DbId="128175" Type="2">Beauséjour</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="128675" Type="2">Humber—St. Barbe—Baie Verte</Affiliation> about the inadequacies of the lobster program. I recognize it was a program in which some effort was made, and perhaps as one member suggested, the minister valiantly fought with members in cabinet and tried to get more money from the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> and failed. I do not blame the minister totally for this, but her government obviously has to take responsibility for the failure to provide enough support and enough new programs aimed specifically at helping the people who are suffering as a result of this economic downturn.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952303">We have seen it in the auto industry. We have seen it in the forestry industry. As one member said, we did have specific programs for the forestry industry. Where are the specific programs that are going to help with this particular problem that we are seeing all across Newfoundland and Labrador in the existing crisis in the fishery? It is a market crisis. It is a recession crisis. It is directly related to that. We have seen great difficulties in even getting the fishery industry going this year because of negotiation problems particularly related to the market price of fish.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952304">As I say, it is a problem not simply of the reduction in total allowable catch, but that obviously does great harm to the fishing incomes in much of the southern gulf and other areas affected by the catch, but also the reduction in market price and the consequent significant damage to the fishery in Newfoundland and Labrador.</ParaText>

Gail Shea (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1952305">Mr. Chair, the member talked about the recession being responsible for where we are now, but what we have been discussing all evening is a reduction in quota. I would have to say that the economic downturn certainly would not have caused the crab to disappear. However, we have to deal with the disappearance.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952306">He talked about different federal government programs to assist the fishery. Although marketing is primarily a function of the industry, there is marketing assistance through CFIA to market different products.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952307">There is one initiative we have brought forward. I will use the lobster industry as an example. What has happened in the lobster industry is that for the most part the internal competition, I believe, kept prices depressed. It was not a highly organized operation. With assistance from the federal government and some of the provinces, the lobster council is being formed in an effort to have the entire industry work together so it can maximize returns to the fishers and the industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952308">This is going to take a tremendous effort on everyone's part because it is not something that has worked very well in the past. It seems that the industry is very much dog eat dog and who can get to the top of the pile first and the fishers are suffering because of that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952309">History shows that fishers have done fair to good. When markets were good and there was an abundance of fish, fishers made a decent living. Unfortunately, now we are in a situation where the markets are depressed and abundance is down at the same time. It is a double whammy for fishers and it is going to be a very difficult year. That being said, it is still not a reason to ignore science because science is what will take us into the next century.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952310">Something we have done in Newfoundland and Labrador is to allow for a buddy-up system, which would allow enterprises to combine. Over the last number of years we have seen the combining of over 200 enterprises. We have actually removed over 200 licences from the water, so there has been some good news in the fishery.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952311">In my mind, the most significant achievement this government has made to assist the fishery has been to extend the capital gains exemptions to fishers.

It reflects the capital gains exemption for farmers and recognizes that there is an intergenerational change in fishing enterprises similar to farmers. It was long overdue, I have to say, and I congratulate the government for doing that.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952313">The fact that such a program exists recognizes there is some significant capital to be passed on from one generation to another, and that is a good thing. That recognizes there is significant value in a fishing enterprise. The fisheries of old talked about the poor fishermen. We actually have some very well to do fishermen who have enterprises to pass on. They should not be penalized by a capital gains tax. That is a positive thing.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952314">To get back to some of the support for marketing, that is not a bad thing, but better arrangements for marketing and better marketing ability does not solve the price problem in the short term. We have had a significant drop in price, as much as 20%. That is significant and marketing support is not going to fix that right now. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952315">We can change co-operation marketing or, as suggested, internal competition problems that need to be fixed. These are things the government is working on and things that other governments have worked on in the past.

Gerry Byrne (Humber—St. Barbe—Baie Verte, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1952316">Mr. Chair, the member captured a lot of the hope, but as well, all of the frustrations in Newfoundland and Labrador and in eastern Canada about where the fishery is going. I think what is being met here is a sense that we need some direction and we need a sense of leadership. The leadership is coming from within the fishing communities but we are not necessarily seeing it from within the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952317">One of the problems with the buddying up system, to which the minister just referred, is that the department does not actually believe in it. I had an opportunity in the standing committee recently to question the assistant deputy minister, Dave Bevan, about whether the department was committed to continuing with the buddying up system. His reply was that the department was not because it did not contribute to rationalization but contributes to people staying in the fishery. </ParaText><ParaText id="1952318">What is wrong with that? I fail to understand why we cannot do things to support our fishers in making a viable industry out of this. Buddying up does not take any more fish out of the water. It is the same as allowing new entrants into a fishery does not take any more fish out of the water if they are simply dividing an existing quota and dividing it more fairly.</ParaText>

Is there a certain importance, a certain relevance to consistency in the decision-making process? I stood here tonight and said that the minister had made a good decision by making the new entrants to the southern gulf fishery feel very stable and comfortable in the fact that they would have a place in that fishery for many years to come. </ParaText><ParaText id="1952321">I then asked if it was the right thing to do the same for those involved in the northern shrimp fishery or should those who are relatively recent new entrants into the fishery feel very insecure.

That, to me, creates a problem. </ParaText><ParaText id="1952322">Does the member for <Affiliation DbId="128291" Type="2">St. John's East</Affiliation> believe it is important to have consistency in the management of our Canadian fisheries?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

What is important for fishermen for the long term, especially when they are investing heavily in enterprise, is stability. We talked about the capital gains tax exemption, for example. That is great as long as they do not lose their boat because of the costs of gasoline and all the expenses that go into it. If the market price is so low or the total allowable catch is so low that they cannot make it and they lose your boat, the capital gains tax exemption will not help them. It is a good thing but we need stability and part of stability is depending on the Government of Canada playing a role in ensuring fishers are capable of having a stable income over time.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952324">There are variations, obviously, from year to year. We are not expecting everything to be exact. However, part of stability depends on consistency of government, on leadership from government and on knowing that when times are particularly tough for reasons beyond the control of fishers and plant workers that there will be assistance available so they can stay in the fishery and be there the next year or the year after when that market comes back. That does involve the kind of commitment that we have not seen or have seen in bits and pieces from time to time, programs that are designed for one thing trying to shoehorn into something else. What is needed is directed programs to support the fishing industry.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Their groundfish licence is on a 35-foot boat and because they cannot afford two boats, they also have to fish lobster on that boat. They fish 150 kilometres offshore. The previous government would not change that act. We cannot change it without their support.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1952329">However, that is not really the point. I want to finish on Tim Rhyno's licence. His name has been brought up a couple of times in the House by members in absolutely nothing less than a drive-by smear. He owns his licence legally, morally and ethically. The reality is the story has never been told.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952330">Fist, two people did the science fishery. Tim Rhyno was one. The other person got a licence. Second, there were 17 licences granted in 2003. The first person got his licence. The second licence was put off until 2004. That was Tim Rhyno's licence. What happened to that licence? The minister of fisheries at the time, Minister Thibeault, granted the first person a licence and told Mr. Rhyno, in writing, that he would get his licence the following year.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952331">The following year came and the following year went. Somewhere or another on the other side of the House in the Liberal Party, there was political interference on that licence and he was not granted it. I do not know exactly who interfered, but I have my suspicions. I think we can take a look at the people who have been asking the questions.</ParaText>

Mr. Rhyno won the appeal, yet again, it was recommended by the minister that the licence not be allowed. My point is simple. The individual has been used unfairly. He has asked to come to committee. The committee asked for him to come and then withdrew its request.</ParaText><ParaText id="1952333">I suggest the committee bring Mr. Rhyno to committee, not in a kangaroo court in Sydney or any other place, but in Ottawa—</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
