Ralph Goodale</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1570316">Mr. Speaker, a number of serious issues have come to the floor of this House since the sitting of Parliament, which apparently will end today, first began with the 2009 federal budget in January.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570317"> Four of the most important of those issues, the ones that have dominated Canadians' attention for the past several weeks, are: first, the unfairnesses in the employment insurance system, especially, current eligibility rules, during a time of deepening recess; second, the progress, or the lack of progress, in getting infrastructure investments actually out the door and up and running; third, the exploding federal deficit, with no clear plan yet apparent to deal with it; and, fourth, the recent failure in Canada's ability to produce medical isotopes, causing a worldwide crisis in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, heart disease and many other serious health conditions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570318">These were the four issues that were specifically raised by the <Affiliation DbId="129314" Type="96">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation># this past Monday as matters requiring explicit attention this week from the Government of Canada before Parliament could allow the government's estimates to be approved today.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570319">With respect to employment insurance, there are two key problems that had to be addressed. One was fairness to the unemployed and regional equity across the country at a time when Canadians are facing a worsening economy. We are not living in the 1990s when Canada was coming out of a recession, when the economy began generating 3.5 million net new jobs, and Canadians enjoyed the start of the most protracted growth spurt since World War II.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570320">The circumstances of 2008-09, sadly, are the opposite, and the old rules are, unfairly, leaving too many Canadians out.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570321">That point about fairness was made not only by us in the official opposition but also by Premiers McGuinty of Ontario, Campbell of British Columbia, Stelmach of Alberta and Wall of Saskatchewan, as well as, incidentally, the Conservative Party in Ontario, including the spouse of the federal <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570322">With respect to effectiveness and affordability, without any premium increases, I would hasten to add, independent think tanks like the Conference Board of Canada, the Toronto Dominion Bank, the C.D. Howe Institute and others, agreed with the principle that were we arguing for. If we provide better access to EI benefits for the unemployed during a recession, we will increase their disposable incomes and, therefore, their purchasing power, and all of those benefits will be pumped right back into the economy almost immediately as those jobless Canadians buy the necessities of life for their families. Those benefits, therefore, become not a cost but an immediate form of economic stimulus; perhaps more effective than anything else that the government has announced.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570323">Until Monday of this week, the government denied all of this about employment insurance. It claimed that it had already fixed the system and there was really nothing left to do. However, now, as of this week, that view has changed. The government now agrees there is an EI eligibility problem. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has confirmed that the current rules in a recession “don't make a lot of sense”, to use his own words.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570324">So, we now have a process to at least try to fix that problem, as well as, perhaps, some others related to employment insurance. That is progress. That is better than where the problem stood on Monday.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570325">With respect to infrastructure programs to get shovels in the ground and jobs created in this construction season, the problem has been that there have been a lot of announcements and re-announcements of many projects over and over again, but so far, nearly a third of the way through the current construction season, very few tangible results have actually been obtained. It has been a lot of sizzle but very little steak. Big hat, no cattle. And that view has been shared emphatically by many mayors in municipalities across the country who have been waiting for some action.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="09" Mn="10">(0910)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1570326">The <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> said in his budget in January that the first 120 days following his budget would be the most critical in getting stimulus flowing this summer, but those 120 days passed three weeks ago, at a time when the Federation of Canadian Municipalities was reporting a 96% shortfall in the government's actual delivery on what it had promised. </ParaText><ParaText id="1570327">All of the PR campaigns aside, Canadians need to know what money was actually spent, not promised, not announced, not allocated, not advertised but actually spent on which projects, creating how many real jobs in those first 120 days. We now have a way to find that out faster than would otherwise have been the case.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570328">With respect to the deficit, we know this. The government has been erratic and inaccurate in providing any reliable information. Last fall the government was telling Canadians that a recession was unlikely and that there would be emphatically no deficit. In November, it claimed four more surplus budgets. In January, that had flipped around completely to a projection of two years of deficits, $34 billion this year and $30 billion next year. In February, March and April it told us that was still completely accurate information. It was still “on track”, it said.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570329">However, in May we learned the red ink for this year will not be $34 billion but $50 billion, a 48% increase. Deficits will follow not for two years but for at least five years and the cumulative damage will be something worse than $170 billion in new debt. </ParaText><ParaText id="1570330">Worse still, Conservative deficit financing began not because of but before there was a recession. It destroyed Canada's fiscal security during good times long before the trouble hit with a vengeance last fall. There is to date little evidence that the spending that has been announced is having any constructive effect and there is no apparent plan, other than wishful thinking, to deal with the new mortgage that is being placed on the future of our children.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570331">Because of the events of this week, the government will be obliged to be more forthcoming with Canadians about the actual debt and deficit situation and the government's plan to deal with it. It will also be required to produce and implement a plan to deal with the crisis in medical isotopes. Confusing snippets of information will not suffice. Neither will it be sufficient to try to pass the buck. </ParaText><ParaText id="1570332">The government must shoulder the responsibility that comes from being in power for more than three and a half years. It inherited nuclear facilities that were in fact duly licensed. It, itself, renewed those licences. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570333">There was no unplanned disruption in the flow of isotopes during the previous years of Liberal government. Neither was there any disruption during the Mulroney years before that, as far as anyone can remember. However, there have been two serious failures in the last 18 months. </ParaText><ParaText id="1570334">It is time to stop the spin, stop the excuses and just produce a plan to tell worried Canadians how this crisis is going to be fixed going forward. That is what matters. That is what patients waiting for cancer treatments want to know. On Monday, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> finally said he would comply and produce that plan.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570335">Those are the four key issues. The vehicle for achieving some progress on them is the motion that we are considering this morning. If this motion is adopted, the estimates will pass, the House will adjourn today for the normal summer period, we will return one week earlier in September, and our sittings will avoid any direct conflict with the G20. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570336">The government will prepare an extra probationary report on the economy, the fiscal situation and the fight against the recession. The report will provide details about infrastructure spending and the deficit, among other things. It will coincide with the advice that will be coming from a working group of MPs and others on how to fix EI eligibility. Shortly thereafter, there will be a vote scheduled in the House to test the government's performance and further opposition days for all parties will be scheduled in an even-handed manner through the fall and into December.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570337">There is some progress on the four important issues and there is enhanced accountability in a minority Parliament. For these reasons, this motion should be passed today.</ParaText>

As is the custom with the member for <Affiliation DbId="128559" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation>, his speech was basically another example of his propensity to revise history. </ParaText><ParaText id="1570339">We have heard many things from the member for <Affiliation DbId="128559" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation> in relation to the four main points the leader of the official opposition had leading up to the meetings between the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Leader of the Opposition. However, the official opposition House leader, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128559" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation>, fails to mention that basically none of the four points the official opposition leader felt were paramount to be answered prior to his decision on whether to force a spring election were really dealt with.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570340">The resolve that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the leader of the official opposition had at the end of their meetings, while very encouraging and beneficial to all Canadians since they resulted in no election call, did not really address the points that the leader of the official opposition had going into those meetings.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570341">I will give one clear example. For weeks and weeks we heard the Leader of the Opposition and many members of his party say that the main reform to EI must be a threshold of 360 hours across the country. There was no mention of that. There was no agreement to that when the agreement was finally reached between the two leaders.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570342">I would ask the official opposition House leader why he did a 180 on the 360? If that was the hill the Liberals were going to die on, why was this not agreed upon, or even raised, in the meeting between the leader of the official opposition and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Goodale" id="2849002"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78924" Type="2">Hon. Ralph Goodale</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1570343">Mr. Speaker, obviously I was not in the meeting, and neither was the hon. gentleman across the way, so perhaps we should both be a bit careful about saying what was or was not discussed in that meeting. The fact is that the topic of eligibility for unemployment insurance was expressly a part of the discussion. Both of the leaders have said that. They both agreed on a process by which to address that issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570344">It is significant that before that meeting the government denied that there was any problem with eligibility for employment insurance. It said that apart from its last election campaign promise, which had to do with parental leave for the self-employed, everything else had been addressed by what the government had done with respect to the five weeks of additional benefits and that there was no point even discussing EI eligibility.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570345">As it turns out, in his news conference following the meeting with the Leader of the Opposition, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said he agreed there were inequities in the rules with respect to eligibility and that he was prepared to make a good faith effort to try to address those with the Leader of the Opposition. Let us hope the process works, because that would be beneficial for unemployed people in this country.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Charlton" id="2849005"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128220" Type="2">Ms. Chris Charlton (Hamilton Mountain, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1570346">Mr. Speaker, I am fascinated by the debate this morning, particularly the exchange between the Conservative member and the member for <Affiliation DbId="128559" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation>. There seems to be the first crack in this new coalition government. I think Canadians will watch what unfolds with great interest.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570347">The question I want to ask this morning is also about EI. It pertains to the so-called blue ribbon panel. I thought this might be interesting, that there might be representatives from the CLC appointed to this panel, that there may be experts on the worker and employer sides who deal with employment insurance every single day.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570348">What do we get? We get a panel of Liberals and Conservatives, two MPs from each party and a political staffer. I am not sure why that is necessary, because frankly all the MPs in this House have already voted on EI.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570349"> We already know what this House has decided should happen on EI. The NDP motion on EI passed by a majority vote. Canadians are simply waiting for its implementation. They do not need more study. One and half million Canadians are unemployed. They need action, not more study.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="09" Mn="20">(0920)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Goodale" id="2849008"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78924" Type="2">Hon. Ralph Goodale</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1570350">Mr. Speaker, I am happy to say that the discussions this week have actually broken the logjam and a process is now in place that can lead to better results for unemployed Canadians across the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570351">I am encouraged by the remarks of the representative of the NDP, because it sounds like she would like to participate in the process. Hopefully there is a broad consensus across the country that can be arrived at.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570352">In terms of this working group, it will be able to reach out beyond its membership to receive good advice from wherever that may come.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Hill" id="2849013"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="129425" Type="4">Hon. Jay Hill (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1570353">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to speak to the opposition day motion moved by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128559" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation>, the Liberal House leader.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570354">The motion recognizes the role of the House in ensuring government accountability. As we know, that is the primary function of Parliament in our Westminster system. </ParaText><ParaText id="1570355">More specifically, the motion at hand calls for three things: first, that the Standing Orders of the House be changed with respect to the scheduling of allotted days this fall; second, that the House calendar be altered to accommodate the G20 meetings in September; and third, that the government table an additional report on the implementation of the 2009 budget.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570356">I will touch on these three points very briefly, as it is the government's intention to support the motion. I will devote the remainder of my remarks to a more general discourse on the successful functioning of Parliament and my experiences of this past session.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570357">The opposition day motion provides for a change to the rules of Parliament with regard to how the government may allocate opposition days this fall. Since coming to office in 2006, as a general rule our government has always tried to evenly distribute the opposition days in the parliamentary calendar. In certain circumstances we recognize that legislative priorities can force a deviation from this practice. However, we do support the idea of amending the Standing Orders to ensure that this usual practice becomes a rule.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570358">The second provision of today's opposition day motion provides for a change to the House calendar for the fall of 2009. Under this provision the House would open a week earlier than currently scheduled and it would then adjourn for the week of September 21. This will enable the government to focus on the G20 meetings in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on September 24 and 25.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570359">The G20 is the chief forum for the world leaders, as a group, to address issues resulting from the global economic crisis, and Canada has played an active and important role in these discussions. At the fall G20 meetings, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and other world leaders will discuss progress in promoting economic recovery and they will consider new ways to address global economic and financial challenges.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570360">I think we can all agree that there is no more pressing issue before Parliament than dealing with the global economic downturn, which has caused personal hardship and job loss around the world. Unfortunately, as we all know, Canada has not been immune.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570361">Our legislative program of this past session has reflected that the economy is the number one issue for Canadians. As such, I am pleased to support a motion that permits the Government of Canada to give its undivided attention to the critical economic discussions that will be taking place at the G20 summit in September.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570362">The third provision of today's opposition motion requests that the government table an additional report on the implementation of the 2009 budget. In the face of global economic uncertainty, this government presented a budget in January with a comprehensive economic action plan to stimulate economic growth, restore confidence and support Canadians and their families during this global recession.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570363">This economic recovery program is unprecedented in our history, and it is working. Canada was the last group of seven country to enter recession and the International Monetary Fund expects that we will have the strongest recovery coming out of it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570364">The government has also taken unprecedented steps in reporting on our economic action plan. We tabled an initial budget report in March. A week ago we tabled a second budget report, which outlines how 80% of the measures in our economic action plan are already being implemented. This government welcomes the opportunity provided by today's opposition day motion to table a third budget report in September. In fact, we committed to such a report in our budget presentation earlier this past winter.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570365">The <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> announced at the time that he would be tabling an economic report in the fall. This being the case, I commend the official opposition for echoing the government's pre-existing intention and commitment to provide quarterly reports on the economy in and through the House to all Canadians. As we debate this today, I think it is important to remember that the government was already committed to providing that report in September.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570366">As all members in the House know, the last few weeks have not been easy in this place. In fact they have not been easy on Canadians from coast to coast to coast. During this time of economic challenge, Canadians did not want to hear about the possibility of an election. Canadians want us to continue to work to achieve results for them. They know we cannot afford an election, which would put Canada's economic recovery at risk, halt stimulus investment across the country and limit our ability to continue to implement our economic action plan for Canadians.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="09" Mn="25">(0925)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1570367">By avoiding an election, we have enabled the government to continue its course of doing everything possible to turn this global recession around on our own soil. The cooperation we have seen emerge over this week, spearheaded by our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, has not only avoided a costly and unwanted election but has clearly demonstrated to Canadians that their Parliament can work for them.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570368">Despite the partisan political drama played out during the daily 45 minutes of question period, Canadians may be surprised to know just how cooperative and productive this past session of Parliament has been. Since January, our government has worked with all opposition parties to advance many important bills that will help Canadian families. We have moved forward on our electoral commitments, and I am pleased that much more has been done.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570369">Since January, the government has introduced a total of 54 bills.

This work involves defending the interests of Quebeckers and of workers.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570398">In the spirit of defending the interests of the workers of Quebec, the Bloc Québécois is opposed to the motion introduced by the Liberal-Conservative coalition. Let us not kid ourselves; the motion before us is the result of the deals that took place over the past few days and weeks between the <Affiliation DbId="129314" Type="96">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. They simply want to ensure that the Conservative government's so-called economic action plan moves forward, and all the Liberals and the Leader of the Opposition got in return was a vague promise of EI reform and the creation of a working group, which we think is a sham. I will come back to this.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570399">Voting in favour of this motion would mean voting in favour of this new Liberal-Conservative coalition, and would mean voting in favour of the budget that the Bloc Québécois has already voted against because it did not address the current needs of workers and the unemployed, the needs of the sectors that are currently struggling—like the forestry and manufacturing sectors—or the needs of Quebec.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570400">Since we voted against the budget because it was not friendly to workers, Quebeckers or the unemployed, we will certainly not vote in favour of the motion being discussed today. We will not endorse the partisan manoeuvring that has been taking place over the past few hours and days. Therefore, the Bloc Québécois will vote against this motion.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570401">If the <Affiliation DbId="129314" Type="96">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had been responsible and had chosen to assist the people and to immediately respond to the needs of the unemployed, instead of trying to buy more time, we could have justified supporting this motion. However, this is absolutely not the case.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570402">Not only did we yet again denounce the Conservative so-called economic action plan because it does not meet the needs of the people and the sectors that are suffering because of the financial crisis and the economic crisis, but we have also proposed comprehensive plans twice in the past few months, plans that included a series of proposals to meet the current needs of the economy and the population. Each time, the government and the Prime Minister dismissed our proposals out of hand without even finding out what they were.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570403">Yesterday, the Prime Minister said that the Bloc Québécois always makes up its mind to vote against everything without even reading it. That is not at all true. I think it is important to note that, since the Bloc Québécois first arrived here in 1993, every time any bill or motion whatsoever was introduced, we considered whether it would be good for Quebec, good for people, good for workers and good for the unemployed. We did not hesitate to vote for any bill or motion that we found to be good, regardless of whether it came from the government or another opposition party.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570404">I would note that yesterday, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> misled the House about that. For example, we voted in favour of the Conservative government's first two budgets because we felt that they included enough transfers to Quebec to justify them even though they did not resolve the fiscal imbalance. I want to make that very clear.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570405">What the Prime Minister said yesterday is not at all what the Bloc Québécois has done over the years. The Prime Minister, however, has shown no interest in any suggestions from the Bloc Québécois, the New Democratic Party, or the other half of the Liberal-Conservative coalition. His refusal to consider anyone else's ideas is revealing.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="09" Mn="40">(0940)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1570406">When just a few weeks ago the <Affiliation DbId="129314" Type="96">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> said that an eligibility threshold of 360 hours was imperative and absolutely necessary, and that they were prepared to go into an election before the end of June if the government did not compromise on this, he was right.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570407">So how is it that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> announced this week that that was out of the question and that he would not change his mind in the least, that a 360-hour threshold was out of the question? </ParaText><ParaText id="1570408">The <Affiliation DbId="129314" Type="96">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>, however, instead of standing up for his principles, preferred to put the interests of his political party and his own interests ahead of those of the public and unemployed workers. That is completely unacceptable.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570409">Getting back to what we proposed, I would remind the House that the proposals we have brought forward are supported by a broad consensus in Quebec. Consider the motion passed by the Quebec National Assembly on January 15, 2009, setting out the demands of the Quebec National Assembly in five points. The four parties of the National Assembly, namely, the Quebec Liberal Party, the Parti Québécois, the Action démocratique du Québec and Québec solidaire, unanimously demanded several things from the federal government.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570410"> First, they called on the government to provide assistance to workers, communities and businesses affected by the economic slowdown. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570411">Second, they called on the government to provide financial support to sectors experiencing problems, particularly the manufacturing and forest sectors. The motion pointed out that the government was applying a double standard: very generous assistance, which we agree with, to the auto sector, located mainly in Ontario, and nothing—just crumbs and peanuts—for the forestry sector, which is very present in Quebec.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570412">The third thing the Quebec National Assembly was asking for was improvements to the employment insurance program. And again, we have seen absolutely nothing. We have a working group, but we know that it will produce precious little.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570413">The fourth demand of the National Assembly was that the federal government maintain the equalization program. As we know, in the most recent budget, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> unilaterally changed the equalization formula, which will deprive Quebec of $1 billion. The Conservatives wanted us to vote for that, even though the Quebec National Assembly was asking for something else altogether. Had we voted for it, the Bloc Québécois would have truly been flouting the mandate we have been given, and that is out of the question.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570414">The last thing was to say no to a Canada-wide securities commission. Here, I must mention the vote again, because it is a vote by the Liberal Party. The Conservatives, as we know, are obsessed with this issue, because the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> are nothing less than the puppets of Bay Street.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570415">The Liberals, thinking they were being clever, remained seated. They did not vote. But by abstaining in that case, they voted with the Conservatives. No one is fooled by their strategy. We are also well aware that the Liberals, who are centralists—and the history of the Liberal Party proves it—also want to create this sort of commission, which would concentrate the financial sector in Toronto at Montreal's expense. No one in Quebec is fooled. By remaining seated and abstaining, the Liberals voted with the Conservatives as part of this new Liberal-Conservative coalition and against the interests of Quebec, and we will not forget to point that out.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570416">I would also remind this House that on the issue of language of work, French, which is the common language in Quebec and the official language of the Quebec nation, the Liberal Party and the Conservatives voted against the bill I had introduced to require that federally regulated companies operating in Quebec be subject to the Charter of the French Language, Bill 101. Once again, the Liberals and the Conservatives voted against this bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570417">The motion that is before us seals the pact between the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party, a coalition that has two main objectives. It takes aim against the interests of Quebec, against the interests of workers and against the interests of the unemployed, by depriving them of assistance. </ParaText><ParaText id="1570418">I will conclude by saying that the best illustration this week of the hypocrisy of some members of this House was the statement made during question period by the member for <Affiliation DbId="128153" Type="2">Bourassa</Affiliation>, the Liberals' political lieutenant in Quebec. He got all dramatic and said that amendments absolutely had to be made before the summer, or else the unemployed would starve. Now, the <Affiliation DbId="129314" Type="96">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="128153" Type="2">Bourassa</Affiliation> have chosen to let workers and the unemployed starve.

First, because the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has already rejected the solution proposed by the opposition parties, the 360-hour threshold that was again brought forward by the Leader of the Opposition. He said that it was out of the question. That is the only tangible proposal made by the Liberals with regard to employment insurance.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570423">The only tangible proposal from the Prime Minister and the Conservative Party during the election campaign was providing access to parental leave to independent workers—the self-employed. That benefit already exists in Quebec. It is of absolutely no use to Quebec or to Quebec workers. Right from the beginning, we know that the only two tangible proposals on the table give nothing to Quebec.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570424">Beyond that, how can we have confidence in a working group with Liberals on it when they are at the root of the problem? I remind the House that the reform that made deep cuts to employment insurance—ransacked it, in fact—was carried out by Mr. Axworthy, a Liberal minister at the time. How can we trust them? As for the Conservatives, they have appointed a board whose only aim is to reduce premiums and ensure that the employment insurance system will never, ever be overhauled.

I can imagine viewers at home asking themselves, “What the heck is a supply day and what does it have to do with me?”. So I thought I would begin by trying to take a stab at answering both questions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570426">Tradition holds that Parliament does not grant supply, or the government's spending authority, until the opposition has had an opportunity to demonstrate why it should be refused. As a result, some days of debate are allocated to each opposition party and these are what we call supply days.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570427">In this session of Parliament, the NDP had three such days and it is worth remembering that they are assigned to demonstrate why supply should be refused, not why it should be granted. Our supply days did precisely that. In drafting each of the three motions that were debated on our allotted days, we were governed by whether the government's economic action plan adequately addressed the needs of hard-working families and seniors.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570428">In my riding of <Affiliation DbId="128220" Type="2">Hamilton Mountain</Affiliation> and indeed in constituencies right across this country, Canadians are profoundly worried about their jobs, their pensions and their ability to pay their bills. They were counting on the federal government to take bold and strategic steps. They were looking to their members of Parliament to have courage in the face of adversity and so our motions addressed those very fundamental concerns.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570429">I had the privilege of tabling a motion on comprehensive EI reform on behalf of our caucus. The second motion addressed credit card gouging and protecting Canadians from the abusive practices of credit card companies. The third motion dealt with pension reform, so that the very people who built our country can retire with the dignity and respect they deserve.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570430">I am proud to say that all three NDP motions were passed by a majority vote in the House of Commons. In that way, we used our supply days as they were intended. We made strong cases on three of the shortcomings in the government's own economic action plan and we took our opposition role in the House of Commons seriously. Yes, it is our job to oppose, but we also believe that we can only be an effective opposition if we also propose better alternatives.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570431">Fast forward to today. We are debating a Liberal supply day motion that does nothing but demonstrate why the government's spending authority should be granted. In fact, it might as well have been written by the government itself, oh wait, it partially was. It was the Conservative Party that first asked that the House not sit during the week of September 21 to accommodate meetings of the G20, yet here it is at the very heart of the Liberal supply day motion.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570432">To add insult to injury for Canadians, the entire motion deals with amendments to the Standing Orders. I would bet the vast majority of Canadians do not even know what Standing Orders are. They are simply the codified rules of procedure that govern the House. Debating these rules is the ultimate expression of insider baseball. Canadians do not care about amendments to the Standing Orders. That is not what they mean when they ask us to please make Parliament work. They want us to make Parliament work for them, not for us. It is about their jobs, not ours. It is about having their concerns addressed. That is why they sent us here.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570433">However, in their desperation to avoid a summer election, the Liberals put their needs ahead of the needs of working families. It is an absolute disgrace. Thankfully, the media are not letting them get away with it. David Akin wrote in his <I>Hill Times</I> blog that “NDP got billions, Libs got a working group”, cleverly reminding Canadians that when the NDP negotiated with the then minority government of Paul Martin in 2005, it turned $4.6 billion of corporate tax cuts into $1.6 billion for affordable housing, $1.5 billion for post-secondary education, $900 million for transit, $500 million for foreign aid, and $100 million for pension protection.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570434">In 2009 the Liberal leader from <Affiliation DbId="128315" Type="2">Etobicoke—Lakeshore</Affiliation> received a working group and an opposition day for supporting the minority government of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. After long hours at the negotiating table, the Liberal leader walked away with nothing of substance in exchange for his continued support of the Conservative government and its failed policies.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570435">Aside from changes to the Standing Orders, all he could manage was a “blue ribbon panel” on employment insurance with limited scope that will not report back until September. That panel is cold comfort to the 1.5 million unemployed Canadians dealing with a deeply flawed EI system. As for the panel being a blue ribbon group, Canadians will be shocked to learn that it is made up solely of politicians and political staff. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570436">However, politicians just passed an NDP motion on comprehensive EI reform in this very session of Parliament. It was endorsed by city councils and labour groups right across this country. We do not need more study. We need to start implementation and unemployed Canadians need that action now, not in September.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="09" Mn="50">(0950)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1570437">Instead, we get a panel that is half made up of Liberals, whose party in the mid-1990s was responsible for gutting EI in the first place, and who stole the $57 billion EI surplus from workers and used it to pay down the debt and deficit. The Conservative half of the panel includes the very cabinet minister who is on record stating that she is worried about EI becoming too lucrative.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570438">The creation of this panel has nothing to do with protecting workers during this economic downturn and has everything to do with protecting the political aspirations of the Liberal and Conservative parties. Canadians need and deserve so much better. It is not as though there are not plenty of issues to choose from. I have already mentioned pensions, immediate EI reform and an end to credit card gouging. However, what about health care, the issue that is consistently top of mind for all Canadians?</ParaText><ParaText id="1570439">There are three heart-wrenching words that no one ever wants to hear: “You have cancer”. However, for nearly 500 Canadians every single day, this diagnosis becomes a new fact of life. Historically, Canada has been a leader in easing that pain by producing medical isotopes used in the diagnosis and treatment of both cancer and heart disease. Now, that production is in peril. Thanks to government mismanagement and neglect, the reactor that produces these isotopes has shut down.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570440">Cancer tests across the country are being cancelled, leaving desperate Canadians in a state of limbo during the most difficult period of their lives. Yet, the Conservative government, like the Liberal one before it, continues to drop the ball. It is too busy vying for political gain and calling cancer “sexy”, even in the face of this life-threatening national health care crisis.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570441">Where was this issue in the so-called negotiations between the Liberal leader and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>? Despite initial bluster, the rhetoric dissolved without any demand for real action. Where was the demand for expedited job creation? Unemployment numbers have now reached 400,000 just since the last election.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570442">Despite a deficit that is now spiralling upward of $50 billion, money has still not reached local communities so that they can take advantage of this summer's construction season. The government says that 80% of the infrastructure money has been committed, but one cannot pave roads with press releases. The money needs to flow. Summer is here, but the living is still tough in far too many cities in Canada.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570443">I am having a bit of déjà vu here. Members will recall that the first time I spoke in the House at the beginning of the current Parliament, I pointed out that it was the economic crisis and the government's cavalier response to the fears of Canadians in its fiscal update last fall that precipitated the political crisis of confidence and ultimately the constitutional crisis that shut down this place for two months.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570444">Just when Canadians needed their government the most, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> shut the doors on Parliament and effectively said that his need to protect his job was more important than the need to protect the jobs, pensions and savings of hard-working Canadians. Now, a mere six months later, it is happening again.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570445">This time, the chief protagonist is the leader of the Liberal Party. He desperately wants to be prime minister, but he knows that he is not ready. He is having difficulty attracting credible candidates, his party's finances are not competitive, and he has still not been able to articulate what he stands for. Therefore, he has not differentiated himself from the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> we already have.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570446">Certainly, this week's events will have even more Canadians saying to each other that they cannot see the difference and asking each other if they can. He was desperate to avoid an election at any cost, but his obligation is not to himself. In fact, I would remind all members in the House that it is not all about us. On the contrary, it is not about us at all, or at least it should not be.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570447">We have the privileged opportunity to come to this chamber, not to fight for ourselves but to fight for our constituents. In these uncertain economic times, that means acting decisively to protect the vulnerable, safeguard today's jobs and create the jobs of tomorrow.

I have spoken to a number of her colleagues in the last few days who have told us that they wanted a deal made and that they did not want to go to an election. It is not just because they were not doing so well in the polls right now. It is because they knew that Canadians did not want to have an election.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570449">The bluster and hype that goes on here is a little hard to deal with on occasion. I understand that it is politics and in politics that is how things are, but she talks about the deal that we made so that we could do some work over the summer and perhaps come back with some EI proposals. She talked about some of the good ideas that the NDP brought forward. The Liberals supported a number of those in the House. As she said, they passed with a majority of the votes.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570450">However, what have they done for Canadians? They have added nothing. There is nothing for Canadians as a result of that. It has not left the House. How can she say that it does not make sense to do a little bit of work over the summer and see if we can come up with some proposals when all the hype and bluster here has done absolutely nothing? The government members have not listened. Should they have? Yes, but they have not.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570451">What have they added to the debate? We can pass things in Parliament. We can come to this place in Parliament, but we have to make a difference. In this Parliament, one can make a point or make a difference.

Does he remember who was just elected as premier in Nova Scotia? I could have sworn it was a majority NDP government. His concern about our polling number is a bit misplaced.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570453">With respect to EI, the member supported the motion that the NDP put forward. The motion on EI called for four specific things: get rid of the two-week waiting period; 360 hours to qualify for EI with no regional diversion in terms of eligibility and access to employment insurance; better benefits; and access to employment insurance by the self-employed. We do not need more study. He voted for that EI motion and we need it to be implemented. </ParaText><ParaText id="1570454">It is not negotiation when people walk away with absolutely nothing.

It allows us to hold the government to account, adjust the House calendar in the fall and a number of other issues, as well. It also allows us, as members of Parliament, to arrive home tonight or tomorrow and see our families, which will welcome us.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570461">Our constituents may not be as welcoming and they certainly would not have been delighted to see us knocking on their doors. I think people would have felt downright anger if we had been unable to do something productive so we could avoid an election in Canada. I know people never really want an election. They have more important things to do with their lives. We need to have them on occasion, but I think Canadians were right in this case. This was not the time to have an election.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570462">My colleagues and I arrived here on Monday and nobody knew exactly what would happen. We knew Canadians were watching. I think this week Parliament rose to the level of the people we represent. There are differences among all parties, and those continue. The government is not completely satisfied and the opposition is not completely satisfied, and I say that about all opposition parties. However, I believe significant concessions have been made in the national interest.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570463">I want to talk about employment insurance. EI is an issue that I have been involved with for some time now, ever since my appointment as critic for human resources two and a half years ago. To be frank, it was not an issue about which I had a lot of knowledge. I come from an area in Atlantic Canada. People often say that I am from Atlantic Canada, so EI is a big issue. In fact, in the riding of Dartmouth—Cole Harbour, people need the maximum number of hours to qualify for EI, which is 700 hours. Many other parts of Atlantic Canada have seasonal issues of unemployment and areas of high unemployment and the hours to qualify are different.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570464">In my view this is not a regional issue. It is a national issue. It may have regional implications, but this is a national issue of employment insurance. On taking my job, it became clear to me, from listening to stakeholder groups that represented workers and other social justice and business groups, that it was time for changes to EI.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570465">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128559" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation> has correctly outlined the differences between the mid-1990s and today. There are very significant differences in the economy. EI has to adjust to the economic circumstances. We are in a crisis. EI, as a major part of our social infrastructure, has to play an important role as we recover from this crisis.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570466">Over the last little while, particularly since the last election, EI has become a very significant issue to Canadians. There was nothing about employment insurance in the very partisan economic update. In fact, the Conservatives first denied there was a problem. This led to a showdown in the fall and toward Christmas. Then the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> shut down Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570467">The Liberals first raised the alarm bell. With increased unemployment, people were experiencing, for example, delays in obtaining their benefits, sometimes up to 40-plus days. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128549" Type="2">Madawaska—Restigouche</Affiliation> raised this issue in the House back in November. I think people in his constituency were waiting 55 to 60 days.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570468">On November 27, 2008, I asked a question of the <Affiliation DbId="128694" Type="4">Minister of Human Resources</Affiliation> about delays. She denied there was a problem. On December 19, I sent a letter to her, indicating we needed some action. Again, we did not get any indication that the government saw this as an issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570469">Three months went by with no response until she sent me a letter in which she apologized for the delay in responding to my letter. However, she still did not address the issue about wait times for EI. Eventually we saw $60 million that appeared to have been dedicated toward easing the backlog of EI applications.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570470">The other issue with respect to EI is this. Tens of thousands of Canadians have paid into EI but do not qualify. They paid into the plan and when they needed the help, it was not there. The Conservative government again failed to act for months, and as a result caused families to suffer.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570471">On each issue, the Liberals fought day in and day out during this session of Parliament, calling upon the government to take real action on employment insurance, but it did not. We nearly ended up with an election, but this week we were able to avert that. From our point of view, the good thing from that is the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has acknowledged it does not make sense to have 58 EI rates.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570472">If we look at the chart of employment insurance, it is incredibly complicated. People need a degree in mathematics just to figure out whether they qualify, based on the hours they have, the employment rate in their region, et cetera. It does not make any sense that people who live in Ottawa do not qualify for EI, but if they work in the same place but live in Gatineau, they do. It is the same thing in Moncton and Dieppe. People could working in the same plant and one person would qualify, the other would not. In my own riding of Dartmouth—Cole Harbour, one does not have to drive very far to see a very significant differentiation in terms of who qualifies for EI and who does not.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="05">(1005)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1570473">How do we fix it? We have seen private members' bills, studies and advocacy from a lot of people. The New Democrats and the Bloc Québécois have raised this in private members' bill for years, and I have supported them. I do not question their motivation on this, but I do question what has actually come out of it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570474"> The member for <Affiliation DbId="128220" Type="2">Hamilton Mountain</Affiliation> correctly talked about an opposition day motion she brought forward. The member for <Affiliation DbId="128407" Type="2">Welland</Affiliation> has brought forward a bill.

The Bloc member for <Affiliation DbId="128316" Type="2">Brome—Missisquoi</Affiliation> has a bill that passed the House and has to go to committee. We have supported these important bills. However, the problem is they have not helped one worker in the country. They have added up to nothing. It is inside baseball or inside Ottawa, so to speak.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570475">The fact is when we come to this place, we can either make a point or we can make a difference. Let us try to make a difference. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128638" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation> often speaks about this.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570476">We will all go home tonight or tomorrow and we will have the chance to do our work. We all know it is not a summer vacation. MPs work very hard in their ridings. When we have come through a hard session, as we have recently, we have a lot to make up in our constituencies. We take our work very seriously. Nobody gets everything they want, but Canadians do get a couple of things. They get a summer without an election and they also have an opportunity to make significant improvement in employment insurance.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570477">As a result of the discussions between the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="129314" Type="96">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation>, I now have a summer job that I did not apply for, but which I am happy to accept. I am happy to work with my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128273" Type="2">Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine</Affiliation>. I will work with the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, with the officials and with whomever I have to, because this is important work.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570478"> I will not stand here today and tell members that we will come to an agreement in September. It may well be that we cannot because we have certain principles. We have talked about 360 hours, and that has been maligned. I do not think it has even been a misunderstanding. There have been absolute deliberate mistruths spread about that 360-hour standard.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570479"> Right now people can get EI in many parts of the country for 420 hours. That is not a whole lot different from 360 hours. In fact, people cannot collect EI for a year anywhere in the country. The maximum was 45 weeks. With the extension of five weeks, it is now 50 weeks. Our proposal for the duration of the crisis, which I think makes a lot of sense, is people would be able to qualify for EI after 360 hours. They would still have a variable length of time in which they could collect it, starting at 19 weeks and going up to 50 weeks. A structural change to EI has to come.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570480">The self-employed have talked for years about the need to be involved. It is not a simple issue. How do we determine who actually is eligible as a self-employed person? Should it be voluntary or should it be mandatory? There are those who would say both.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570481">If we asked all Canadians who pay EI, “Would you like to pay EI?”, what we would have? Most people who think they might need it would pay for it. Those who did not think they would need it might not pay for it. That would be a normal thing. With the self-employed, it is a complicated issue, but it is time we tackled this. I think as a result of the restructuring, as an outcome of the crisis in economy, we will have more self-employed people. That is important. </ParaText><ParaText id="1570482">However, regional fairness is important. Any one of us, the 308 members of Parliament in the House, would have a hard time going to our constituents and saying to them, in a time of economic crisis, that they need 700 hours to qualify but somebody else needs 420. The regional rates have made sense in economies in the past, but right now Canadians are hurting. It is about fairness. It is about a national standard. It is about doing what is right for Canadians when they need help.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570483">Employment insurance is a very important piece of our social infrastructure. It is time to make it better. I certainly look forward to, and accept humbly, the opportunity to be a part of the task force. I hope we can make a difference for Canadians.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

That was the Liberal style of government with Jean Chrétien as Prime Minister and Paul Martin as Minister of Finance. When they got together in 1993 and decided to eliminate the deficit, they asked the minister at the time, Doug Young, to squeeze employment insurance by increasing premiums and cutting benefits. It was a tough job that Doug Young started and Liberal minister Axworthy finished. </ParaText><ParaText id="1570485">This week, we witnessed the creation of a Liberal-Conservative coalition. Because of the difficult economic situation, we are calling on the government to eliminate the two week waiting period and reduce the eligibility threshold to 360 hours.

The Bloc Québécois is not here just to defend Quebec's rights, but to defend the rights of all workers and the unemployed. While the Liberals were in power, they governed like Conservatives. Now we have a panel made up of Liberals and Conservatives.</ParaText>

We are in the midst of the most severe and widespread global recession in recent memory, a recession that all economists admit had no origins in Canada. As RBC Global Asset Management economist Patricia Croft observed, “This is not a made in Canada recession; this started outside of our borders”.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570501">Regardless, this global recession has and will continue to impact Canadians, an impact that has been as brutal as it has been swift. In mere months unemployment has jumped to its highest rate in over a decade. Hundreds of thousands of Canadians have lost their jobs so far this year. Behind each one of those job losses is a family facing harsh realities, sleepless nights and uncomfortable conversations around the kitchen table, conversations about paying the mortgage or the rent and perhaps even groceries. As TD chief economist Don Drummond bluntly declared, “This year will go down in the history books as one of the most difficult economic years for Canadians”.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570502">Our Conservative government has and will continue to recognize the economic challenges that we face. That is why we have tirelessly and aggressively worked to protect our economy. That is why we continue to work with our global partners on a global solution to a global recession. That is why we conducted the most comprehensive and open prebudget consultation process in Canadian history. That is why we tabled the earliest federal budget in history on January 27. That is why we made the difficult but necessary decision to run a short-term deficit.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570503">What we presented was more than a budget. It was an ambitious, 300-plus page economic action plan, a plan focused on providing timely, targeted and temporary stimulus to save and protect jobs today; all this while growing the Canadian economy for tomorrow. It is a plan that the IMF heralded as “large, timely and well-targeted fiscal stimulus, appropriately sized well above the fund's benchmark of 2% of GDP”.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570504">Indeed, our economic action plan received broad endorsement from provincial premiers, municipal leaders, business leaders, economists, public interest groups, and most important, this Parliament. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570505">What is more, since its January introduction, we have succeeded in helping Canadians by aggressively implementing our plan, first of all, by reducing taxes permanently, helping the unemployed through new training programs and an extended five weeks of EI, avoiding layoffs by enhancing the EI work sharing program, maintaining and creating jobs through massive infrastructure spending, improving infrastructure at colleges and universities, supporting research and technology, supporting industries and communities most affected by the global recession, improving access to and the affordability of financing for Canadian households and businesses. Most important of all, we have succeeded in doing all of this on a timely basis.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570506">Indeed, 80% of this fiscal year's economic action plan's initiatives are already being implemented. What does this mean for Canadians? It means in every region of Canada families and businesses are paying less tax. It means unemployed workers are receiving enhanced benefits as well as training. It means major job-creating projects are breaking ground. It means more Canadians are keeping more of their money in their own pockets where it belongs. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570507">Because of our tax cuts, such as raising the basic personal exemption and the ceiling on the lower and middle income tax brackets, little wonder on June 6 of this year Canadians celebrated tax freedom day three days earlier than last year and 19 days earlier than under the former Liberal government. It means more than 3,500 businesses across Canada have entered into an expanded EI work sharing program helping almost 130,000 employees, employees like the nearly 100 workers at the Michelin Canada plant in Waterville, Nova Scotia, where the plant has continued to operate under an EI work sharing program.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1570508">Our plan includes much more and we want Canadians to learn more about it. That is why we created a website, www.actionplan.gc.ca, that clearly lays out our plan's benefits for individuals, businesses and communities.

It is also helping threatened industries. </ParaText><ParaText id="1570562">Last week, I had the pleasure of announcing a number of infrastructure projects in the province of Manitoba. I was with the Premier of Manitoba, who is a New Democrat. I must say that he has been responsible in his approach to the recession. He has worked with the federal government to ensure that the stimulus money flows. In fact, he indicated this stimulus funding was working.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570563">For example, in Manitoba alone, last year there were 36,000 construction jobs. This year, there are 38,000 construction jobs, directly attributable to the stimulus funding that is going on through the programs of this government. I want to thank the premiers, like Premier Doer and others, who are in fact working with this government to ensure that this succeeds.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570564">There is virtually no area of our economy that this funding does not touch. It is being used to invest in the skills and knowledge of Canadians. For example, last month we introduced the knowledge infrastructure program, a two-year $2 billion economic stimulus measure to support infrastructure enhancements at Canadian post-secondary institutions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570565">In fact, I had the pleasure of being with Dr. Lloyd Axworthy, the president of the University of Winnipeg, who praised this government's initiatives in respect of the stimulus funding.

Dr. Axworthy and his staff are thankful for the initiative of our government to help the university move along with that $18 million grant provided to it, which was matched by the provincial government.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570566">Just this week our government announced $1 billion to support environmental improvements for the pulp and paper industry, not to mention all the funding for roads, bridges, recreational and community facilities. For instance, there is a bridge on a main road through the entire southern portion of the province of Manitoba. That bridge was virtually falling and, indeed, is still in danger of virtually falling into the Red River. The Liberals did absolutely nothing in that respect.</ParaText>

We are also seeing success for farmers, to help them in their work.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570569">I appreciate the support that the Liberals have given us to date.

							<ParaText id="1570586">As a consequence, today's deficit is far greater than it need be had these Conservatives managed prudently during good times.

If in a few months from now it turns out the minister was once again wrong by the same amount, then that alone is enough to give the country a slight deficit this year and a bigger deficit next year.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1570588">That was two budgets ago, and they paid no attention. Look where we are today.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570589">We have also spent a lot of time in this House and in committee warning that the government was wrong-headed in terms of the new employment insurance crown corporation, that it was not well equipped to handle a recession. On many occasions, I and many others stressed that the EI account needed to be balanced over the business cycle, not just over two years, in order to avoid massive swings in the premium rate, especially in the event of a recession. Actuaries from across the country all told them the same thing. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570590">As usual, the government paid no attention, and last November we saw how this played out. The government had to re-seize the rate-setting mechanism from the new EI corporation and hold it steady. It did, however, increase the maximum contribution for anyone earning more than the average industrial wage. Those employees and their employers had a payroll tax hike in the middle of a recession.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570591">The part that the Conservatives really do not like to talk about is the future EI tax increases that the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> has already booked into the fiscal framework beginning in 2011. Page 233 of the budget clearly says that not only has the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> already decided to increase these payroll taxes 18 months from now, it says he has already included the revenue from his future tax hike into the EI account's revenue stream.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570592"> So much for being a Conservative Party that does not like tax hikes.

I would say the one major act of imprudence committed by the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister </Affiliation> during those days is that he got rid of the $3 billion contingency reserve, which had been an insurance policy applied over many years by previous Liberal governments to avoid deficits. He simply yanked that off the table and we can see where we are today in terms of deficits.</ParaText><ParaText id="1570601">My second point is about the debt. The point is that we today are living in a world of historically extremely low interest rates, close to zero at the short end, up to just under 4% at the long end. Therefore, the great risk for Canadians and for future generations is that there will be a spike in interest rates. With the government having to borrow for refinancing purposes over $200 billion per year, imagine the impact on the deficit if there were a big spike in interest rates.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570602">A prudent <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister </Affiliation>, at this time of historically low interest rates and major borrowing requirements, would seek to lock in more of the debt at longer terms so as to reduce this risk of a huge impact on the deficit were there to be a spike in interest rates. However, I can tell the House, so far the finance minister's record on this subject is going in the wrong direction, the imprudent direction, because the debt of this nation has been coming shorter term rather than longer term because the borrowing is concentrated at the short ends and not at the long ends. </ParaText><ParaText id="1570603">What the finance minister for the second time is doing is engaging in imprudent behaviour. He is failing to take advantage of the historically very low interest rates to lock in a higher proportion of the national debt at the longer terms so as to reduce the risk of a huge impact on the deficit should interest rates spike in the future.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1570604">We know that the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister </Affiliation> has behaved imprudently on the contingency reserve in the past. We can still hope that he will exercise a modicum of prudence and move to a longer term structure of our debt so as to reduce the risk of interest rate spikes for current and future generations. So far, the budget talks of him moving in the opposite direction. Therefore, I am concerned for the sake of our children and our grandchildren that the minister is not managing our national debt in a prudent fashion.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

							<ParaText id="1571022">Mr. Speaker, a number of initiatives are currently underway to improve financial literacy for Canadians; however, our government believed it was time to better organize efforts. To that effect, budget 2009, presented to the House of Commons on January 27, 2009, committed $5 million over two years, 2009-10 and 2010-11, to establish an independent task force. 

</ParaText><ParaText id="1571023">This task force will make recommendations to the Minister of Finance on a cohesive national strategy on financial literacy, and include representatives of the business and education sectors, volunteer organizations, and academics, and will be supported by a federal secretariat. The task force is expected to be launched in the spring of 2009. 

</ParaText><ParaText id="1571024">With respect to how improving financial literacy will help Canadians, our government believes that financial literacy is an important life skill that empowers consumers to make the best financial decisions in their particular circumstances.  Increased financial literacy allows consumers to act knowledgeably and with confidence to look after their own best interest and achieve their personal and financial goals.  

</ParaText><ParaText id="1571025">Individuals like John Hope Bryant, founder, chairman and CEO of Operation HOPE, Inc. and vice-chairman of the United States President Barack Obama's Advisory Committee on Financial Literacy and Peter Nares, founder and executive director of Social and Enterprise Development Innovations, SEDI, have publicly echoed that sentiment and applauded our government’s initiatives in that regard, declaring that: “Financial literacy entails developing skill sets people will use every day to make better decisions … (the Conservative) government has taken some important steps in this direction. In 2007, (the) government mandated that the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada begin addressing financial literacy matters. Funding was provided in the subsequent federal budgets. However, in fiscal 2009, the Canadian government has the opportunity to grab hold of this issue as our major trading partners have done. The commitment to form an independent, multi-sector task force to develop a national strategy on financial literacy is the first step in a process that could help Canadians make better financial decisions. It could also help Canadians better weather the economic storms that will inevitably blow through the global economy from time to time”.

Of those plans, there were 351 defined benefit plans, 904 defined contribution plans and 95 combination plans.  These plans covered over 594,000 members, of which 391,000 were in a defined benefit plan, 104,000 in a defined contribution plan and 99,000 in a combination plan.  Total assets for these plans were $132 billion, with $109 billion in defined benefit plans, $4 billion in defined contribution plans and $19 billion in combination plans.  OSFI regulates approximately 7 percent of pension plans in Canada. The other 93 percent are under provincial regulation, representing 5.2 million members with total assets of $961 billion.  53 percent of federally regulated pension plan assets were invested in equities, 39 percent in debt instruments and 8 percent in diversified and other assets.</ParaText><ParaText id="1571032"> 

In April 2009, OSFI reported, www.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/app/DocRepository/1/eng/media/nr_esr_e.pdf,  that the average estimated solvency ratio for federally regulated defined benefit plans was 0.85 in December 2008. Estimated solvency ratios are determined by dividing a plan’s estimated assets by the plan’s estimated liabilities, using assumptions consistent with the plan being terminated.  OSFI continues to monitor the funding situation of plans carefully and is taking steps, where necessary, to protect the rights and interests of plan beneficiaries.

</ParaText><ParaText id="1571033">The government has taken action to better protect the pensions of working Canadians by making amendments to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act that will grant super priority status to outstanding employer and employee pension contributions in both bankruptcy and corporate restructuring.  This super-priority status became law in bankruptcy in July 2008.  
</ParaText><ParaText id="1571034">Given the present extraordinary circumstances affecting private pension plans, the Government took action in Budget 2009, presented to the House of Commons on January 27, 2009, and the 2008 Economic and Fiscal Statement by providing temporary solvency funding relief that will facilitate an orderly return to full funding while protecting the security of benefits.  The regulations implementing this temporary relief were pre-published in the Canada Gazette on April 4th.

						<ResponseContent>
							<ParaText id="1571047">Mr. Speaker, in response to a) and c) Financial support for travel to receive treatment benefits is authorized in the Veterans Health Care Regulations, VHCRs. The VHCRs include a deduction of $5.00 for each trip from the cost of taxi travel. However, the VHCRs also allow for $5.00 deduction to be waived whenever there is any reasonable concern that this deduction may negatively impact the client's ability to access needed treatment benefits. The deduction may be waived if the client's mobility or cognition is severely impaired, or it would seriously impede the client's ability to access treatment benefits.

</ParaText><ParaText id="1571048">The relevant policy was reviewed in 2007 and as a result, a policy statement was sent to the field in 2007 to clarify the intent of the policy and ensure staff were applying section 34.2, the regulatory authority to waive the deductible for aging veterans dealing with multiple and complex health needs who require frequent visits to treatment centres. The relevant policy allows for the full benefit of doubt given to the veteran and recognize that a deductible for those in lower income situations has the effect of creating a potential barrier to seeking needed medical care. 

</ParaText><ParaText id="1571049">In response to b) The department does not track information specific to deductions on the repayment of taxi fares. In 2007-2008, there were over 90,000 payments for taxi fares processed for a total of close to $1.9 million paid to veterans.

There is a very simple reason for this decision. The estimates are closely related to the entire budget tabled by the Conservative government and supported by the Liberals. As we said when the budget was passed and during debate on the budget, we realized that the budget was not good for Quebec, that it was bad for Quebec. That is why we will be voting against the estimates because the implementation of this budget deprives Quebec of significant means to ensure its development.</ParaText><ParaText id="1571075">A number of reasons justify what I have just said. We have realized that, contrary to the unanimous will expressed on a number of occasions in Quebec's National Assembly, the Conservative budget, once again supported by the Liberals, does not help Quebec at all in the way desired by the National Assembly of Quebec, which unanimously asked for certain measures.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1571076">On January 15, 2009, Quebec's National Assembly passed a unanimous motion calling for more help for workers, communities and businesses affected by the downturn, and for significant support for the manufacturing and forestry sectors, which are going through a particularly hard time.</ParaText><ParaText id="1571077">In that regard, the Conservative budget, which was recently increased, was completely unfair. In its budget, the party gave the auto sector nearly $4 billion, and has since increased that amount. Now the auto sector will be getting almost $10 billion.</ParaText><ParaText id="1571078">That same budget allocated just $270 million over three years to the forestry sector across Canada. But in every region of Quebec, forestry companies, paper mills, sawmills and softwood lumber companies are facing serious challenges, and thousands of people have lost their jobs. Yet the Conservative government gave us a budget that ignores them all.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1571079">Early this week, the government announced a new measure that Quebec is unanimously against. The government would have us believe that its new measure will solve a bunch of problems, but that is not true. It is not true because what the Conservatives announced will help just eight plants in Quebec, while nearly 50 of them need loan guarantees. The Conservative government is stubbornly insisting that it cannot provide loan guarantees because that would upset the Americans.</ParaText><ParaText id="1571080">The Americans, for their part, are doing as they please, working to help their businesses and standing up for them while this Conservative government, with Liberal support, is not. People in the regions are paying the price. They are the ones having trouble making ends meet and making their mortgage payments. Quebec's forestry sector has been in trouble for a long time now. But the Conservatives have left people in the forestry sector and people in the regions of Quebec to their own devices.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1571081">In the motion I talked about earlier, the Quebec National Assembly also asked for improvements to the employment insurance system. There is something that does not make sense in the current situation, since we know that the system's funds were cut drastically in the 1990s by the Liberal government. Nearly $50 billion was taken away from unemployed workers. The Liberals did that, with the Conservatives' support. Now that they have taken and spent the money that belonged to the workers and employers, they are incapable of saying here today that we should give back the money taken from workers who are going through tough times.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1571082">But no, no one is doing that. Nothing is being done. We thought for a moment that the Liberals were beginning to wake up. They asked for an EI eligibility threshold of 360 hours. We thought they were perhaps beginning to understand. But that is not the case. They dropped the ball again. We saw the birth of this new coalition between the Conservatives and the Liberals. But once again, the Liberals returned to their normal ways. They tried to project another image, but no one was fooled. They tried to give a different impression, but quickly went back to their old ways.</ParaText><ParaText id="1571083">The Liberals and the Conservatives made a conscious decision to ignore the demands of Quebec. Instead of helping Quebec, they decided to deprive Quebec of substantial means to deal with the crisis. On the contrary—and this is what bothers Quebeckers most about the Liberals, who support the Conservatives, and the Conservatives themselves—they decided to respond to the wishes of Ontario and the west. </ParaText><ParaText id="1571084">The auto sector is in trouble; no one is denying that. However, when one sector is offered $10 billion and another sector is offered only a tenth of that, even though it is also struggling and has just as many workers, that is completely unfair.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1571085">The government offered $10 billion to the automotive industry and $1 billion to the forestry industry, which does not even suit the different companies in Quebec. It is completely unfair. It is fortunate that the Bloc Québécois is here now to defend people from the regions, the workers of Quebec, the different companies. We hear them, we understand their needs and we will defend them. We are prepared to put our seats on the line. We will vote against the estimates. The Liberals have wiped themselves out by creating a coalition and a bogus working group that at the end of the day will go nowhere. </ParaText><ParaText id="1571086">This Conservative-Liberal plan is a failure. The unemployment rate is still very high in Quebec—we have heard it is 8.7%—and the second progress report shows that the Conservatives have not even been able to provide what they promised. They are boasting that 80% of the plan is already being implemented. But when we are talking about a plan to support businesses, workers and families during a recession, an economic crisis, 100% of the program should be up and running right now, and that is not the case. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1571087">Building Canada, which we have heard so much about, was passed in the 2007 budget. We are still waiting for building Canada projects to be announced and carried out. It makes no sense. Here is an example. We are still waiting for the Super PEPS in Quebec City, which was announced as part of the building Canada program.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1571088">We saw what happened this week with this new coalition. I think that the people of Quebec realize that the Liberals and the Conservatives are one and the same and always will be.</ParaText><ParaText id="1571089">They said that they would fight for the unemployed who were going to starve this summer, but the following day they sat down and said they would create a working group. In the meantime, the people they said would starve during the summer have nothing. They just hope these people will not starve while waiting, but it will be fall before we see any concrete action.</ParaText><ParaText id="1571090">And even then, the working group will submit its report in the fall, but how long will it take before anything happens? What does the government, supported by the Liberals, really want to offer to Quebeckers, to people who are struggling? One has to wonder.</ParaText><ParaText id="1571091">I repeat; we will be voting against the estimates.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
