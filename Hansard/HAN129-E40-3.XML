					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Milliken" id="3739408"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128909" Type="15">The Speaker</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2312578">The member knows we are not having a debate on the motion. The motion has not been allowed yet. </ParaText><ParaText id="2312579">We are on a point of order as to whether or not there is a question of privilege to be raised here. I think that is what the hon. member is making submissions on. I know he would not want to debate a motion since one has not been allowed at this point.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Comartin" id="3739409"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128527" Type="2">Mr. Joe Comartin</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2312580">Mr. Speaker, I thank you for that correction.</ParaText><ParaText id="2312581">The request for the finding of privilege that was brought by the member for <Affiliation DbId="128638" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation> is troubling in that he had to do this on behalf of both the members of the finance committee, at least the opposition members of the finance committee, and all of us in the House. I say that in light of your ruling 11 months ago; a historical ruling by any standards in this House. </ParaText><ParaText id="2312582">Quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, and I do not want you to feel that I am buttering you up, but the reality is that the ruling was also a historical ruling in any number of other legislatures that use the Westminster system of representation in Parliament. It was acknowledged as such in a number of other legislatures. </ParaText><ParaText id="2312583">Therefore, it is very troubling, given the nature of the request for the finding of privilege or breach of privilege at that time on the issue of the Afghani detainee issue, that we are back here less than a year later on essentially the same issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="2312584"> The Conservative government of the day is claiming cabinet confidence and refusing to divulge information to the finance committee members that is clearly necessary for them to do their job. That is the essence of the privilege request.</ParaText><ParaText id="2312585">I think it is important that we walk through what has happened here. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2312586">There were requests at the finance committee for two types of information. This goes back to November 17, 2010. I will quote from the committee minutes at that point and from the report issued by the committee and presented to the House the first week of February.</ParaText><ParaText id="2312587">On November 17, the committee reported that:</ParaText><ParaText id="2312588"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The committee also orders that the Government of Canada provide the committee with electronic copies of the following: Five-year projections of total corporate profits before taxes and effective corporate tax rates (2010-11 to 2014-15);</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2312589">The response from the government, I have to say from discussing this with some of the members of the committee, was a bit surprising. It was an immediate verbal response at that time by members of the committee. I am not even sure that the government leadership was involved in this.</ParaText><ParaText id="2312590">Subsequently, there was a response from the government as follows:</ParaText><ParaText id="2312591"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Projections of corporate profits before taxes and effective corporate income tax rates are a Cabinet confidence. As such, we are not in a position to provide these series to the Committee.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2312592">That was the first one.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2312593">We know that the cost of the government's prime legislation, if I can use that generic term, has been an ongoing debate in the House, in various committees of the House, and in the general public. </ParaText><ParaText id="2312594">Again, it is crucial that we have this information in order to engage in the debate and the discussion around those issues, not only in the House but in the country as a whole. </ParaText><ParaText id="2312595">Therefore, the committee asked the government, in effect, ordered the government, to produce information with regard to a series of crime bills. That is set out in the report from the finance committee. </ParaText><ParaText id="2312596">The attempt on the part of the committee is obviously to make informed decisions on legislation that is before the House and to share that information with other committees. There is a whole series of bills that the committee set out in the order for information. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="05">(1005)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2312597">I will not quote all of the bills because it is in the report, but I will quote the information that members on the finance committee wanted with regard to those pieces of legislation before the House or those which have already been passed. They wanted to know:</ParaText><ParaText id="2312598"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">--the incremental cost estimates broken down by Capital, Operations &amp; Maintenance and Other categories;</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2312599">For a government that touts its fiscal prudence, it is interesting to note that it is unwilling to give that information to other members of the House in order for them to make decisions based on facts and good economic planning. Economic planning or public policy cannot be done without the facts. They wanted the costs.</ParaText><ParaText id="2312600"> The committee wanted to know:</ParaText><ParaText id="2312601"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2"> --the baseline departmental funding requirement excluding the impacts of the bills and Acts, broken down by Capital, Operations and Maintenance and Other categories;</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2312602">Members also wanted to know:</ParaText><ParaText id="2312603"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2"> --the total departmental Annual Reference Level (ARL), including all quasi-statutory and non-quasi-statutory items, including Capital, Operations and Maintenance and Other categories, including the incremental cost estimates;</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2312604">Finally, the finance committee asked for:</ParaText><ParaText id="2312605">
								<Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">--detailed cost accounting, analysis and projections, including assumptions, for each of the bills and Acts, conducted in accordance with the Treasury Board Guide to costing.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2312606">Finance committee members are asking for information that we know is available because it is required under Treasury Board criteria. We know from past practice that it is available and it has been submitted to ministers. In most cases, these bills would have also been in front of cabinet.</ParaText><ParaText id="2312607">The government's response to that was:</ParaText><ParaText id="2312608"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> The issue of whether there are any costs associated with the implementation of any of the Government's Justice bills is a matter of Cabinet confidence and, as such, the Government is not in a position to provide such information or documents.</QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText><ParaText id="2312609">By claiming cabinet confidence, the government absolutely refused to provide the information to the committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="2312610">As I said earlier, the report containing this information is before the House, before you, Mr. Speaker, and is the basis on which the request for finding a breach of privilege was brought before the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="2312611">To digress for a moment, I would like to make this important point. Both of these issues, the estimates of what the savings are going to be to the private sector by the tax cuts and what the projection for profits for those corporations is going to be, are crucial to the country. This may be the defining issue in the next election. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2312612">This is not a periphery area that we are trying to get information on. It is essential that we have this information in order for Canadians to understand the issue. At a personal level, it is absolutely crucial for us as members of Parliament to have the information when we are voting on the budget, on monetary bills, and a number of public policy issues. </ParaText><ParaText id="2312613">As justice critic for my party, I have been asking for this information from justice ministers and ministers of public safety for four years, and regularly I get two answers.</ParaText><ParaText id="2312614">First, the cost analysis has not been done, and I have to wonder about the truthfulness of that answer. That may have been accurate earlier on when the government came into power in 2006, but that has not been the case since then. We know that these projection analyses have been done on the capital cost of the crime bills, and on the operation and maintenance costs.</ParaText><ParaText id="2312615">Just last week our critic on public safety had some material leaked to him showing how many more employees were going to be hired by Corrections Canada. The government has that information.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2312616">The whole issue of crime legislation has been a centre point for the government. It has been a centre point for the Conservative Party before it was government. However, when we try to ascertain the facts as to what this will cost, how many additional prisoners we will have in custody, we are denied that information.</ParaText><ParaText id="2312617">Again, this is not a peripheral issue here. It is a very basic one that is very much in public debate not only in the House but across the country. That debate has been both in this House and in committee. It has been narrowed down to a very narrow scope because we cannot get access to this information.</ParaText><ParaText id="2312618">With regard to its history, as I have previously stated, we have had the refusal from the government. Of course, it is not the first time it has done this, as I have said earlier, because of your ruling. It is just vitally important that it is not allowed to get away with it.</ParaText><ParaText id="2312619">Last night, as I was preparing some notes on this, I was thinking about how important information and knowledge is. We hear the cliché that knowledge is power. That is really what this is about. It is a very fundamental part of our democracy and, in particular, of the parliamentary system. We can go back hundreds of years and I will be making some reference to that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2312620">Historically, over centuries, the theory and principle of the divine right of kings was undermined once people realized that because one was born to a certain family, it did not give that person divine powers to govern better than a person who was born a peasant. This allowed democracy to flourish. </ParaText><ParaText id="2312621">Also, throughout the Renaissance period in particular, if we look at advancements such as the development of printing and the ability to communicate information and knowledge, we see a huge increase in the rate at which democracy came to the fore.</ParaText><ParaText id="2312622">Governments, particularly in Europe but also true in other areas of the world, restrained the development and sharing of scientific fact and information as they feared it would undermine their control.</ParaText><ParaText id="2312623"> As a species, and I will move into <I>Star Trek</I> fairly soon if I continue on this way, we find ourselves seeking out information because we believe it enhances our lives as well as our lifestyles. For instance, we proved that the Earth was not flat by moving beyond the continent that we were on at the time.</ParaText><ParaText id="2312624">All of that is the basis on which the Westminster system determined that parliamentarians have an absolute right to information. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2312625">We as a country developed and so did our democracy. For instance, we instituted the CBC, the Canadian Broadcast Corporation, in an effort to share more information to help unify the country because it allowed us to know and understand more about each other. </ParaText><ParaText id="2312626">We are doing the same thing in this generation with the Internet, which is now also used to share information, as our--</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Milliken" id="3739429"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128909" Type="15">The Speaker</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2312627">Perhaps the hon. member could keep his remarks relevant to the point of order on the question of privilege that was raised. It is interesting to hear about the Westminster model and its impact on Canada. However, the point that we are dealing with is a question regarding these documents and what constitutes a cabinet confidence. </ParaText><ParaText id="2312628">Perhaps the member could be more specific in his comments and deal with this point.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Comartin" id="3739430"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128527" Type="2">Mr. Joe Comartin</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2312629">Mr. Speaker, I think it is relevant that we understand where that came from. I will stop with the examples in that regard but it is fundamental to this democracy in Canada that we have access to these documents.</ParaText><ParaText id="2312630">I will now go to the points you made in your ruling, Mr. Speaker, back on April 27 of last year. I will quote from that decision because when we look at what is going on here, there is absolutely no way that this confidence that is being claimed exists. As I finish, I will be talking specifically about the provisions within the Evidence Act and the Information Act to show even more extensively that this information has to be divulged to the Canadian people as a whole.</ParaText><ParaText id="2312631">However, within the context of Parliament, you ruled at page 19 of the hard copy of that decision of April 27, that:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2312632"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Before us are issues that question the very foundations upon which our parliamentary system is built. In a system of responsible government, the fundamental right of the House of Commons to hold the government to account for its actions is an indisputable privilege and in fact an obligation. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2312633"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Embedded in our Constitution, parliamentary law and even in our Standing Orders, it is the source of our parliamentary system for which other processes and principles necessarily flow, and it is why that right is manifested in numerous procedures of the House, from the daily question period to the detailed examination by committees of estimates, to reviews of the accounts of Canada, to debate, amendments, and votes on legislation. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2312634">That is very pertinent to the request that was made by the finance committee. </ParaText><ParaText id="2312635">You go on to say:</ParaText><ParaText id="2312636"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">As I noted on December 10, 2009, <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, Second Edition, states at page 136: </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2312637"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">By virtue of the Preamble and section 18 of the Constitution Act, 1867, Parliament has the ability to institute its own inquiries, to require the attendance of witnesses and to order the production of documents, rights which are fundamental to its proper functioning. These rights are as old as Parliament itself. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2312638">Mr. Speaker, at page 978 to 979, you state:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2312639"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The Standing Orders do not delimit the power to order the production of papers and records. The result is a broad, absolute power that on the surface appears to be without restriction. There is no limit on the type of papers likely to be requested, the only prerequisite is that the papers exist--in hard copy or electronic format--and that they are located in Canada.... </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2312640"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">No statute or practice diminishes the fullness of the power rooted in the House privileges unless there is an explicit legal provision to that effect, or unless the House adopts a specific resolution limiting the power. The House has never set a limit on its power to order the production of papers and records. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2312641">If I can just digress for a second, that is very pertinent to what is being requested. We know from a number of things that the paper exists. There are some points that we expect the government will say, such as that there are some limits on this, but I will come back to that in a few minutes. </ParaText><ParaText id="2312642">You go on further, Mr. Speaker, by quoting Bourinot's fourth edition at page 70, to state:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2312643"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The Senate and House of Commons have the right, inherent in them as legislative bodies, to summon and compel the attendance of all persons, within the limits of their jurisdiction, as witnesses, and to order them to bring with them such papers and records as may be required for the purpose of an inquiry.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2312644"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">In the arguments presented, the Chair has heard this power described as unabridged, unconditional, unqualified, absolute and, furthermore, one which is limited only by the discretion of the House itself. However, this view is not shared by all and so it is a privilege whose limits have now been called into question. </QuotePara>
								</Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2312645">Again, you were referring to the position that the government took at that point, under a national security argument, that we were not entitled to the documents that were being sought.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2312646">Mr. Speaker, you went on to say:</ParaText><ParaText id="2312647"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The government's view is that such an unqualified right does not exist for either House of Parliament or their committees. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2312648">That was the position the government took. Again, I just find it very troubling that it is taking that position again now. You went on to say:</ParaText><ParaText id="2312649"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The executor, the holder of the sensitive information sought by the House has competing obligations.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2312650"> That was the argument it was making at that time. I will not go on because that argument had more to do with the issue of national security and that is not being raised in this one.</ParaText><ParaText id="2312651">I want to go on because the claim for confidence that we got was a cabinet confidence as opposed a ministerial claim for confidence. I do not know if the government was trying to make a differentiation there.</ParaText><ParaText id="2312652">Mr. Speaker, you went on in the same decision, to state: </ParaText><ParaText id="2312653"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...Bourinot’s Second Edition notes that even in instances where a minister refuses to provide documents that are requested, it is clear that it is still ultimately up to the House to determine whether grounds exist to withhold documents. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2312654"> It is not in the minister's control and not in the cabinet's control. It is only here in this House that that decision can be made.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2312655">Mr. Speaker, you go on to quote <I>Erskine May</I> as an additional authority for that. Again, I want to emphasize the historical nature because it goes way back. There is no basis on which the government can be doing what it is doing at this point.</ParaText><ParaText id="2312656">Mr. Speaker, you quote <I>Erskine May</I> stating:</ParaText><ParaText id="2312657"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...underlying the Bill of Rights [1689] is the privilege of both Houses to the exclusive cognizance of their own proceedings. Both Houses retain the right to be sole judge of the lawfulness of their own proceedings, and to settle—or depart from—their own codes of procedure. This is equally the case where the House in question is dealing with a matter which is finally decided by its sole authority, such as an order or resolution, or whether (like a bill) it is the joint concern of both Houses. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2312658">That power resides here in this chamber, or in the other House, but not in the hands of a minister or the cabinet, which is really what is being claimed at this point, if the short answer and short denial we got can be understood without any interpretation.</ParaText><ParaText id="2312659">Mr. Speaker, you go on in that to look at other legislatures, Australia in particular, where it had made similar findings as to what you found in that decision.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2312660">Mr. Speaker, you ultimately concluded, at page 27 of the hard copy, that:</ParaText><ParaText id="2312661"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">It is the view of the Chair that accepting an unconditional authority of the executive to censor the information provided to Parliament would in fact jeopardize the very separation of powers that is purported to lie at the heart of our parliamentary system and the independence of its constituent parts. Furthermore, it risks diminishing the inherent privileges of the House and its members, which have been earned and must be safeguarded. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2312662"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">As has been noted earlier, procedural authorities are categorical in repeatedly asserting the powers of the House in ordering the production of documents. No exceptions are made for any category of government documents, even those related to national security. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2312663">The government is certainly not claiming that in this case.</ParaText><ParaText id="2312664">You went on, Mr. Speaker, and drew the very definitive conclusion and made the decision that there was no authority to hold back those documents, that provisions had to be made for those to be released if we accepted the government on its face that they were national security documents.</ParaText><ParaText id="2312665">Here we are talking about documents that are of a financial nature, information that is clearly available, as well as the information on the cost of the prisons and those related crime bills.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2312666">I also want to note that we have heard from the Liberal Party, both from the member for <Affiliation DbId="128638" Type="2">Kings—Hants</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="128094" Type="2">Mississauga South</Affiliation>, on this point and the official opposition is taking the same position. We are taking the same position and are asking you to uphold the decision you made last year, in this case. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2312667">I have the position taken by the Bloc Québécois in the arguments it made on March 18 of last year before your ruling, Mr. Speaker. Its position was that there was no basis for the government's claim and even less, if you look at that. However, I would draw to your attention the argument that was made at that point. You may want to consider that if the Bloc does not speak to this before you make your ruling.</ParaText><ParaText id="2312668">I have one final point, which moves more into the legal area. There is a provision in the Canada Evidence Act, section 39, that sets out a procedure by which the government must exercise its right to claim cabinet confidence and under what circumstances. Then there is the Access to Information Act that sets out in section 69 where it cannot claim that under some circumstances. I will just deal with the criteria. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2312669">Normal procedure is for the Clerk of the Privy Council to certify which documents cabinet confidence can be claimed and where it applies. We do not know if that has been done here. For the two pieces of information we want, we got a bland denial. We do not know if the Clerk of the Privy Council, because we do not have that fact in front of us, has certified some of these documents as being within cabinet confidence.</ParaText><ParaText id="2312670">Under the procedure set out in section of 39 of the Canada Evidence Act, the Clerk of the Privy Council is required to exclude from any claims of cabinet confidence discussion documents. It would be our position, based on the information that we are seeking, that it would fall into the category of discussion documents and, therefore, the confidence does not apply.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2312671">However, even if it does apply and the documents can somehow be construed as not being discussion documents, which I find hard to imagine as my mind is not quite that creative, although maybe the government is, subsection 69(1)(3) sets out that a claim of confidence is only applicable until a decision is made. In this case, it is quite clear that the decision around corporate tax breaks was made several years ago in the form of a budget. All of the crime bills have been tabled in the House and some have even passed. On all of that, a decision has been made in both cases.</ParaText><ParaText id="2312672">I want to quote section 69 so it appears in <I>Hansard</I>. Subsection 69(1) sets out the fact that there is a double step. The right to access the rest of the act is all the authority one has, both as individuals and as individual members of this society, and we have to ask for information from the government.</ParaText><ParaText id="2312673">Subsection 69(2) defines who fits into that category where information does not have to be given and the cabinet is part of that.

All of us have heard from Canadians about the need to take action to ensure that white collar criminals are held to account for their actions and the need to stand up for the victims of their crimes. Canadians have been quite clear. They want us to take action now and they want us to take action quickly, which is what the motion today intends to do.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313049">Just a few years ago, many people might have regarded crimes such as fraud as victimless crimes since they seem to be committed against large organizations, corporations or governments.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2313050">Today, things have changed. We are now increasingly seeing the human face of fraud. I think it is safe to say that many Canadians have been shocked and angered by the harms caused by these acts. Savings have been wiped out and lives have been ruined. For many victims, they can never be returned to the position they were in before the crime.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313051">As we know, under the current system, white collar offenders can be released after as little as one-sixth of their sentence in prison for their crimes. Bill <Document DbId="4930488" Type="3">C-59</Document> would give us all a chance to change this and to support Canadians who have become the victims of crime.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313052">Helping victims of crime has always been at the heart of this government's public safety and justice agenda. Our government is committed to ensuring that their voices are heard and that their concerns are taken seriously. That is one of our highest priorities and why we have taken action on a number of fronts.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313053"> Crime places a heavy toll on individual victims, their families, communities and society at large. That is why we have taken action to ensure that the scales of justice are balanced to include victims. One way we did this was by committing $52 million over four years to enhance the federal victims strategy so that government could better meet the needs of victims.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2313054">As one of our first moves, we created the Office of the Federal Ombudsman for Victims of Crime as an independent resource for victims.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313055">The National Office for Victims at Public Safety Canada is also working to give victims a greater voice in the corrections and conditional release process and assisting victims in getting access to the information and services that they might need. </ParaText><ParaText id="2313056">The Policy Centre for Victim Issues at the Department of Justice is also helping the government better meet the needs of victims, for example, by giving them the resources to attend parole hearings and to seek help if they experience crime while abroad.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313057">Our government is also going one step further in helping victims connect to the services they need with the online victim services directory, which is available on the website of the Department of Justice Canada. The directory lets victims search for appropriate agencies in their area according to the type of victimization they have experienced and the type of support they seek. Our hope is that it can help ease the burden on victims of crime who do not know where to turn or which services are available to them.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313058">All of those measures help to bring victims front and centre in the justice system and to ensure that their voices are heard.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313059">In addition, of course, our government has also introduced a wide range of legislation to crack down on crime, gun crimes, in particular.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2313060">As well, our government has passed legislation to help combat the complex, serious and growing problems of identity theft and identity fraud.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313061">We have also ensured that victims have a greater say in this country's parole system by introducing legislation that, among other things, would enshrine in law a victim's right to attend and make statements at Parole Board of Canada hearings, while preventing offenders, in most cases, from withdrawing their parole applications 14 days or less before a hearing date.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313062">Victims of crime have asked for these changes. And our government has delivered.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313063">Bill <Document DbId="4930488" Type="3">C-59</Document> builds on and strengthens this already impressive track record of standing up for victims.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313064">Victims of white collar crimes, and of fraud in particular, have been dismayed, in many cases, to find out that the offenders who carry out these acts can be released so soon after they are sentenced. Unless the Parole Board of Canada has reasonable grounds to believe these offenders will commit a violent offence if released, it must automatically release them into the community under supervision. This means that in some cases a fraudster, for example, could be back on the streets early.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2313065">Such a criminal could be sentenced to 12 years, but actually released into the community on day parole in just 2 years and fully paroled in just 4 years. The status quo gives the Parole Board of Canada no discretion in dealing with these cases. </ParaText><ParaText id="2313066">The test is whether an offender is likely to commit a violent offence. As a result, even if the Parole Board believes the offender is likely to commit another fraud, theft or drug offence, it is compelled to release him or her. This truly offends Canadians' sense of justice. It undermines their faith in our justice and corrections system. Victims and, indeed, all Canadians want to see justice carried out and sentences served. Bill <Document DbId="4930488" Type="3">C-59</Document> would do that.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313067">Bill <Document DbId="4930488" Type="3">C-59</Document> would, first and foremost, do away with the current system's accelerated parole review, whereby offenders who commit non-violent crimes such as fraud can be released on day parole after serving as little as one-sixth of their sentence. Under the changes our government is proposing, offenders who commit fraud and other white collar crimes will be put on the same footing as other offenders. They will be eligible for regular day parole review six months prior to full parole eligibility and full parole review after serving one-third of their sentences. They will have to face the full consequences of their actions.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2313068">The message that we are sending with Bill <Document DbId="4930488" Type="3">C-59</Document> is that if people commit the crime, they will do the time. We are saying with this legislation that the needs of victims are paramount. We are saying that their interests come first. We are saying that all of us remain committed to cracking down on crime and standing up for the rights of victims. That is what Canadians want. They want us to continue standing up for victims and to ensure that their voices are heard. They want us to continue to ensure that all offenders are held to account for their actions.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313069">Most of all, Canadians want us to work together in the spirit of co-operation to take action now to ensure the changes our government is proposing are passed into law so victims of fraud and other white collar crimes can in fact see justice done.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313070"> I therefore urge all hon. members to support the motion before us today and to work with the government to ensure Bill <Document DbId="4930488" Type="3">C-59</Document> receives speedy passage.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The Bloc Québécois always acts with a great deal of caution when it comes to amending the Criminal Code. We are very aware of that. However, crime is constantly evolving. There are crimes today that were practically unthinkable a decade ago. Now there are white collar criminals, whereas it used to be mostly people selling poor-quality products. Sometimes certain criminals were able to extort small amounts of money.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313115">Over the past decade or so, globalization has resulted in an explosion of financial products on the market. Crooks, criminals, figured that there was money to be made by fooling honest people out of their hard-earned money. These criminals promise incredible interest rates and astronomical returns.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2313116">I had the opportunity to speak with a victim of white collar crime. It is not always easy to recognize this kind of criminal. Often, these criminals will do their work when it has been announced that a mutual fund or investment fund has had incredible returns.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313117">People who have seen this kind of news on television are offered a product with similar returns by an acquaintance or a friend of a friend. The would-be victims do not say yes right away. People protect their savings; they are tight-fisted and take their time. White collar criminals take a step back and wait for more media reports about returns.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313118">The Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec does not make a lot of noise when it suffers a loss, but when the returns are amazing, it does not hesitate to hold press conferences. And I am not even talking about corporate and bank profits.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2313119">People pay attention to the news. These days, information travels at light speed. Something that happens on the other side of the world will be reported on our little devices. I will not name them, because I do not want to advertise them. Our little hand-held computers allow us to access information very quickly. People of all ages, people who are not necessarily financial experts, but who have worked hard for their money, can have their life savings stolen from them by crooks.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313120">The criminals are then caught and put on trial, and this gets lots of media attention because it affects a lot of people. They do not swindle just one individual. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2313121">When people are exploited and realize that they were not the only ones, this means that whoever swindled them knew what he was doing. In order to cheat dozens if not hundreds of victims, criminals need to have a good sales pitch, and they often use the media to make their pitch.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313122">When these criminals are sentenced, the sentence can be considered important. The problem is that since the entire parole system is based on reintegration and how violent the crimes were, our judicial system is not set up for criminals who are not physically violent. These criminals are mentally violent, but not physically. In order to steal the life savings of honest people who worked their whole lives, one would have to be very psychologically violent. This is not physical violence; it is another kind of violence.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2313123">Obviously, the entire parole system has not been able to adjust to this because the principle of social reintegration still prevails. The criminal goes to prison, behaves very well, and in any case, the system has ruined him and that is just great. Often, the criminal has declared bankruptcy. He no longer has any assets. He has nothing left. We try to find out whether he hid anything in a tax haven. When we see the agreements the Conservative government is signing with Panama, a country on the OECD's blacklist or grey list of tax havens—it does not reveal the names of people who invest there, and there is no tax agreement with Panama—these questions remain. People always want to know whether the criminal has managed to hide money away. Most of the time, when the individual leaves prison, he is ruined. He no longer has any money and he leaves with his tail between his legs to try to reintegrate into society. And he gets parole after serving one-sixth of his sentence. It is very difficult to find out that someone like Vincent Lacroix can get out after serving one-sixth of his sentence, after he has ruined lives and admitted during his trial that he spent exorbitant amounts of money at strip clubs and the like. The judicial system will adapt.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2313124">I hear the Liberals and the New Democrats getting all worked up and saying that some criminals who would have been entitled to parole will not be, but a criminal is a criminal. He receives a sentence and he has to serve that sentence. There will still be parole, but not after one-sixth of the sentence has been served. Judges will adjust the sentences accordingly.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313125">That is why the Bloc Québécois is very reticent about minimum sentences. We want to leave sentencing up to the judiciary, to judges. A judge is a neutral and competent person who often is called on to hear a number of similar cases and is able to hand down a sentence that fits the crime. Now the judge will know that the criminal can no longer be released after serving only one-sixth of his sentence. We will see how the courts adapt.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2313126">One thing is for certain: this must stop. Parole after serving one-sixth of a sentence is no longer acceptable given the new crimes that have been committed in our society over the past 10 years. Clearly, the biggest losers will be the criminals. Are we going to cry over what happens to criminals? I have heard the Liberals and the New Democrats crying, but I will not. These criminals were sentenced and they must serve their time. That is life and, as I was saying, the judges will adjust sentences accordingly.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313127">Once again, the Bloc Québécois is prepared to support any measures that are reasonable and acceptable to our society, and Bill <Document DbId="4930488" Type="3">C-59</Document> falls into that category.</ParaText>

I want to read it at the beginning so people watching will have an idea of what the motion is about. It reads:</ParaText><ParaText id="2313135"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That, in the opinion of the House, the government should continue to recognize the vital role of older workers in the Canadian economy and ensure its labour market programs and policies encourage older workers to contribute their skills and experience in the Canadian workforce.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2313136">I would expect that the motion will in fact pass. It comes out of a number of initiatives the government has taken in support of older workers and retraining in the workforce.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313137">I want to note that the member for <Affiliation DbId="128090" Type="2">Edmonton East</Affiliation>, when he made his presentation on October 4, 2010, gave some statistics that I found rather interesting in his speech. He indicated that in 1900, over a century ago, Canadian men had a life expectancy of only 47 years, while women could expect to live just under 3 years longer.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313138">When the first old age pension was brought in by the federal government in 1927, payments began at the age of 70. On that basis, most Canadians would not live long enough to collect the pension as the average life expectancy was, by that time, 59 years for men and age 62 for women.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2313139">As indicated, under the Canadian pension plan, the pension was introduced in 1927. I want to make some observations about that, because after World War I, there was increased urbanization in Canada and industrialization. It led to an increase in demand for old age pensions. I had statistics on pensions in other countries. There were a number of countries had pensions in place before 1935.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313140">The member for <Affiliation DbId="164895" Type="2">Winnipeg North</Affiliation> will be pleased to hear that in 1916, Manitoba, our home province, was the first province to pass a Mothers' Pension Act to provide a small but assured income to widows and divorced or deserted wives with children to support, deemed the worthy poor.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313141">Within five years, all provinces from Ontario west had similar legislation called public assistance. This help was based on a means test and constituted a modern version of the English poor law.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313142">This will show how things really have not changed over the years. In 1919, the federal Liberal Party pledged to pass legislation on health insurance, contributory old age pensions and unemployment insurance, but alas, none of these promises were kept. At that point, the British North America Act was cited as the main impediment. The reality is that business interests which funded the two major parties at the time were a hindrance.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2313143">It was 1927 before the old age pension did in fact become law. It came about during the government of William Lyon Mackenzie King, but the introduction was based on a promise to the two Labour MPs at the time, J.S. Woodsworth and A.A. Heaps. It provided a maximum, by the way, of $20 a month, and it was subject to a means test. </ParaText><ParaText id="2313144">I have a copy of the letter which was sent to Mackenzie King in January 1926. I spent some time early this morning reading <I>Hansard</I> from 1927. It was a very interesting experience.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313145">The letter was sent to both the Liberal leader, Mr. King but also, as an equal opportunity group I gather, it was decided to let the Conservatives have a chance at it too. It reads as follows: </ParaText><ParaText id="2313146"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Dear Mr. King:</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2313147"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">As representatives of Labour in the House of Commons, may we ask whether it is your intention to introduce at this session legislation with regard to (a) Provision for the unemployed; (b) Old Age Pensions.

The Conservative leader was unwilling, even if it meant getting his hands on the government, to support either proposal at the time. Woodsworth and Heaps, the two labour representatives, accepted Mackenzie King's offer to pursue old age pensions and gave him their support.

Their knowledge and invaluable capacity for mentoring younger, less experienced workers is incredibly valuable to our economy, especially at this time.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313155">The motion is also timely as it speaks to our Conservative government's focus on providing appropriate labour market programs and policies so that older workers can continue contributing to our economy by their skills and experience. Their experience, knowledge and talents are key factors in our full economic recovery and Canada's continuing international competitiveness.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2313156">The motion also recognizes a shift in work patterns and in retirement planning. Given that Canadians are living longer, healthier lives than in the past, more workers are choosing to extend their careers through their late 60s and into their 70s. Today Canadians expect to live about 30 years longer on average than we did a century ago. They know they can continue to contribute and still have time for a well-earned retirement and leisure period when they are a little older.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313157">Mandatory retirement for the most part is a thing of the past as older workers in good health want to continue contributing to society. This is an important development and one that will not only become more important in the short and medium term, but well into the future. Our population is aging and our workforce is not growing as quickly as it did in years past. Given our demographic challenges and a slower growth in our workforce, Canada needs as many workers as possible to be active and contributing in the coming years.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2313158">In a very short time, our labour market will again begin to experience serious labour shortages. Our task is to remove as many of the disincentives as we can that face workers who want to and who are able to continue working. We need to be active. We need to promote activity in the workforce. We certainly cannot be passive. Failing to act in this way will only serve to reduce our prosperity in the future.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313159">For older workers who do not want to retire and are healthy enough to continue working, I ask why not? Why not utilize their wealth of knowledge, skills and enterprise? This is certainly good for the economy. If Canadians choose to continue working we should facilitate their wishes.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313160">Our Conservative government agrees and we are taking action to encourage older people to be engaged in worthwhile endeavours of their own choosing. We named a <Affiliation DbId="165141" Type="4">Minister of State for Seniors</Affiliation> who is tasked with supporting our aging population, whether it be working to combat elder abuse or supporting volunteer initiatives through the new horizons for seniors program which we expended in the last budget.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2313161">Another initiative to address a larger issue of an aging society was our government's creation of a National Seniors Council in 2007 to advise the government on all matters related to seniors' well-being and quality of life. To date, the council reported on elder abuse, low income issues among seniors, volunteering among seniors, and positive and active aging. We are working with the provinces and have increased funding under the targeted initiative for older workers program to assist unemployed older workers in vulnerable communities to retrain and gain new skills.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313162">More than 14,000 unemployed older workers have been assisted through more than 200 projects that have been approved to date. This is concrete help that is good for the workers as individuals and good for Canada as a whole.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313163">As one participant said, “This has strengthened my belief that I can and will re-enter the workforce.”</ParaText><ParaText id="2313164">Under labour market development agreements, older workers can also receive assistance. They are part of the unemployed workforce that is being helped with a $1.95 billion fund provided to the provinces and territories. Under these agreements, the workers receive programming to help them get back to work.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313165">In Canada's economic action plan, funding was increased by $1 billion over two years. More than 100,000 workers over the age of 50 participate in these programs each year.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2313166">For workers not eligible for unemployment insurance we have labour market agreements that help unemployed workers, including older Canadians, return to work.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313167">As well, our Conservative government appointed an expert panel on older workers in January 2007. The panel examined the long-term issues facing older workers, including any barriers or disincentives to their continued participation in the labour market. The report recommended an employability approach and advocated removing all systemic barriers.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2313168">This motion and our Conservative government's actions are in agreement with the report's findings. Our government is interested in working closely with all the provinces and territories. We recognize there are regional differences in their approach and regional needs. Our labour market development agreements and labour market agreements are flexible enough to take that into account.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313169">Through our actions, we have shown that we welcome the chance for older workers to contribute their skills and experience to our labour market. In doing so, they are increasing their prosperity and the prosperity of all of Canada. We have faith in older workers and we have demonstrated that faith through our actions.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2313170">Unfortunately, it seems that sometimes we see an astonishing lack of faith for some of the members of the opposition, especially members of the Bloc Québécois. While they say that they support older workers, they have consistently voted against all help for older workers that we have put forward. The proof is in their voting record.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313171"> The Bloc Québécois members have voted against the targeted initiative for older worker program. They have voted against our Conservative government's extension and improvements to the work training program, which has helped to protect the jobs of over 265,000 Canadians through over 9,000 agreements. They have voted against our legislation to provide extra weeks of employment insurance benefits to long-tenured workers. They have voted against tax reductions for seniors.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313172"> However, the Bloc members continue to call for the reintroduction of failed passive income support programs, which were proven to be costly and ineffective and would serve as large disincentives to work and labour force participation. Therefore, they appear to be in favour of those things which are harmful to our economy and harmful to the prosperity of workers that simply do not work and have been proven to be so. I am not sure what they have against older workers. However, they need to stand up and support the older people. They should stop attempting to resurrect failed programs that do nothing to help older workers, but in fact do them harm.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2313173">Our Conservative government will continue to stand up for older workers. We will continue to have faith in older workers and to value and encourage their participation in the workforce.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313174"> I hope all members of the House of Commons will support not only this motion, but support our government's positive efforts for older Canadians.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

However, we maintain that an assistance program for older workers would be one of the best tools for helping workers aged 55 and older who have lost their jobs. Such a program would help them to find other employment and would provide them with income that could cover the difference between the wages they were earning and the wages of their new job, as was the case when such a program existed.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2313177">The Conservatives think that when people lose their jobs, they simply need to retrain and find new ones. With this retraining program, all of our forestry workers will end up being computer experts. That is how the Conservatives work, but the trees continue to grow. Forestry operations must continue. We should be ensuring, instead, that we hold onto these workers who have lost their jobs so that they can be put to work again when the economy is doing better. That is why the program for older worker adjustment, which was abolished, was so important. It was abolished for two reasons. At the time, the economy was doing better and the Liberals had a lot of trouble with their own spending and never saw fit to get it back on track. The Conservatives are heading in the same direction, which is sad. </ParaText><ParaText id="2313178">Motion M-515, regarding older workers, states:</ParaText><ParaText id="2313179"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That, in the opinion of the House, the government should continue to recognize the vital role of older workers in the Canadian economy and ensure its labour market programs and policies encourage older workers to contribute their skills and experience in the Canadian workforce.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2313180">We will support this motion, even though it seems incomplete. We agree that older workers actively contribute to the economy. In moving this motion, my colleague is surely making reference to the targeted initiative for older workers, or TIOW. This program was designed to improve the employability of participants from 55 to 64 years of age, and assist them through activities such as prior learning assessment, skills upgrading and experience in new fields of work. But this measure is in no way an income support measure for older workers who are unable to find a new job. As I said in the beginning, this is far from being the program for older worker adjustment we once knew.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313181">In fact, this Conservative government continues to ignore the needs of older workers who are the victims of mass layoffs or plant closures. The Bloc Québécois has been fighting in the House for years to give these older workers an income support measure to help them through the transition until they receive their pension benefits.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2313182">In fact, the Bloc has been defending this position since 1997. We must remember that in 1997, the Liberal government at the time eliminated POWA, the older worker adjustment program. In the same way it misappropriated employment insurance funds to pay down the deficit on the backs of the unemployed, that same Liberal government eliminated POWA to pay down the deficit on the backs of older workers.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313183">Since that time, the Bloc Québécois has not relented in calling for a support program for older workers who cannot be retrained.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313184">In 2005 we even convinced the House to unanimously adopt a motion asking the government to implement a strategy to help older workers who were losing their jobs due to factory closures in the wake of globalization. This strategy was to include income support measures. Let us remember that the Conservatives, who were in opposition at that time, supported this motion. As for the Liberals, they did not reinstate the program they had eliminated in 1997.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2313185">In April 2006, the House unanimously adopted the Bloc's subamendment to the Conservative government's Speech from the Throne. This subamendment once again called for a strategy to help older workers who were losing their jobs. Again, this strategy was to include income support measures. And, just like the Liberals, the Conservatives did nothing to help these workers. They continue to refuse to implement this type of program, saying that it does not help older workers return to the workforce. However, workforce reintegration measures and income support measures are not mutually exclusive.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2313186">We agree that these workers should have access to assistance programs in order to reposition themselves on the labour market. However, we also need to provide income support measures for those who cannot retrain. Age does present a certain challenge after losing one's job, because employers are more reluctant to hire older workers. Moreover, although people aged 55 and over are less affected by unemployment than younger people who are unemployed, it is usually for a much longer period than the average.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313187">An income support measure like the one we are proposing would stop these workers who cannot retrain from having to dip into their hard-earned retirement savings. Such a measure would give them some income support after their employment insurance benefits end and before their retirement pension begins. It would serve as a bridge for them while they are waiting for another job or for their pension. It is simply a matter of social justice and that is precisely what the Conservatives do not understand. A perfect example is the member for <Affiliation DbId="128366" Type="2">Jonquière—Alma</Affiliation>. In the December 2, 2007, issue of the weekly newspaper <I>Le Réveil</I>, in response to urgent calls to restore the POWA, the member suggested that workers should move to Alberta.

As it is for my colleagues in the Bloc, it is an honour for me to represent the concerns of my voters, of Quebeckers. We are the voice of our constituents in Ottawa, not the other way around, like the Conservatives. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2313194">That is why, election after election, Quebeckers elect a majority of Bloc Québécois members. They want their voice to be heard in Ottawa, they want their concerns conveyed to Ottawa. It is also for that reason that the Bloc Québécois continues to defend older workers in Ottawa.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313195">The crisis in the manufacturing sector and the economic crisis have led to the closure of businesses, which in turn has hit older workers hard. Providing them with access to training is one thing; however, those who are unable to find a new job are left to fend for themselves. If they are still unemployed after exhausting their employment insurance benefits, they are forced to turn to social assistance. To access social assistance they must deplete their assets. The Conservatives remain insensitive to these situations and prefer to deliver Ottawa's message: income support does not provide an incentive to work. But establishing an income support program is a matter of social justice, dignity and respect for these workers who helped build the Quebec we know today.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2313196">We will support motion M-515 but we are still calling for an assistance program for older workers. These people have made major contributions to our economy. I am thinking particularly of the forestry sector, which accounted for 45% of Quebec's economy. Now, it amounts to approximately 22% of the Canadian economy. These people have lost their employment for economic reasons. We cannot simply tell them that they need to retrain. At age 55 or over, it is not easy for people to find a job and to retrain because of their age and because of employers' restrictions. An assistance program for older workers would enable these people to receive a decent income after their employment insurance benefits end and until they retire. </ParaText><ParaText id="2313197">That is why the Bloc Québécois will fight every day for older workers. We will support motion M-515 but the Conservative government must understand that, if it had $10 billion to help the automotive industry, it should be able to help older workers. It has the resources. The Bloc Québécois will continue to work toward this goal.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

A new survey confirms what the NDP has been saying for a long time that improving the Canada pension plan is the best way to secure a comfortable retirement for all Canadians. The survey found a whopping 76% of Canadians want the government to increase CPP benefits. However, that flies in the face of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s recent decision to ignore the CPP in favour of a private sector retirement plan.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313205"> The survey also reinforces the New Democrat retirement security plan. Our plan proposes a phased-in doubling of CPP benefits to $1,868 a month. A full 93% of Canadians are already members of the CPP. It is low cost, secure, and inflation protected. That really makes it the best retirement option out there. Canadians know it, the New Democrats know it, but the Conservative government still does not have a clue.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2313206">Canada is facing a retirement crisis. The recession exposed deep flaws in the way we prepare for retirement. Families have lost their savings and they simply do not have enough to support themselves. That is why the NDP wants to take a lead on pension reform. In addition to raising CPP, we want to protect workplace pensions from corporate creditors and raise the GIS to lift seniors out of poverty. While the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is ignoring the crisis, we are taking leadership and actually proposing practical solutions to make Canadians' lives better. </ParaText><ParaText id="2313207">As I said, the recession revealed deep cracks in Canada's retirement security plan because years of savings suddenly vanished, leaving millions of Canadians unprepared for the future. We did take the lead on calling for comprehensive reform to the Canada pension plan, like proposing doubling of the maximum monthly payout over time to ensure that all Canadians could retire comfortably.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2313208">The Conservative government seemed on board, hinting for nearly a year that it would improve the CPP. Then, the Conservatives abruptly changed their mind. In December, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> announced that the government would ignore the CPP, choosing instead to introduce a private sector plan administered by financial institutions. </ParaText><ParaText id="2313209">Pension advocates and most provincial leaders, including the provincial leader and the minister of finance in Nova Scotia, expressed shock and disappointment. They asked, why would the government abandon the CPP, which is secure, portable, and low cost? Why would they turn over retirement savings to the very financial institutions whose outrageous management fees could wipe out up to 50% of a person's pension contributions over a lifetime?</ParaText><ParaText id="2313210">The Conservative government's plan just does not make sense for older workers and when older workers move into retirement.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2313211">Canada is in a pension crisis and that is why the NDP will continue to push for practical reforms to CPP; ones that benefit Canadians and not the big banks. </ParaText><ParaText id="2313212">Older workers are disproportionately represented among the long-term unemployed. This is true across Canada, but it is especially true across the industrial heartland of our country.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313213">These companies were institutions in our communities. They were unionized workplaces where seniority mattered and where companies had the benefit of the skills, experience, and expertise of their long-tenured workers. A senior workforce also means that when a plant closes or downsizes, 60% to 70% of the newly unemployed are older workers.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313214">One would think that successive governments might have assumed some responsibility for addressing the unique issues confronting older workers in Canada. Despite often lauding our incredibly skilled older workforce, they did nothing to ensure that these workers would remain a vital force in our economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313215"> To this day we do not have a manufacturing sector strategy for our economy. To this day we do not have an auto sector strategy. To this day we do not have a green industry strategy and we also do not have an industrial strategy. Instead, we allow foreign companies like U.S. Steel, Xstrata and Vale to buy up Canadian companies without an ounce of a guarantee that they will protect Canadian jobs. It is absolutely disgraceful.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2313216">Compounding the problem is the fact that this is the very government that did nothing to protect these jobs in the first place. It is the same government that is doing nothing to protect displaced older workers.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313217"> These unemployed Canadians need to keep working. They need a few more years of income before they can retire. They cannot cash in their retirement savings because that would be cutting off their noses to spite their faces. Surely, we cannot expect them to sell their homes or take out a new mortgage. These older Canadians have worked hard all their lives. They played by the rules and now, through no fault of their own, they have become incapable of building a secure future for themselves and for their families.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313218">It is time for the government to step up to the plate and offer real assistance to these displaced workers. Unfortunately, instead of setting up effective programs for worker adjustment, the Conservatives have been setting up barriers to re-employment instead.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313219">In the time I have left, I would like to talk about the health of older workers. </ParaText><ParaText id="2313220">To support our senior workers, we need to support their health and the health of their families. In addition to protecting seniors financial security through our pension proposals and increasing GIS, we need to look seriously and critically at the issue of health for older workers and retirees. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2313221">First and foremost, we need to tackle the issue of social determinants of health. People cannot be healthy unless they have a home to live in. We need an affordable housing strategy for this country. I am very proud that Bill <Document DbId="4327908" Type="4">C-304</Document>, our bill for a national housing strategy, is actually at committee and hopefully coming back for third reading soon.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313222">We need something like a pharmacare strategy to ensure that older workers, their families, and all Canadians have access to the prescription medications they need to stay healthy. We hear time and time again from pharmacists who tell us that every single day at least one person, often more, will come to the counter, put in their order for prescription medication, but when they get the package and look at the bill, they walk away and leave it behind. That happens every day.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313223"> In my old job as a community legal worker, I had clients who would often cut their pills in half or take their pills every second day. They simply could not afford the cost of the prescription to take their medication as prescribed.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313224">A universal pharmacare plan for all Canadians to access the drugs they need to stay healthy would be a definite support to older workers and their families. We can do it if we work with the provinces and territories to establish a Canada-wide prescription drug program.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="00">(1400)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2313225">Further, once older workers have finished working, we need to look at a system of home care and long-term care. It is much less expensive than acute care in a hospital and it makes good financial sense for supporting retired workers.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It states:</ParaText><ParaText id="2313229"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That, in the opinion of the House, the government should continue to recognize the vital role of older workers in the Canadian economy and ensure its labour market programs and policies encourage older workers to contribute their skills and experience in the Canadian workforce.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2313230">An important aspect of this is the recognition that people of my age have been in the workplace since the early 1960s and have contributed to the prosperity of this country, leading it to be the economically-envied country of the world of today. Many of us are quite capable of continuing to work for some years ahead.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313231">As has already been stated, many Canadians are choosing to stay in the workforce past what used to be considered the traditional retirement age. The reasons for this decision are as varied as each worker involved, but the one they have in common is the need for support from the Government of Canada.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2313232">Of note, some 110 years ago, just a little over a century ago, Canadian men had a life expectancy of 47. Today, that life expectancy is in the region of 78 years, considerably higher than it used to be a short 100 years ago. With that in mind, our government has already shown its commitment to older workers in Canada through programs such as the targeted initiative for older workers and the labour market development agreements we have signed with the provinces to provide assistance to older workers. </ParaText><ParaText id="2313233">Canadians know that with our government's strong leadership, Canada has weathered the recession better than any other G8 country. However, the economic recovery is not yet complete. We need to encourage all Canadian workers who are contributing to the economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313234">Older workers have, as the motion states, skills and experience that are essential to allow Canada to compete effectively in the global economy. They are also frequently, with the majority of their family responsibility commitments behind them, more flexible than younger workers in their scheduling hours and availability for overtime, if necessary. It makes sense that governments would offer support to these older workers to allow them to continue to contribute to the economy and the well-being of their families as long as they wish to do so.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2313235">It has been noted that honouring seniors is a tradition that is fading from some parts of our society. That is certainly one of the reasons that elder abuse has risen in recent years, particularly elder financial abuse. Our government is aware of that increase in elder abuse and working to combat it through a combination of education and criminal enforcement.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313236">As someone who would be considered to be an older worker, I suppose in a way I speak for all older persons who can contribute and want to continue to contribute to society, to their family's financial well-being, and who want to be reminded that there is still true value for this contribution.</ParaText><ParaText id="2313237">I urge all members to support this motion. Older workers are an important part of our economy and the House should stand with them, reaffirming their value, and offering support where necessary.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
