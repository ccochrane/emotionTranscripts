Since my election in 2004 I have only known one Speaker and that is yourself. It is good to see you back in the chair once again. It will be interesting to see how you deal with some of the challenges facing the House of Commons today.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246207">Let me also begin by extending congratulations to our fellow colleagues here who have been elected to the House of Commons. Some have been re-elected and are returning again. There are a considerable number of faces new to this chamber who will inject a new sense of lifeblood into the debates of our nation. Congratulations to all. </ParaText><ParaText id="1246208">It is a tremendous honour to be returned once again. I want to thank the good folks of the riding of Essex for expressing their confidence in me once again and also for making a bit of history.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246209">My election first in 2004 then 2006 and now again in 2008 makes me the first Conservative elected in three consecutive elections in my riding in over 75 years and only the second since Confederation. The people of Essex have decided to make a certain amount of history. It would be fair to read into the record the name of the last such member of Parliament to do that back home and his name was Eccles James Gott who did it in 1925, 1926 and 1930. It is good to follow in those footsteps.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246210">I also want to commend the good folks back home in Essex for their choice and their wisdom in choosing a member of Parliament with a seat on the government side of the House as opposed to the opposition because at this particular time our region is facing a number of challenges. My constituents recognize the value of having a seat on the government side of the House. It also demonstrates that there is some resonance for our platform as the blueprint for moving forward for our region. </ParaText><ParaText id="1246211">The City of Windsor is a neighbour to my riding and facing an unemployment rate of 10%. By returning me citizens are saying they want a partner in government who will be able to take the challenges of the region forward and look for solutions. </ParaText><ParaText id="1246212">I think it also is an expression of confidence in the leadership of our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his ability to steer us through what is widely acknowledged as tough global economic times with a lot of instability. That trust is well placed. </ParaText><ParaText id="1246213">Our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> is an economist and who better to understand economic trends with some amount of foresight and able to act proactively and pre-emptively in some cases to address those challenges. We have seen a number of proactive measures taken by the Prime Minister and the government over the last three years which have positioned Canada to best weather the storm.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246214">Our measures are now being replicated by other major countries. After reading the headlines today, I noticed that a lot of other major industrialized countries are now duplicating our measures themselves with only a couple of differences. </ParaText><ParaText id="1246215">First, these countries are doing it with the problem of mounting debt from ongoing structural deficits. We do not face that challenge here in Canada as we face these tough economic times. Second, these countries are doing it in response to the crisis rather than demonstrating foresight and getting out ahead of it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246216">What kinds of measures are we talking about? The United Kingdom, for example, made a 2.5% cut to its version of the GST. In a couple of successive budgets, our government has lowered the GST in Canada by 2% to help stimulate what has been a robust domestic demand for everything from automobiles to durable goods.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246217">In the United States, president-elect Obama has proposed an economic stimulus package. He is talking about everything from maintaining the Bush tax cut for the wealthy to extending tax relief to middle income and lower income Americans, and massive infrastructure spending. Some of this sounds a little familiar. </ParaText><ParaText id="1246218">In the last fall economic statement we had tax relief for lower and middle income Canadians, and tax relief for businesses and corporations. In two consecutive budgets we made historic investments to stimulate infrastructure projects in this country.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1246219">Essex is one of those sort of bellwether regions in Canada. It is often said back home that as Essex goes, so goes the nation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246220">For me, the win that we experienced in the last election was both a stronger margin of victory personally but also a demonstration of an increased mandate for the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the government to tackle some of these tough economic questions. It is a mandate, of course, that includes more seats in Ontario. Many people are pointing to Ontario as one of the tougher spots of the economy, with our region within Ontario being one of the more troubled spots in the province and yet there is an increased mandate for the government. There are more seats in south and southwestern Ontario, which is the manufacturing heartland. We are restructuring in the auto industry in particular but manufacturing in general has perhaps been affected most acutely.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246221">We have emerged through the election with a stronger mandate for the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the government, including these tough economic areas. I think we are seeing an expression of confidence in the Prime Minister to lead us through troubled times. </ParaText><ParaText id="1246222">If we look at the global landscape and some of the difficulties that are facing us, we see this is global in magnitude. I think we need to appreciate what we are facing. These problems started outside of our borders but they certainly affect us within our borders. The U.S. meltdown in the housing and financial sectors is the touchstone for what is becoming difficult global times. Canadians are resilient though. We believe in the ability of Canadians to band together, to demonstrate the typical resilience of Canadians to get through this.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246223">It is very much the same as the DNA of our folks back home in Essex. We have been through some very difficult times, some of it cyclical in terms of the nature of the boom and bust cycles of the auto industry and some of it dating back as far as when we were a frontier town, on a frontier landscape pushing railroads through and pushing trade through. Our people have demonstrated an ability to roll with the times, to come through the times and come out stronger on the other side of it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246224">However, we cannot escape the reality that tough economic times mean that we are dealing in human terms, both in terms of the opportunity side and with the types of opportunities we can create for real people. There are hard-working families and some family members are not working. We need to know the human costs of making the wrong decisions or right decisions or of acting or not acting.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246225">If we are looking at the human side of it there is one factor that we cannot control and that is American consumers who are exhausted or worse, bankrupt, which affects some of the demand for the products we build here. We are seeing layoffs and job losses in places like Windsor, Oakville and Oshawa as a result of it. It is tough times for families.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246226">I have come through some of that myself. For those in the House who do not know, I came off the assembly line at Chrysler Canada after just over six years. It was at a time when they closed the Pillette Road truck assembly plant where I was working and, of course, there was no government assistance at the time. It was at the beginning of some restructuring in the market. It was a time when we had just taken out our very first mortgage. I think it was about three months before that. I had never been in home ownership before. Our 10 year old vehicle had just stopped working and we were looking at a massive expenditure there, as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246227">Families are obviously living through those same types of things as we face tough times right now.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246228"> Canadians are rightfully concerned about their futures. We cannot take lightly their choice of who they have chosen for leadership in this. What is the vision forward? This is what brings us to our throne speech. It lays out some of the broad parameters for where the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the government intend to lead the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246229">I will address some of the criticisms I have been hearing in debate so far about the throne speech. One of the biggest ones we hear is that it is not prescriptive enough. People were looking for specific line items mentioned in a budget. They said that they were looking for this or that but did not see it so they will oppose the throne speech. We have a number of folks on our opposition benches who are hanging their hats with respect to their votes on whether their specific issues are mentioned in black and white in the throne speech. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1246230">The throne speech is a broad outline and it has taken a certain amount of flexibility precisely because we are in extraordinary circumstances with respect to the global economy. I think the experts will agree that we are in a global recession and perhaps heading for a depression that has not been seen in the lifetimes of most members in this House. Therefore, having a flexible throne speech that lays out a vision of where we are going without having to prescribe every single measure on how we are going to get there is important for the government moving forward.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246231">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, in terms of flexibility, also has said that he is looking for constructive measures from the opposition in terms of what the specifics will look like coming through this. It will not just be on the expenditures side in terms of coming up with what spending stimulus could be there, but also on the cost savings side. We will be looking for constructive measures from the opposition about where we can generate savings from things that perhaps are not working.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246232">We needed a flexible throne speech that was not overly prescriptive because we wanted some input from members on the specific tools to get there, including on the expenditure side. To simply take the position that the throne speech is not prescriptive enough and therefore it simply cannot be supported is the wrong approach.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246233"> I do not think anyone in this House can disagree with the five broad themes that have been laid out in the throne speech. I would encourage our members to support it. </ParaText><ParaText id="1246234">What are those five pillars and themes that the Governor General laid out on behalf of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>? One, of course, is that we are taking very seriously the foundational issue of reforming global finance. </ParaText><ParaText id="1246235">Two, we will deal with our own domestic foundation, which is to ensure that we have sound budgeting.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246236">Third, we will secure jobs for families and communities across Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246237">Four, we will expand investment in trade.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246238">Five, we will make government more effective.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246239">Let us examine those points a little more in detail, the starting point being reforming global finance.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246240"> Obviously the global economic turmoil we have been through started in financial markets in the United States. No financial system was immune from that. Our own financial institutions had some exposure to some of the sub-prime investments themselves and a number of countries around the world were woven into that. Putting the global financial system on a solid footing is one of those foundational things that had to be done. We saw it with the G-20 meetings where our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> laid out that Canada has a very good model to demonstrate to the rest of the world in terms of how we stabilize and handle our financial institutions. We will continue to take a leadership position to ensure the foundation of the global economy is sound.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246241">Domestically, regarding ensuring sound budgeting, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has been clear about what this will look like. We want to learn from some of the past mistakes. I was a student of history at university, which was my major. It is important to look back at similar situations in terms of economies that have happened in our history. If we look at the Great Depression, for example, in the 1930s, there are some very pertinent examples of measures that we should not duplicate because they will lead to the same result. </ParaText><ParaText id="1246242">We have an opportunity here to learn from the mistakes of history and one of those is by ensuring that we do not lock ourselves so rigidly into engineering a balanced budget or a small surplus just to say that we did it. That was one of the precursors that plunged the United States into a great depression, and others by extension.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246243">Instead, what the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has said very clearly is that we will focus on appropriate economic stimulus while ensuring that our investments in benefiting Canadians and Canadian families are maintained and do so while avoiding a return to the structural deficits of the past, that is the chronic overspending year over year over year. We want to ensure that we have sound budgeting while we are addressing some of the historical challenges ahead of us. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1246244">In order to secure jobs for families and communities, we will build on some of our past achievements. When we are talking about stimulus for our economy at this time, we are not just starting now to respond to the crisis. We have some past achievements from budgets 2006, 2007 and in 2008 already. For example, we have record infrastructure investments, historic, of $33 billion in the Building Canada plan, which is the most since the Great Depression over 60 years ago. </ParaText><ParaText id="1246245">We have provided help for communities in transition with the billion dollar community development trust fund earlier this year, which is a very significant measure. Ontario's share is $358 million over three years. Some of that money is already beginning to filter down into communities, like Windsor, which have been heavily reliant on the auto industry to help some in the parts sector diversify their businesses. Therefore, we are already seeing some of the first of that much needed money beginning to flow into some of our communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246246">Last February we announced our auto action plan, our four pillar strategy on how to address investment in the auto industry to catapult it forward, particularly into the area of green technology commercialization but research and development first and then commercializing it to help the auto industry retool its operations here in Canada to produce those technologies and the vehicles that will use those technologies here.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246247">We have already had the first example in terms of a proposed investment coming out of my region back home, right next door to Windsor, the Essex engine plant for Ford. The government announced an $80 million investment over five years to help, not only retool the operations to produce fuel efficient engines but to house and co-locate within the facility a green research and development centre investigating the next breakthroughs, not only in combustion engine fuel efficiency improvements but other alternate fuels and even down to alternate sources for power generation for its vehicles.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246248">It was announced in the election and talked about in the throne speech that we would sweeten the pot. We will improve the auto innovation fund with additional funds to help out the auto industry. We will also be building on our success of historic labour market agreements for retraining for those who find, in the restructuring that is going on, that they need to train for new careers. It means $1.2 billion for Ontario and that is for training people outside of the employment insurance stream. This is not dependent on whether one's EI benefits have run out. We have an additional stream where we are able to retrain and create a flexible, highly skilled workforce for the new opportunities in our economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246249">We will be building on historic settlement funding which has allowed us to unlock the potential of new Canadians to access not only the skilled labour markets but to unlock their entrepreneurial advantage for those who want to create businesses. In Windsor we have historic levels of funding to settlement agencies, including the new global business centre which is effectively a one-stop shop, turn key operation for new Canadians who come in with a business plan so they can know what the regulations are. All they need to worry about is actually executing their business plan. This makes it very simple for them. Those are job creators for the future as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246250">There are historic transfers to the provinces to address the historic fiscal imbalance question. It is important to look back. When the Liberals say that they balanced the budgets back in the early nineties, they may have turned the fiscal fortunes of the federal government around but how did they do that? They did that on the backs of the provinces, putting them in a very difficult fiscal position. Many of them never achieved a surplus position until our government this year. These types of transfers are helping them turn that around. The Liberals did it on the backs of seniors and other groups as well. It is not a good situation to have a federal government that is in a good position and have our provinces fiscally weak in all of those areas.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1246251">Today we have not the exact opposite, but we have healthy provincial coffers as we are heading into an economic storm and we have a federal government that has the flexibility to act.</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="30">(1030)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="QuestionComment" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Cannis" id="2558527"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128501" Type="2">Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1246252">Mr. Speaker, I congratulate you on your appointment.

I think it is important for members to stand in their places and be counted on whether or not they agree with this particular issue. If they have a differing opinion, let them speak on that.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246257">With respect to the automotive industry, this was a very significant investment decision. To give a little bit of the history on this, the auto action plan was announced in February and the budget which came out very shortly after that put the funds aside. Notwithstanding the opposition of some parties in the House and one party that did not vote on it, we did get those funds approved and set aside. That is approved money for the purpose of this investment.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246258">We had to wait for Ford to weigh in, in terms of its fiscal situation coming out of the second quarter, on whether it could still go ahead with the investment.

It is a very trying time for that industry right now.

Men and women who have good skilled trades are really concerned.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246271">One of the things we have not discussed is trade agreements. Market share is disappearing for the traditional three because of imports coming into Canada. We have the most open automotive market in the world.

My specific question for the member for <Affiliation DbId="128436" Type="2">Essex</Affiliation> is, which countries is the government looking at expanding trade with in terms of Asia? Is it back to South Korea? Hundreds of thousands of vehicles are shipped into Canada from South Korea and we do not ship any automobiles there, just farm equipment, and that is probably going to dissipate as well because we recently lost our only farming equipment manufacturer in Welland. </ParaText>

I think the member said that the throne speech refers to more free trade agreements. I am going to quote page 8 of the throne speech where it says, “New trade agreements will be pursued in Asia and the Americas”. It did not specifically say what type of agreements. </ParaText><ParaText id="1246277">To understand the philosophy of this government, there are two important things. I have heard the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> speak about two very important things with respect to the auto industry. The first is that we need to find ways to help the industry be more competitive against the rest of the world. We started with our auto action plan in that regard. The auto action plan proposes a number of initiatives, including helping the industry retool to produce products that are extremely competitive not only in North America but also globally.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246278">The second thing I have heard the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> say is very important is that deals are not going to be signed that are not going to guarantee us some access.

The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has been clear. First, we have no agreement in principle and the precise reason is that in the negotiations we do not yet have guarantees that we are going to get into their market. We have to have proven demonstrable access to their market before we will conclude agreements. That is the wise position to take. We have not been in a rush to conclude something that is necessarily going to expose our industries to further disadvantage. We want access to markets.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Unfortunately, I was disappointed. There was nothing that grabbed my attention or excited my imagination. More worrisome, I did not leave the Senate chamber with the sense that the government understood what it needed to do in the face of the current economic downturn. In essence, it confirmed my suspicion that the government's cupboard of ideas is bare.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246283">Handling an economic downturn is the most challenging task that any government can face. It has happened to my own party, just as it is now happening to the Conservative government. Experience tells us that to handle it well, we first have to recognize that it is happening. On that score, the government has clearly failed the first test.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246284">I need not remind members of the government's rosy pronouncements over the past year as the global economic situation deteriorated. Even during the recent election, it was somewhat surreal to hear the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> speak as though the economy were running smoothly on all cylinders. I am assuming he thought that was the case, which is even more worrisome.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246285">The second requirement to minimize the effect of an economic downturn is to craft one's fiscal policy to include the necessary buffers that would help one weather difficult times; they always happen at some point. Anticipating change is one of the responsibilities of a government. That of course requires that the government formulate its policies wisely, always keeping an eye on the future. </ParaText><ParaText id="1246286">Lowering the GST by 2% was not good fiscal policy and I am sure the government regrets that decision today. Spending like there was no tomorrow over the past two and a half years was also not good fiscal policy. Eliminating the $3 billion contingency reserve was even more reckless policy.</ParaText>

It demonstrated a long-term vision that was praised by all the universities and research hospitals in the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246290">It also created scholarship programs and grants to encourage greater post-secondary enrolment in our learning institutions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246291"> Finally, it proposed a national child care and early learning program that clearly recognized how critical early learning was to future development. </ParaText><ParaText id="1246292">These were far-sighted programs.

The result is that Canada is now a leader in university research among the G-7.</ParaText>

One of the issues I want to talk about restoring some dignity back into the fishery by way of licence buyouts and early retirement.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246325">The pulp and paper industry, as I discussed earlier, is a major issue for one particular town in my riding, Grand Falls--Windsor, which is now teetering on a big decision that we hope will work out in favour of the community and for the province in general. However, it looks like the company, particularly AbitibiBowater, will make a decision by year's end that could have a great impact on my riding. Hopefully it will not be detrimental. </ParaText>

In fact, in the last session, it was said that the deficit for the small craft harbours program, in other words, the money needed for all the harbour and wharf facilities across the country, remained at just less than half a billion dollars. Therefore, we have a long way to go.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246327">In the last election we committed an extra $100 million in addition to what had already been allocated in the past little while. We put in an extra $100 million several years ago, which the Conservative government has renewed indefinitely. I hope it will continue that. I press upon the government the importance of this program, not because it is a fish issue but because it is an infrastructure issue. If infrastructure is what we are talking about, particularly roads, highways, sewer treatment plants and the like, we have to be talking about small craft harbours as well, as they are very important part of the country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246328">The former deputy minister of fisheries and oceans, when he appeared before the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans, said, “The program needs $35 million per year in order to maintain the current infrastructure”, which gives us an idea of the situation in which we are now. There is an infrastructure deficit for the people who go out on the ocean.</ParaText>

However, to put this into context, what was needed at the time was a particular program for the forest industry, not just particular programs to get people over to other jobs. Indeed there are programs for transitioning someone from working in one particular job to working in another, but what about targeted incentives, subsidies, for companies to invest in the industry? The community trust fund does not properly address that aspect. </ParaText><ParaText id="1246334">We had a billion dollar fund that was going to do just that. </ParaText><ParaText id="1246335">I appreciate the fact that they want to put a billion dollars into transitioning people from work and want to make other investments of that type, but the problem is that the onus is now not on failing communities, but failed communities.

They were left out in the cold. As a result, they paid thousands of dollars in unnecessary income tax. Before the mistake was realized and an appeal launched, time had elapsed.

							<ParaText id="1246418"> It is with a considerable sense of honour and gratitude that I rise in the House today to deliver my inaugural speech in this 40th Parliament. I share the honour of several others in this House of continuing a family tradition. In my case, it represents a somewhat longer time gap. My family roots can be traced back to William Steeves, Father of Confederation. I know little detail of his motivations to join those founding this Confederation, except that he supported this historic union in the hope of providing good governance. That same goal was my singular reason for seeking election.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246419">I am deeply honoured to have been elected as the member of Parliament for the constituents of Edmonton--Strathcona. I am grateful to the countless enthusiastic Edmontonians, from ages 8 to 80 years, who came from every corner of my constituency and across the city to join my team in getting out the vote on election day. I am awed by the time and energy Canadian communities volunteer to our democratic process. It should be honoured.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246420"> I encourage all members of this House to not lose sight of the privilege we share in living in a nation where we can freely participate in the electoral process without threat of violence or corruption. It is no lesser a privilege that our affairs are dictated by the rule of law. We do well to recall that the very definition of a democracy is a nation governed by rules, made and enforced by those we elect, a government that remains open and transparent, where laws enacted by the majority are effectively implemented and enforced, including laws for the protection of our health and our environment.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246421">It behooves this House to be diligent in ensuring that the needs and interests of all Canadians are placed at the forefront of our minds when making decisions affecting their lives, their families, their children, their communities and their futures. My constituents did not just elect a new representative to speak on their behalf. More important, I have promised to doggedly pursue a more participatory democracy. I will pursue reforms to bring Canadians proportional representation to this House. I will also champion more constructive and inclusive means to ensure their direct engagement in the decisions affecting them. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246422">Nowhere is this more critical than in the hinterland. I have long advocated for the right and opportunity of members of the affected communities--farmers, trappers, fishers, first nations, Métis, immigrants and women--to have a seat at the table. This is the real democratic reform Canadians have called for.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246423">Now more than ever, as we face dire threats to our environment and mounting economic distress, it is incumbent upon us as members of Parliament to open the doors to our decision-making processes. If we are truly committed to seeking answers to climate change, to safe food and drinking water, to clean air and liveable communities, it behooves us to hear directly from and respond to those who bear the brunt of impacts downwind and downstream.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246424">It is my hope during this Parliament that we can move away from basing decisions on polls and hand-selected advisory groups. Our federal laws and policies will be strengthened when they are grounded in the voices of the communities most directly affected, when we engage Canadian communities in exploring solutions that speak to their special needs and circumstances.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246425">Canadians want their federal government to assert federal jurisdiction and powers. They have called for bold measures to protect our environment for the benefit of this and future generations. Strong federal laws are in place. Federal agencies and tribunals are mandated. As an advocate for federal engagement in these areas for over 30 years, both inside and outside government, I decry the announcement by the government of its intent to claw back the powers of these agencies and tribunals, to label the valid assertion of federal measures and powers as mere red tape.</ParaText>

This is what can be deemed a sensible policy for our time.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246433">For many, the retired, those on fixed incomes and struggling students, reducing energy costs is a necessity, not a frill.

It is a real honour to do that.

I googled the member for <Affiliation DbId="128339" Type="2">Edmonton—Strathcona</Affiliation> before I came to deliver my speech this morning and she is a powerhouse. She has an unbelievable background of experience in her own province of Alberta, nationally and internationally. I will share with the House a couple of things she has done.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246457">She held a senior portfolio as the chief of enforcement for Environment Canada. She founded Alberta's Environmental Law Centre. She served at the international level as head of law and enforcement for the North American Commission for Environmental Cooperation. She spent four years working with Canadian, American and Mexican officials. She served as a senior legal advisor to Indonesia, Bangladesh and Jamaica in instituting programs for effective environmental enforcement for CIDA, Asian Development Bank and World Bank funded projects. This is just the tip of the iceberg to indicate the contribution that the member will make in this place as she fulfills her role as environment critic for the NDP caucus and on behalf of our leader.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246458">I also want to say how pleased I am to be back in this place after the election. It was a tough and hard-fought election. We all worked hard. I dare say that the candidates who ran against me ran good campaigns. It was a clean election and one that we all came out of feeling better about the politics and democracy in this country. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246459">I am just happy that I was the one who came first past the post and that I am able to be here today to speak on behalf of my wonderful city of Sault Ste. Marie in the district of Algoma. It is a riding that is diverse in the ways people make a living and how they take care of each other as a community. It is very important. It is an industrial city with steel, paper and wood. To the east of the city, we have communities that are served by agriculture and farming, and to the north of the city we have the wonderful forestry which is in so much difficulty these days. It is an industry that we have taken advantage of, enjoy and love so much. Lake Superior is in our back yard.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246460">I want to take a few minutes this morning to share a few thoughts that were indicated in the Speech from the Throne, however so briefly, when the government indicated that it understood that it was elected as part of a minority Parliament. I present my thoughts in the spirit of co-operation, which is what I have heard from the government members across the way as they have given their speeches in response to the Speech from the Throne. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246461">In fact, I give my thoughts in the spirit of co-operation because the minister is here today. I will be the critic of that minister's department over the next however number of years that we get to be in this Parliament. When I approached her a couple of days ago to tell her that I would be her critic, she offered to work co-operatively with me and I thank her for that. I say very publicly this morning in this place that I offered to do the same in the interests of the people we all serve. My thoughts will reflect that in just a couple of minutes.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246462"> I think I would be remiss if I did not put on the record how disappointed I was with the vision presented in the Speech from the Throne and how disappointed collectively we as New Democrats were with that vision. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="55">(1155)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1246463">No bold picture has been painted as to where we might go as a country over the next couple of years, as we deal with this very difficult economic situation and global meltdown coming at us. We were disappointed with the stay-the-course, steady-as-she-goes, more tax breaks, less government approach to which the government seems so attached. We hope we can help it see some different approaches over the next while as we work together.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246464">Personally, because my critic area is poverty and social policy, I was very disappointed that there was absolutely no mention of poverty in the Speech from the Throne. As everybody knows, in a difficult economy and even in good times, when government makes a shift in a direction that reduces services, reduces government and gives tax breaks to people who are more wealthy, the people who are hit hardest and first are the poor in our communities.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246465">I say that in a spirit of hopefulness. Over the last few days, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has recognized that we might be heading into a recession. It is good that he is willing to say that very publicly, because he has not said that up until now. We hope, in recognizing we have a recession coming at us and the impact that will have particularly on those who are most risk and vulnerable, he will work with his treasurer, his <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>, and his <Affiliation DbId="128694" Type="4">Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development</Affiliation> to bring forward programs that will help those who need them most.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246466">I present a few strategies that could be adopted if the government is serious about working co-operatively with us on this side of the House. I invite the government to work with all of us in opposition to fix a few things that could immediately affect the lives of a number of our fellow citizens, neighbours, family members who are losing their jobs as we speak this morning because of the downturn in the economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246467">The government, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his ministers need to poverty-proof our communities. We need to stabilize our communities. We need to move away from the notion that somehow more tax cuts is the answer to everything. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246468">It is very easy because we have all studied it. We actually have studied it to death. The member from Nova Scotia who sits with me on the Standing Committee on Human Resources and Social Development will agree to this as well. We could do it today. We could move expeditiously to reform the employment insurance system, which, as we speak, only now serves to help less than 25% of those who lose their jobs. Hundreds of thousands of people who pay into employment insurance through their employment and work hard expect that fund will be there for them. However, when they apply for it, they find out that they do not qualify or if they do qualify, there is really very little there compared to what was there 10 or 15 years ago and what is there lasts such a short period of time. We need to move quickly. We are all committed to that on this side of the House. We invite the government to work with us to reform the EI system.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246469">I believe the money is there. If we are to be going into deficit spending anyway, we need to be spending money in those areas. Government has a no more fundamental responsibility than to look after those citizens in its jurisdiction who are most at risk and vulnerable. We could move, if we wanted, to use the money we have at our disposal to put in place a more generous child tax credit so families with children do not have to make those very difficult decisions of whether to pay the rent, feed the kids or put fuel in their tanks to heat their homes.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246470">I would ask the government to consider, again in keeping with the need to invest in infrastructure, a national housing program. When we talk to people who deal with poverty and look at poverty, the first thing they say is that we have a lack of affordable housing right now for people.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246471">I hope I have put on the table a few simple things on which the government could work with us. We on this side of the House are committed to making these happen. If it does, it will reflect the co-operation, good spirit and seriousness needed to deal with this very difficult time coming at us. We need to do something significant about it.</ParaText>

I hope that the Conservative government will recognize the importance of these issues and will immediately treat them as top priorities.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="1246490">The first and most pressing issue is Canada's ailing economy. In less than three years, the current Conservative government spent more money than it brought in. The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made the decision to leave no buffer, no room to manoeuvre to help to protect our country's finances in the event of an economic downturn.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="1246491">Canada is now in a vulnerable position, on the edge of recession. Canadians expect the government to present a plan to help our economy in these difficult times. This plan should protect Canadian jobs, houses, savings and retirement funds.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="1246492">Both the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> are trying to blame a global economic crisis for Canada's ailing economy. The truth is they must be held accountable for putting Canada on the brink of deficit. The current economic downturn did not start last month but nearly a year ago. We know that Canada had the worst performing economy in the G-8 for the first half of 2008.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246493">Canadians recognize that it did not have to be this way. Canada could have been better prepared by maintaining its reserve fund and investing wisely in increased productivity and creating jobs.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246494">What exactly happened to get us where we are today? In just two short years the Conservatives have squandered $12 billion in surplus that was left to them by the previous Liberal government. They also got rid of the $3 billion contingency reserve, their rainy day fund used for economic downturns which are here with us now. This is the money that could have helped Canadians in need by creating jobs, stimulating the economy, and addressing seniors' pensions without going into a deficit.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246495">It is also worth noting that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> currently heads the biggest spending federal government in Canadian history. It increased annual spending by $40 billion in just three budgets while at the same time generating less revenues than ever before, and called this good management.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246496">Let us not forget that just a day after the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> signalled pending public service cuts the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> increased the bulk of his cabinet by 20%. Now this sends a contradictory message to Canadians who are told that they have to have leaner, tougher times.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246497">Despite the increased size of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s newly minted cabinet, the three ministers responsible for regional economic development agencies, Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions, Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency and Western Economic Diversification have been reduced. They no longer have a minister. They now have a minister of state, which is a junior position. This is in the midst of an economic crisis where the regions of the country are most vulnerable.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246498">Of even greater concern to the people of my riding is the fact that the agency for northern Ontario, FedNor has been downgraded and absorbed into the industry portfolio. This is in addition to the fact that the Conservatives have slashed FedNor's annual budget by nearly $7 million since taking office. This serves as a clear indication that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his Conservative government eventually intend to scrap the program altogether.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246499">The importance of regional economic development programs such as FedNor cannot be overstated. An example of economic development that should be examined is North Bay's Jack Garland Airport. It is currently one of 15 public airports in Canada that boasts a 10,000 foot runway. It is often used as an official alternative landing when flights cannot land in Toronto or Montreal or other larger airports. This ensures safety for passengers and pilots, and it is an economic engine for present and future growth to the city of North Bay and the surrounding areas.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246500">Now the government wants to shorten the runway to 6,500 feet. It is worth noting that according to current estimates the cost of reducing the runway from 10,000 feet to 6,500 feet would be about the same amount. The financial change would be negligible but the real change would be a shorter runway that could not be used.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246501">This is a file that has to be examined. I am confident that in the end common sense will prevail and North Bay will keep its 10,000 foot runway for both the safety of Canadians and the economic growth of northern Ontario.</ParaText>

Canada is facing an infrastructure deficit of billions of dollars. We must invest at once in order to reduce this deficit, and we must partner with the provinces, territories, cities and communities. In these difficult economic times, we, the Liberals, understand that the government must allocate funds to the industries that increase our ability to compete and that also create decent, well-paying jobs for Canadians.</ParaText>

It was in fact a Liberal government that launched the first infrastructure program that created the new deal for cities and communities, which provided a GST rebate to municipalities and transferred the equivalent of 5¢ of every gas tax to municipalities for investment in infrastructure. We recognize that provinces, territories and municipalities need long-term predictable funding to eliminate the infrastructure deficit that faces the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246504">The government needs to provide better access to services that are essential to fight against poverty.

Unlike the Conservatives, whose ideology leaves no room for vulnerable Canadians, Liberals believe that when we invest in every Canadian, Canada succeeds, not only socially but economically.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246505">Also of grave concern is that the Conservatives have given no indication that they will reverse the cuts that they have made to the arts programs. Currently, there are about 1.1 million jobs that flow from cultural industries. Conservative cuts continue to undermine that important part of the Canadian economy. What is worse is that the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> has publicly acknowledged that the cuts were nothing more than political decisions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246506">The people of <Affiliation DbId="128394" Type="2">Nipissing—Timiskaming</Affiliation>, and indeed all Canadians, expect and deserve more when it comes to dealing with our current economic crisis.</ParaText>

It is very important for our economy despite the troubles that we have right now. We do need to have a new bridge replacement and a new plaza.

It is a little bit controversial because the Ontario Liberal government will not move ahead with a proposal to make it a greener project and although it is an insignificant difference it just seems to be stuck on not doing it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246514">Given the importance of the corridor and the fact that 40% of Canada's trade goes along the corridor and adding another bridge is very essential, not only just to Ontario and Quebec but the rest of the country with our GDP so tightly wound around basically a private American operator that owns the current bridge, why did his party take the position of objecting to the project going ahead?</ParaText>

Infrastructure is one of the areas where the more money we put into it, it will grow and stay in the country. What happens with some of the throw-away incentives from the Conservative Party is that people might get an extra $100 a month, but it often goes to products that are made abroad. So it helps retail a bit, which is important, but with infrastructure investment, there is money that gets built in and the money gets spent locally and is invested and reinvested. By the time it hits retail, it has actually expanded to more than the original investment. </ParaText><ParaText id="1246517">Part of that infrastructure really does have to take place and help trade across the border. When we look at the United States, it is our greatest trading partner. In this particular case, we have to do everything to increase trade and facilitate that trade, so that there are no barriers between the two countries. Increasing trade and allowing trade to go smoother is definitely something that has to be considered and improved upon as part of the complete infrastructure program.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We must remember that a surplus occurs in a government because of overtaxation. We have taken that money in surpluses and pounded it against the debt.

That has benefited Canadians from one coast of this country to the other.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246520">We also know that the fictitious contingency fund that members on the other side continue to talk about was only there to pay for Liberal pet projects which became a pet peeve of mine.

It is a humbling experience to be the representative of such a fine group of people that we have in <Affiliation DbId="128677" Type="2">Selkirk—Interlake</Affiliation>. </ParaText><ParaText id="1246564">Of course, to do the job as a member of Parliament, we could not do it without the support of our families. I need to thank my wife, Kelly, and our three daughters, Cortney, Taylor and Cassidy, for their love and understanding through the time it takes to be a member of Parliament and carry out these great responsibilities in representing everyone in our ridings, not only those who vote for us but every person who resides in our ridings.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246565">Getting elected is a tremendous undertaking and we could not do it without the support of volunteers. I need to thank my campaign team and the hundreds of volunteers who worked on my campaign to help get me re-elected.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246566"><Affiliation DbId="128677" Type="2">Selkirk—Interlake</Affiliation> is just a fantastic riding. I always say that I get to represent the best riding in all of Canada. I know everybody here thinks they represent the greatest riding in all of Canada but I can say that, aside from the fact that my rural riding is beautiful, I have the greatest people in all of Canada in my riding and that is what makes it the best riding in the nation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246567">My riding is a big riding with 91,000 people and 71 communities spread out over 56,000 kilometres. We have 10 first nation communities and 27 Métis locals. We have a real balance in European representation with Ukrainian and Icelandic descent, along with the original Selkirk settlers and the recent immigrants who have moved into our communities. It is a dynamic area that is always very exciting. Often, people do not realize that although it is a very large riding, a very agrarian riding with lots of ranching and farming, it also has the two great lakes of Manitoba, Lake Winnipeg and Lake Manitoba. We have some tremendous fishing on those lakes, both commercial fishing and sport fishing.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246568">The Speech from the Throne did focus in on the tough global economic crisis that we are facing. The news always focuses in on how it is impacting the auto sector, the financial sector and the housing market but we often forget about the importance of rural Canada. I do want to talk about how important that is. </ParaText><ParaText id="1246569">While we have this watchful eye on the manufacturing and service industries, we need to think about our agriculture industry, our fishing industry and other resource-based industries. Rural Canada is very important to the overall economic stability of this great nation. In 2006, there were 327,000 farm operators working on about 189,000 farms across the country. That is only 1% of the national population but that 1% makes a huge impact on the economy of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246570">On top of that, there are more than 52,000 people who are directly involved in commercial fishing in Atlantic Canada, on the Pacific coast and in the inland freshwater fishery.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246571">In <Affiliation DbId="128677" Type="2">Selkirk—Interlake</Affiliation>, there are 2,500 cattle ranches, over 2,000 mixed grain operations and 1,200 commercial fishers who are actively involved in the fishery on both Lake Manitoba and Lake Winnipeg.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246572">The Canadian fishery was very productive in 2000. It generated over $4 billion in revenues for the country. It has been increasing at a rate of about 2.8%, which is significant growth. In terms of trade, the fishery exported over $3.9 billion of commodities in 2007. Canada is the seventh largest exporter of fish and seafood. The value of the catch of the commercial fishery out of Lake Winnipeg alone, and this is freshwater fish, is $18.2 million. It has a number of spinoffs because of its importance. The inland commercial fishery is something that is very near and dear to my heart as well as supporting that fishery.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246573">We do have a small craft harbour program. The government, in the last session, increased the annual funding to the small craft harbour program to $20 million per year. Last year, we increased it another $10 million over the next two years to help deal with some of the small craft harbours that are in desperate need of repair and environmental cleanup.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1246574">In August of this year, I made a number of announcements for fishing harbours in my riding at Easterville, Arnes, Matheson Island and others to ensure that we deal with safety issues surrounding landing the catch and also ensuring that people have the facilities to get in and out without damaging their equipment.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246575">We are also putting money into the Lake Winnipeg water stewardship fund. This is important because we must protect the overall viability of our lakes. Lake Winnipeg is not only a major source of the commercial fishery but it is also a major source of freshwater in our aquifers. It is a major recharge for most of Manitoba and it also supports a huge tourism industry. Some of the nicest beaches in Canada are located in my riding.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246576">We have $18 million that has been put into the action plan for clean water just for Lake Winnipeg, to establish the Lake Winnipeg water stewardship fund. Out of that $18 million, a lot of that money is already starting to flow to help address the environmental issues that are surrounding the lake. We also established a $3.65 million fund to help community based organizations, industry organizations and municipalities to use those dollars to leverage against municipal dollars, provincial dollars and even other federal departments to look at reducing nutrient loading into Lake Winnipeg. This is for the entire basin, not just the inner lake. It is for Manitoba, Saskatchewan, parts of Ontario and Alberta that actually drain all the way into Lake Winnipeg. Over $1 million were set aside this year to deal with it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246577">The fund has five goals to reduce nutrient loading. First, we want to reduce the blue-green algae blooms. We want to ensure that there are fewer beach closings. We need to keep in place a sustainable fishery and provide a clean lake for all recreation and restore the ecological integrity of the lake.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246578">As I mentioned earlier, agriculture is a key economic driver in the Canadian industry. Eight per cent of Canada's gross domestic product is generated from agriculture which is equivalent to $86 billion. In Canada, agriculture generates one out of every eight jobs, which means that agriculture employs directly and indirectly 2.1 million people. That is all generated by 327,000 farmers who generate 2.1 million in this economy. Agriculture and agri-food exports in 2007 was $31.7 billion representing 6.8% of total exports.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246579">When we look at these spinoff benefits and job creation, we always have to ensure that we have strong agriculture policy. For every $1 of direct GDP created in primary agriculture, an additional $1.08 of GDP is indirectly created. For every job created in agriculture another, .91 indirect jobs are crated in the overall economy. We are talking truckers, people working in retail stores selling groceries and working in the food distribution system. For every $1 that we create in the GDP in the food processing industry, which is huge when we take a look at our packers and food processors, an additional $1.81 is created indirectly in the economy. Similarly, with food processing for every direct job created in the food processing it creates another 2.5 jobs in the economy. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246580">Agriculture is a significant driver and one that we cannot ignore, which is why this government has revamped our entire agriculture policy programs with Growing Forward. </ParaText><ParaText id="1246581">AgriInvest is a self-directed investment tool for farmers. It generates to help offset the top 15% of farm revenue. We provided over $400 million to kickstart those funds. </ParaText><ParaText id="1246582">AgriStability will continue to work with producers and promises to address the need of dealing with these short-term ebbs and flows in the marketplace and the cost of inputs. There will always be a need to change and revamp the program but we have made significant improvements to the old CAIS program and most farmers are thankful for that.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246583">We have AgriInsure, which is the old crop insurance program. We are looking at ways to improve crop insurance to make it more consistent across the country but also to deal with the challenges of trying to include the livestock industry under that.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246584">We have the great new program AgriRecovery to help offset disasters, things that are completely unpredicted and things that we cannot manage through any type of program except through some sort of ad hoc relief and working with the provinces to develop programs that address those needs.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246585">There will always be a need for improvement but I believe the <Affiliation DbId="111560" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food</Affiliation> is well aware of what programs will be best to deal with each individual disaster as they occur across this wide country.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1246586">In the last election, Conservative Party's platform talked about making even more improvements to agriculture policy. One improvement is setting up over $500 million over the next four years to deal with agriculture flexibility programs. I know some producers in certain areas of the country will say that is for certain risk management programs they might have within their own provinces. However, I personally see these dollars not tilting the playing field from one province to the next, but actually reaching out to help those commodities that are falling through the cracks, that are not best served because of long-term market conditions and have not been well served by current programs. It will reach out to things like livestock and horticulture that need a few more dollars to get along.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246587">We also announced that we will provide $50 million to increase processing and slaughter capacity in this country. That is especially important for areas where we do not see significant slaughter capabilities. If we look at packers in Manitoba, B.C. and Atlantic Canada, there is nobody to help support our livestock producers, especially under the current market conditions south of us. We need to have local packers and processors.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246588">We promised in the last election to cut the federal excise tax on diesel fuel in half, which will generate $47 million in savings just for farmers, and that is significant. I would like to take a little credit for it because in the 38th and 39th Parliaments I had a private member's bill in the House to eliminate the federal excise tax on any diesel fuel that is used in farming or in the commercial fishery. Two cents is a great improvement and it extends to everybody in Canada. I know my trucking friends are very happy with that promise.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246589">We also pledged to continue to work toward providing marketing choice to grain farmers across western Canada, which includes through the Canadian Wheat Board. We will continue to support and strengthen supply management in this country and carry its message strongly and clearly to any international discussions we have at the World Trade Organization.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246590">Despite all this government support, the sad fact remains that not only are the taxpayers of Canada providing support and subsidies to farmers but farmers are subsidizing the cost of food. If we look at the stats that I got from Statistics Canada, it shows that for small farms earning under $100,000 of revenue, 90% of farm income is derived from off-farm sources. When we look at large farms, 55% of their income is derived from off-farm sources. If we look at very large farms, and I am talking of farms with sales of over $.5 million of gross farm revenue, even in those situations 35% of their revenue is generated from off-farm income.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246591">Despite the support that is coming from the Government of Canada, to maintain a viable position somebody in the farm operation, and often it is both operators, must leave the farm and take jobs in town or generate some sort of other farm income through an in-home type businesses. Farmers are very entrepreneurial and resilient and they will look at whatever it takes to ensure they maintain their operations and land base.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246592">Yes, farmers may be asset rich but they are always cash poor. We know that the biggest challenge for farmers these days is not just managing the marketplace, animal health or trade issues. It is being cashflow managers. With the tightening credit crunch that we are seeing across this country and around the world, farmers will be in even more need for access to equity and dollars to ensure their farms continue to operate on a day-to-day basis.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246593">In the last Parliament, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="111568" Type="96">Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food</Affiliation> made significant movements and improvements to labelling in this country, especially when it comes to the issue of products of Canada. In the last session, I was pleased to chair the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food and we did a lot of great work as well in looking at some of the shortfalls in product of Canada labelling. </ParaText><ParaText id="1246594">Now we know that when people go into stores to buy a can of beans or processed food like pizza that says “product of Canada” on the label, it means that over 98% of the ingredients in that can or package is really from Canada. It is not just made in Canada, it is grown in Canada. Consumers can take a lot of refuge knowing that they are getting high quality and safe food because it is from right here in Canada.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1246595">We also know that in the instance where we process food here that is imported from other countries, they can still make use of the made in Canada label, which is important. We still want to create those jobs here and recognize that this food was processed under our inspection regulations and our environmental and labour standards. We know it has created jobs and opportunities in our country. We have to recognize that.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246596">We have also moved forward with biofuels, which is very important not only in helping the environment but also in helping our farmers, improving the market opportunity for our agriculture producers for selling some of their lower value grain stuffs, now also with cellulosic ethanol, being able to move some of our byproducts and biodiesel using some animal waste. That really creates extra revenue flows in farm operations and it is something that we will continue to support.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246597">I am disappointed that not all parties in the House support biofuels under the guise of the argument that it increases food prices. As a farmer, I will not stand here and advocate for cheap food policy. I want to ensure farmers can generate the revenues out of the marketplace so they do not have to get off-farm income nor rely on government subsidies to maintain their operations.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246598">That is why we have to continue to concentrate on trade expansion, ensuring that we have access to markets especially in these uncertain times with the World Trade Organization and not knowing whether we are ever going to get a final deal. Canada will go out and aggressively search out new markets to open the door for our agriculture producers and the entire Canadian economy for greater opportunity to market in higher valued markets around the world.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246599">As the <Affiliation DbId="128690" Type="4">Minister of Trade</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="111568" Type="96">Minister of Agriculture</Affiliation> have said, we will pursue the European common market. We will also pursue countries in Asia and ensure that we have as many doors open to us as possible.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246600">One of the challenges we have right now is the country of origin labelling from the United States. There is no question that COOL is a program that is in violation of both NAFTA and WTO. It is creating a great deal of uncertainty in the marketplace here, but more important, it is already driving down the market price. We are seeing cattle and hog prices plummet. We are seeing opportunities to sell in certain areas of the United States diminishing. We have to ensure that we take aggressive action against the United States on this very protectionist policy.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246601">The <Affiliation DbId="111568" Type="96">Minister of Agriculture</Affiliation> has already stated publicly that we will take trade action to ensure that the NAFTA rules are respected as it comes down to marketing product in the United States. When it is processed in the United States, it is a product of the United States. We also know it is in violation of WTO under the whole country of origin rules.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246602">I want to go back to the importance of our rural economy, our rural communities and our small towns in our ridings that so many of us represent. The percentage of people living in rural Canada continues to decline. In 2001, 20.3% of all Canadians lived in rural areas. That is only 6.1 million people. In contrast, 80% of Canadians now live in large urban centres.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246603">These small communities are supported by agriculture, the fisheries, forestry, the energy industry and the mining industry. We have to ensure we continue to support those communities.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246604"> There has been a lot of rhetoric floating around House about our cuts to corporate Canada. We have to remember that 98% of Canadian corporations are small and medium-sized businesses. These are the businesses are on our main streets. These are the cafés, the grocery stores, the pharmacies that are up and down our main streets, supporting our people who live in rural areas. They employ over 5 million people, just in small businesses. When we add in self-employed and the medium-sized businesses, two-thirds of Canadians are employed by small and medium-sized businesses. In 2007, 100,000 jobs were created by small business, accounting for over 40% of all jobs created in Canada. Despite all the rhetoric about cutting taxes, those tax cuts benefit our local communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246605"> I look forward to this time in the House. It is always great to be back here. I am proud of the work we have done as a government in bringing forward the issues of rural Canada. In developing policies in the 40th Parliament, we need to ensure that we do not forget rural Canadians, our farmers, our fishers and everybody who lives in the rural areas.</ParaText>

I agree with him, but I want to remind him and members absent from the House at that time, it was a city member, the former Liberal Member of Parliament for Toronto—Danforth, Dennis Mills, who made Canada aware of the family farm. It took a member from the city of Toronto to bring attention to the importance of our farming communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246609">I agree with the member that we need these products and that there is an importance we should attach to the farming communities. However, a vast number of the population lives in cities like Toronto, Montreal, et cetera. We consume so much of what they produce. Our cities today are hurting. Under the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the previous administration, now my city of Toronto and my former city of Scarborough, now part of the Greater Toronto Area, are hurting because infrastructure money is not coming in, jobs are in jeopardy and the list goes on. </ParaText>

From where I sit, we see all the support going into the big cities and we do not see enough coming our way. When we look at the infrastructure being invested, especially into the major urban centres, we see a lot more dollars being spent than what we are seeing spent in rural Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246612">There has always been this argument. Do we look at funding from the standpoint of a per capita basis, or do we look at it from the standpoint of need? Need is very subjective in the eyes of the beholder, but by basing it on per capita all the dollars are going to flow into urban centres where 80% of Canadians live. I made that fact known today. </ParaText><ParaText id="1246613">We have to address the issue of ensuring that the economy functions overall and that Canadians are getting the services they need. This is one of the reasons I jumped into political life. I am a cattle farmer. That is what I do for a living. I ran a small business in livestock export as well. I moved cattle around North and South America to our various clients. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246614">The real issue is that rural Canadians are not second-class citizens. We have to ensure we have the same level of service from financial sectors, infrastructure and service from government that is available to people in urban centres.

One of them was about championing local initiatives and about maybe having a federal procurement policy to buy locally for federal institutions and prisons. This recommendation was supported by all members of all parties on committee. Yet when we took this suggestion to the government and the department, we were told we had to be careful of trade obligations.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246619">How can we advance the role of local food initiatives and local food supply and support local farmers when we have this cloud of trade obligations?

He pointed out that there were obstacles to all the local food initiatives, one of them being the meat inspection regulations in British Columbia, which prohibit a farmer from selling from his or her farm gate to someone else. Even in my area in the Slocan Valley a lot of farms have been shut down because of that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246621">How can we on the one hand ensure we have good quality food at the multinational level or the corporate levels and not get any more unfortunate incidents?

Thanks to those leaks, we were kept up to date throughout the day about decisions made during the meetings.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246637">The first decision was made following a debate, and I was very disappointed to learn that it was about Resolution P-207, a resolution that reopened the abortion debate.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246638">Then another resolution was passed and it stunned me completely. The resolution called for equal pay for equal value. It did not stipulate equal pay for work of equal value. What a giant step back for women.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246639">All day long, we heard about similar kinds of resolutions. We could not believe it and wondered what was happening. We were anxious to see what was really happening and to get to the plenary meeting, which we were told we could attend.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246640">When we left Winnipeg—I left on the Sunday morning—I knew this government would do no more for women than it has done over the past two and half years. The rights of women in Canada and Quebec have suffered a terrible setback.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246641">This was confirmed last week when the World Economic Forum, which is based in Geneva, announced that Canada now ranks 31st out of 130 countries that were assessed based on whether the gender gap is increasing or narrowing. In 2006, we were ranked 15th. In 2007, we were 18th and now in 2008, 31st. It will not stop there. This is not surprising. We saw the cuts to Status of Women Canada; we saw the cuts to the court challenges program; we saw the changes to the Women's Program at Status of Women Canada, which made funding available. This will not stop here.</ParaText>

There is not a word about that in this throne speech. Evidently, because last time around nothing was accomplished. They only talked about it, nothing was done, they did not take action and things have not changed.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246644">In times of economic uncertainty such as these, when we do not know what will happen in two or three months—because things are changing so quickly and there is a new surprise or disappointment every day, and something else turns up each day—a government must make investments that will yield the greatest return. It must invest in people, in infrastructure, invest in what will yield a return as quickly as possible.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246645">This government could not be bothered to come up with a social housing plan, when there is $8 billion available in the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation fund. This government could not be bothered to make changes to employment insurance so that seniors who lose their jobs have access to a program that will help them transition into retirement after stopping work.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246646">This government also could not be bothered to change the eligibility criteria for employment insurance. Yet there is currently $44 billion in the employment insurance fund, money that could be used to help the people who earned this money and invested it in an employment insurance fund, so they would have something to fall back on if they were to lose their jobs.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246647">When we want the economy to run smoothly, we invest in infrastructure. Of course, the Prime Minister told us that he would invest in infrastructure, but between saying and doing, between talk and action, months go by and nothing is done. We have already thought about programs that should be put in place immediately, and not in three months come budget time.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246648">The situation with the economy requires us to start thinking about people and the economy and to invest now where it is most important. Infrastructure projects are a source of many jobs and opportunities, and this would ensure some short-term jobs, which would get the economy rolling.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246649">Furthermore, if a woman loses her job and is not eligible for employment insurance or welfare benefits because she has assets, then she is really out of luck.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246650">The Speaker has informed me that I have only one minute remaining. I do not know which direction to take, because I have so much to say about what is lacking in this throne speech. There is so much to say about this government's lack of social conscience. The word “equality” was even removed from Conservative Party documents. They did this at their convention last week. This goes to show the ongoing contempt that this government has for women.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246651">I am not wrapping up on a very encouraging note, but I certainly hope that the government will show some openness this time and try to go a bit further towards fixing the mistakes it has made in the past.</ParaText>

As a woman and a parliamentarian, I am thrilled to see a woman occupy the chair, particularly a francophone from western Canada. You will hold office with all the dignity for which you are known. </ParaText><ParaText id="1246664">I would like to thank the voters of Trois-Rivières for their trust and for electing me for a third consecutive term. I am very pleased to be here, in this chamber. I wish to congratulate all the members elected in the recent election. It is a pleasure to work together.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246665">Three things, among others, stand out in this Speech from the Throne. It completely ignores the concerns of Quebeckers regarding the uncertain economic situation and the current financial crisis. This throne speech in no way defends the interests and values of the Quebec nation. We need only cite a few examples. The Conservative government intends to diminish Quebec's authority in the area of finance—with a national securities commission—and is following through with its young offender legislation. The Conservatives have not understood the message delivered by Quebec voters on October 14. The Conservatives continue to impose their right-wing political ideology.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246666">As the natural resources critic, I wish to comment on the federal government's intention of promoting nuclear energy as clean and renewable energy. The throne speech illustrates this government's interest in developing Canada's nuclear industry. For this government, nuclear energy is as environmentally friendly as hydroelectricity or wind energy. Of course that is not true. Nuclear energy is quite dangerous and the consequences for the environment will be a burden for future generations.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246667">Furthermore, the federal government supports and promotes this industry's development. We should remember that it is a shareholder in a company that builds nuclear power stations and at the same time it is the guardian of public and environmental safety. The government is responsible for the industry's safety regulations through the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. Hence, the government currently finds itself in a difficult position, almost a conflict of interest. The Bloc Québécois believes that the government should not promote nuclear power. The previous minister of Natural Resources led us to believe that his government might provide financial assistance for the construction of a nuclear reactor in Ontario. This would mean that the government might help fund Ontario's electricity grid whereas it never supported Hydro-Québec.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246668">Furthermore, in 2009, the Nuclear Waste Management Organization is supposed to submit a proposal for the selection of a community willing to take in and store nuclear waste. The Bloc Québécois will ensure that Quebec does not become Canada's garbage dump for radioactive waste. Quebec opted for hydroelectricity, a clean and renewable energy. Quebec has nothing to gain from the federal government's decision to promote nuclear energy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246669">In addition, regarding bulk water transfers, unlike the Conservatives, the Bloc Québécois maintains that water is not excluded from NAFTA and that strengthening federal legislation is not enough. This could jeopardize Quebec's water resources, despite the government's indication in the throne speech that it intends to bring in legislation to ban all bulk water transfers or exports from Canadian freshwater basins. I would also like to point out that water is a natural resource that falls under Quebec jurisdiction and that Quebec has its own regulations regarding water.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246670">That is why the Bloc Québécois believes that the federal government must limit its legislative measures to the water over which it has jurisdiction and that a general legislative ban at the federal level could be disputed under NAFTA.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1246671">The federal government should exclude water from NAFTA and, therefore, the Speech from the Throne does not respond to the questions raised by this crucial issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246672">During the last Parliament, I had the privilege of being our party's industry critic and I rose on many occasions in this House to express the concerns of all stakeholders in the manufacturing and forestry industries, including the workers and their families, as well as businesses and communities that depend on the forest. Everyone is worried about the difficult situation those sectors are facing. In particular, thousands of jobs have been lost in my riding of Trois-Rivières and in Mauricie. Trois-Rivières' economy was founded on pulp and paper, and the situation is serious. We believe the government must act.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246673">With the throne speech, the government had the opportunity to demonstrate that it intends to help those sectors, but once again, it offers nothing for the manufacturing and forestry sectors. It does not offer a single concrete measure to help workers and businesses get through this crisis. There is nothing new for the forestry sector, which has been in a crisis situation for several years now.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246674">Yet the Bloc Québécois had repeatedly suggested numerous ways to revive that sector. We suggested creating financial tools to encourage companies to invest and modernize, such as loan guarantees to help companies modernize. We suggested that the government provide better tax support for research, development and innovation by making R and D tax credits refundable so that businesses could benefit from them until they made a profit. We proposed paying special attention to the regions that are being particularly hard hit by the current crisis and desperately need to diversify their industrial base to counter the forestry crisis. We suggested creating a program to support the production of energy and ethanol fuels using forest waste. We proposed that the government move quickly to impose absolute targets for greenhouse gas reduction in order to promote the establishment of a carbon credit exchange market. We suggested using government procurement as an economic development lever. Most importantly, we said that the government had to support workers hit by the crisis, by making substantial improvements to the employment insurance program, increasing benefits, basing the benefit calculation on the best 12 weeks, eliminating the waiting period and reducing the minimum number of insurable hours needed to qualify for benefits to 360. We also proposed an income support program for older workers. Such a program would enable workers aged 55 to 64 who cannot be retrained and who are victims of massive layoffs to bridge the gap between employment insurance and their pension fund.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1246675">The Bloc Québécois has repeatedly proposed measures to help workers and companies in hard-hit industries. To us, the message Quebeckers sent on October 14 should have been clear. The forestry and manufacturing sectors are mainstays of Quebec's economy, and the Conservative government's laissez-faire attitude is no longer the best option in these troubled times. The government must work with the members elected under the banner of the Bloc Québécois and draw inspiration from our innovative ideas to spur economic development.</ParaText><ParaText id="1246676">If the government should decide to go into deficit to resolve the crisis, it must not just take the often dogmatic approach of reducing taxes, as this has negative effects such as reducing flexibility during difficult economic times. The government needs to intervene in the economy in such a way that the forestry, manufacturing and other industries can weather the current economic and financial crisis. Right now, judging by the throne speech, the government seems to want to take advantage of the economic slowdown to impose its right-wing reforms on the machinery of government.</ParaText>

Everyone in the House, and indeed the millions of Canadians we represent are aware that times are tough. On the doorsteps and on the streets in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="128563" Type="2">Newton—North Delta</Affiliation>, there is a deep sense of concern about our economy that I have never seen before. There is a great unease about the future of people's jobs, people's savings and the ability to pay for post-secondary education for their children, or to build a comfortable nest egg for their retirement.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247001">In this period of such global instability, Canadians want to know that they have a government that prepares for a rainy day. They want to know that they can count on the federal government to guide them through the tough times.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247002">Unfortunately, with the performance that we have seen by the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> over the past few years, we now find our nation in a bigger hole than need have been. This situation is a direct result of the government's short-sighted fiscal policies.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247003">The Conservative government inherited a $13 billion surplus from the previous Liberal administration. In three shorts years it increased federal spending by a shocking 25%, over $40 billion per year, making it the highest spending government in Canadian history. It eliminated the $3 billion contingency reserve that the Liberal government had put in place for an economic downturn such as the current one. It got rid of $12 billion in revenue by cutting the wrong tax, a move which every economist in the country, except the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, warned against doing. This last point is something I would like to emphasize, because this is money that could have helped Canadians in need. It is money that could have created jobs. It is money that could have been invested in the struggling B.C. forestry industry or other sectors. It is money that could have been used to address seniors' pensions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247004">Now, in spite of promises on the campaign trail not to go into deficit, that is precisely what the government is planning on doing.</ParaText>

The answer to this is that the Conservatives just did not listen.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247008">How can the government justify a deficit in the coming year when it is also raising spending by $10 billion?</ParaText><ParaText id="1247009">What is worse is that as recently as this past Monday, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> told Canadians that this week's financial update would “not include any major moves meant to stimulate the economy”, which makes me ask, what is it going to take for the Conservatives to wake up to the reality that surrounds them?</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="10">(1510)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1247010">As mentioned last week, the Liberals will not bring down the government on the Speech from the Throne, not only because it would be irresponsible but also because the throne speech lacks any kind of detailed plan for action, making it as empty as the broken promises the Conservative government has made for the past three years.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247011">Canadians want an idea of what the government is going to do for the economy. What they do not want are big promises about a tough economic situation that has largely been caused by bad government decisions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247012">Before I conclude, I want to point out one glaring omission within the Speech from the Throne. There is little mention of our senior citizens, many of whom are going to be hit the hardest by this financial crunch. Over a third of the nation’s elderly live in poverty on basic old age pensions and public supplements. There are a number of steps that the government could take immediately to ease the economic anxiety for seniors, including giving them more flexibility when they need to convert RRSPs into RRIFs.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247013">It is shocking that seniors are being left to go it alone because of a government that is so desperately trying to cover up its past mistakes.

He has changed his mind because he realizes that personal and corporate tax reduction will help stimulate the economy, which our government started more than two years ago.

In fact, people must have more in their take home pay for us to have an economy that is stimulated. The Liberals have a great record. During their tenure, people had 11% more in their take home pay after paying taxes. The business taxes were reduced from 29% to 17% or 18%. The government came into power three years ago and raised personal income taxes from 15% to 15.5% and then still claimed it was reducing taxes. I hope the member was watching that budget. In the second budget, the Conservatives lowered the tax rate from 15.5% to 15%, to the same level, and yet still said they were reducing taxes. </ParaText>

Larry Bagnell (Yukon, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1247026">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the constituents of Yukon for again putting their faith in me and electing me to this Parliament for the fourth time. It is a great honour and I am very humbled by it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247027">However, at the doorsteps of this election campaign, for the first time in any in which I have run, there was a new ribbon running through the comments I was getting and that was one of great concern. People were very worried about their future, their homes and their pensions, to the extent that some people were actually very scared about what might come and the uncertainty.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247028">Then, in this crisis that is facing Canada, we have a throne speech that basically has no prescriptions to deal with it. In fact, I would ask Canadians listening out there, who I know told their politicians and canvassers throughout the campaign that they were worried and scared, if any of them feel any comfort after reading that throne speech? I would be happy to hear from any Canadian who felt comfort after reading the throne speech, Canadians who saw their RRSPs fading away, who get their monthly pension statements, people who are so vulnerable because their working lives are finished. They cannot increase their savings, and as their pensions fade away, there is no hope except here in this House and what we could do for them.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247029">They are worried about their homes with a possible recession. They are worried about unemployment, whether they can keep their mortgages, and whether they will be able to support their families. I would ask anyone to sincerely tell me what was in that throne speech that would give comfort to those people.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247030">I predict the new spirit of conciliation will last about two weeks in this Parliament, for one reason because we may be acting honourably but we certainly should not give up our principles to fight when the needy are detracted from or not supported, or there is an inappropriate justice strategy. However, in the spirit of conciliation, I would like to speak about some things in the throne speech that I appreciate and support. </ParaText><ParaText id="1247031">One of the items was the democracy promotion agency. I am not sure where that came from. It seems an antithesis of a government that had apparently decreased efforts in that area, certainly decreased our foreign presence, but all of a sudden we have this idea, which if it is what I believe it is, I am very supportive of and have wanted for a long time, which is that Canada has the expertise to intervene in world affairs, to develop democracy around the world, of course with our aid and military where necessary but also with our democratic skills.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247032">We among all nations have such strong diasporas from around the world, and have the abilities and understanding to know that it is not necessarily our way or the highway. We have a great understanding of what can work around the world, what people might want, and how we could help promote democracy in unstable situations. If that were to come to fruition, I would certainly highly commend the government on that initiative.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247033">I am also in support of increasing the incentives for energy-saving home retrofits. This is a program that was brought in by the Liberals. When the Conservatives came in, they cut it drastically, reduced it, and made it much harder to apply for. Now they seem to have reversed that and once again are increasing our excellent program. I am very happy for that.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247034">Another one of our programs where there was much uncertainty was the homelessness partnering program. We started that a number of years ago and that was very successful in my riding. There was a huge uptake and very apropos to the needy. It was very successful. In the last Parliament, I and others lobbied that this had to continue because the funding was very close to expiring. Fortunately, the government has listened and has continued that program.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247035">I was also happy to see the mention of a northern economic development agency. Members can rest assured that we will be in the north, watching very carefully to ensure that that promise is maintained and fulfilled, unlike a number of promises that have been broken by the Conservatives.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="25">(1525)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1247036">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s promise of three icebreakers was broken and reduced to one. The ice strength and supply ships are gone. The planes promised for the north have been cancelled.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247037">I am happy to see the government has listened to all the other parties that wanted a cap and trade system. Once again, we will be watching for the implementation of that.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247038">I am also happy to see the cutting of red tape for NGOs. I have had a number of complaints from NGOs that the government in power has made it increasingly difficult for them to get their funding through huge bureaucratic processes. We have to remember that a lot of these NGOs primarily employ maybe one or two people. They are mostly run by volunteers. They have huge complicated tasks of helping people and have sufficient problems in just existing. It does not do any of us any good for their time to be spent on unnecessarily bureaucratic application processes and reports. I am glad the government will move to deal with that problem, part of which it has created.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247039">Another area I am very happy to see is the area for which the member for <Affiliation DbId="128252" Type="2">Pickering—Scarborough East</Affiliation>, I and others have lobbied for a number of years, and that is increased provisions for the competition agency so it can be more effective in ensuring consumers of Canada get better treatment.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247040">I was not happy with a number of things. The Conservatives did not bring back a petroleum monitoring agency. Canadians are very concerned about gas prices and home heating fuel, especially in the north. We had initiated an office to watch and control this very carefully so consumers could have information on what was happening and companies could be watched. The government closed that office and it did not bring it back in the throne speech.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247041">A number of things related to the north, which had been talked about in previous times, all of a sudden seem to have vanished. Because of lack of details, a problematic mention of a regulation change was the only real reference to the north. I hope there is still a commitment to Arctic science, especially after we made the huge commitment, one of the best ones in the world, to the International Polar Year. I hope the government will follow up and continue the suggestion of a continuing Arctic science.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247042">I was very disappointed not to see any mention related to potential credit card increases in these desperate times. Apparently all the retail associations in Canada are up in arms that the merchants may be charged higher rates and individuals, if they miss a payment, may be charged higher rates, as if credit card rates are not high enough. Why would the government not take a strong stand against this in such a time of economic crisis?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247043">I also hope the government will rescind its notice of a couple of years ago that allows certain dumping in the Arctic. I have a private member's bill to stop that if the government does not.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247044">I was also disappointed not to see anything specific about a search and rescue plane fleet. I hope it was in the military announcement. It has to be renewed to protect Canadians. I have been lobbying for a number of years to put some planes north of 60 for the first time.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247045">There were seven items in the throne speech where it talked about the provinces and the federal government, but it did not say territories, which included work on the economy, common securities regulator, foreign credentials and international standards, education, international trade barriers, cap and trade and opting out of federal programs. Certainly northerners, like anyone else, want to be involved in those discussions. I was very perturbed to see those omissions in the throne speech.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247046">Finally, we have come through a time when we had a rising tide and our efforts were to ensure that the rising tide affected all ships. Even the poor were included. Now we have changed the whole scenario and we have a tide going down. When the tide is going down, who is going to be the first to hit the bottom, to have the danger of crashing on the bottom? It is those least able to afford it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247047">When the tide was flush, the government cut the most vulnerable, the aboriginal people, people who could not defend their rights, women and literacy. What is going to happen when there are fewer resources? The tide is going down and those people are going to crash first. All Canadians should be very concerned about that.</ParaText>

							<ParaText id="1247074">To start, it is important to note that Canada leads the G8 in economic performance. The reason Canada is leading the G8 is because of our government's commitment to lower taxes, a balanced budget and our aggressive paydown of the national debt. We have paid down $37 billion of the national debt in just the last two years. While other nations have been engaged in deficit spending, Canada has been spending within its means and delivering nearly $200 billion in tax relief to Canadians, including nearly a 30% cut in the GST. This prudent approach to our nation's finances has allowed all Canadians to benefit, even during these uncertain economic times. Not only are taxes lower, but unemployment is at historic lows, as are interest rates, and inflation is under control.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247075">Canada remains a great place in the world to invest.</ParaText>

Already our government has invested $100 million a year in apprenticeship incentive grants to encourage more young Canadians to pursue skilled trades careers.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247080">As well, we have provided a total of $200 million a year in tax credits, that is up to $2,000 per placement, to encourage employers to hire apprentices.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247081">We have also committed $3 billion over six years for new labour market agreements with the provinces to assist those who do not currently qualify for training under the employment insurance program. </ParaText>

Our government has recognized the potential created by increased trade across the Pacific and has invested over $1 billion in the Asia Pacific Gateway initiative to grow and modernize our west coast ports.

In fact, strengthening our economic union is more important now than ever, given the current global economic uncertainty.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247108">We do not have to look far to see the positive impact that labour mobility can have on a national economy. Our major trading partner, the United States, eliminated most barriers to trade and labour mobility many decades ago and has long experienced economic growth that has outstripped ours as a result.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247109">Reducing barriers to internal trade is not the only way our government can give the economy a boost. As a former small businessman, I know that red tape also costs our economy and results in lost productivity. Time spent filling out forms, reporting to government to obtain various licences means time not spent serving customers, producing products and creating value for shareholders.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247110">Our government is intent on streamlining the way it does business and is committed to reducing the administrative and paper burden on Canadian businesses. Our current goal is a 20% reduction in the paper burden, but we have already taken other actions to save businesses time and money.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247111">For example, we have already eased the tax compliance burden on businesses by reducing record-keeping requirements for automobile expense deductions and taxable benefits. We have also launched the new BizPal service in many municipalities across Canada, including in Surrey and White Rock in my community. BizPal allows businesses to quickly obtain all the forms and licences they need to comply with the requirements of every level of government with an efficient visit to a single website.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247112">The throne speech also outlined another way our government will give the economy a boost through the creation of a national securities regulator. In a time of global economic uncertainty, investors are looking for stability and security.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247113">Foreign investment in Canada means jobs for Canadians and growth in the economy. While Canada is already an attractive investment destination, greater certainty is provided to potential international investors by a single national standard for securities regulation rather than numerous different provincial standards.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247114">We will work with the provinces to put in place a common securities regulator. I note that financial institutions in Canada already benefit from the existence of a national financial institutions regulator. A common securities regulator will allow Canada to respond swiftly and efficiently to any developments in the financial sector and to speak with a common voice.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247115">Some of the advantages of a common securities regulator would be reduced compliance costs for companies offering securities and improved enforcement. Canada's lack of a national securities regulator has been identified as an area for reform this year by both the International Monetary Fund and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247116">Our government recognizes that lasting prosperity for Canadians comes through entrepreneurship and sheer hard work. Government does not create jobs, but government can help to create and support an economic environment in which those jobs will be created by the private sector.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247117">Another way we are helping to support job creation in the private sector is by extending the benefits of maternity leave available to other workers, to self-employed business owners through the employment insurance program.</ParaText>

No longer will the self-employed have to consider giving up their business ventures in order to raise a family. Instead, they may keep their businesses going for the benefit of their families and the other workers they employ. I have already heard from many small business owners in my community who are very enthusiastic about our plan. </ParaText><ParaText id="1247119">As well, the throne speech recommits our government to legislation that would provide better oversight of food, drugs and consumer products. The legislation would strengthen the power to recall products and increase penalties for violators. Our 2008 budget provided nearly $.5 billion over five years for the food and consumer safety action plan and to support the legislation we will be bringing forward.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247120">We have all seen news items in recent years regarding unsafe food, health or consumer products, including toys. As the father of a two-year-old, I can assure everyone that I am personally concerned about the food my daughter eats, the medicine she may take and the toys she may play with. Reports of melamine in imported food products or lead in paint in children's toys worry parents like myself.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247121">Our legislation would ensure that federal inspectors have the power to enforce standards that parents can have the confidence in. Protecting and promoting the health and safety of Canadians, their families and communities is of paramount importance to our government.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247122">The secure and efficient flow of goods, services and people is also essential to a trading nation like Canada.

We recognize that we live in uncertain economic times and stickhandling our way forward is a major challenge for our government. As I already mentioned, our prudent approach to fiscal policy since forming government has left Canada in an enviable position compared to other developed nations during this challenging time.</ParaText>

However, although he is worried about climate change—having participated in a meeting where many countries were worrying about the future of our planet—the Speech from the Throne still does not mention anything that would lead us to believe that the current government is worried about the situation.

I am sure he has heard it mentioned here more than once, but in case he has forgotten, I want to remind him that as was mentioned in the throne speech, we have a plan, the first plan in Canadian history to address the problem of climate change.

In northern Manitoba, communities that depend on the forestry industry were and continue to be affected as a result of the softwood lumber deal. Mining communities as well as future development across the north have been impacted by the economic downturn. There are also communities that have very high rates of unemployment and have seen the destruction of traditional economic activities.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247162"> Along with our concern for the economic well-being of Canadians, we also need to look at their fundamental needs that are not being met. Let me turn to the issues for my riding of Churchill. </ParaText><ParaText id="1247163">In terms of health, we need to look at the shortage of doctors and nurses all across northern Manitoba and across the northern and rural regions of Canada. We need a strong national strategy that assists the provinces in providing the health care that all Canadians deserve. We need to recognize the health needs of first nations where there are high rates of conditions and illness, such as diabetes and tuberculosis that reflect the third world conditions many first peoples encounter. This is unacceptable.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247164">In terms of education, we need to see significant funding increases. As a former instructor for the University College of the North, we need to support institutions such as that one. We need to see an increase in post-secondary funding for first nations students. We talk about education being key; let us step up and make sure there is adequate support for it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247165">We need to look at primary education on first nations and the increase in spending required for aboriginal education, which is far below the provincial average. We need to look at the building of schools, such as in St. Theresa Point where there is a need for a new elementary school, in Nelson House where improvements need to be made to the high school, in Gods Lake Narrows where we need a new high school, and in Gods River where we need a new school, period.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247166">In terms of transportation, we need to look at the needs of communities that have no roads and where all weather roads are melting at a very alarming rate as a result of the impacts of climate change. We need to look at building airports in communities that have no airports. The recent crash in northern Manitoba speaks to the need for improved transportation security. As someone who survived a plane crash, I see the need for the federal government to step up and make sure there is transportation security and sustainable ways of transportation for people in northern Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247167">We also need to see support from the federal government in terms of the bay line and the port of Churchill, important economic centres for our region. We also need to have a very good discussion in terms of the elimination of the Canadian Wheat Board, an institution that supports the economy in northern Canada and benefits Canadians all across the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247168">In terms of infrastructure, we need to look at more funding for affordable housing. The lack of affordable housing limits the diversification of many communities across my region. There are shameful housing conditions across first nations communities that need to be dealt with on an urgent basis. We also see the need for seniors housing.</ParaText>

We need to make sure that there is funding for child care in terms of capital as well as programming in order to support young families in my region.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247170">On the environment, for us northerners we have a close exposure to the impacts of climate change and the destruction of our environment. We see the ice lasting less and we see the change in wildlife patterns all across our region. Northerners are concerned about the preservation of our environment. We need to see action.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247171">I would also like to bring forward the issues facing youth. In the throne speech we heard tough words on gangs and cracking down on youth crime. How about looking at the opportunities of young people and supporting our young people? As I said, I come from one of the youngest regions of Canada. The median age is 26.4 years. We have communities without recreation centres, without programming, without drop-in centres. We need to look at the positive contributions of young people. The Lance Runners Society, the Island Lake Regional Youth Council, and Tori Yetman are excellent examples of the initiatives being taken in our region. We need to look at building and supporting healthy initiatives and programs for our young people.</ParaText>

There is a failure to deal with the needs and issues that Canadians face. I would like to see Parliament work together toward a vision for Canada that reflects the needs of Canadians all across this country. We need a vision that aims to realize social and economic justice for all.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247175">We also need Canadians to be involved. First, there is a need to have a more civil Parliament, something which is essential. Canadians are not interested in lowbrow aggressive attacks and are looking toward important work getting done on their behalf.

We saw it in this election where there was one of the lowest turnouts ever and incredible amounts of cynicism.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247176">Second, we need to make our electoral system and our political institutions inclusive and have them truly reflect who we are as a country. For example, the voter ID regulations disenfranchised many people across Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="1247177">Many of us ask why there are not more young people involved. Let us look at our institutions. Last week I was able to enter the Senate and listen to the throne speech as an MP. Despite the fact that I can be democratically elected to represent Canadians in the House of Commons, I would not, and neither would anybody under the age of the 30, be allowed to become a senator under the proposed reforms.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247178">At the age of 18 one can vote, one can run for office, one can fight and die for one's country, but one cannot become a senator.

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Charlton" id="2559531"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128220" Type="2">Ms. Chris Charlton (Hamilton Mountain, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1247201">Mr. Speaker, thank you for giving me the opportunity to participate in this debate on the government's Speech from the Throne. I know that the number of members who can speak on this matter is limited and severely curtailed by the rules of the House, so I really am delighted to respond. </ParaText><ParaText id="1247202">I am delighted for two reasons. The first one is, frankly, because I am still here and for that I want to thank the people of <Affiliation DbId="128220" Type="2">Hamilton Mountain</Affiliation> who have given me the opportunity to be their champion in the House of Commons for a second term. I am deeply grateful for that.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247203">Second, I am delighted to participate in this debate because it is central to setting this Parliament's agenda for dealing with the unprecedented downturn in the Canadian economy. Families in my riding, like Canadians right across the country, are profoundly worried about their jobs, about their pensions and about their savings. They are counting on the federal government to take bold and strategic steps, and they are looking to their members of Parliament to have courage in the face of adversity. Yet, the throne speech, which sets the agenda for this entire session of Parliament, fails to match the urgency or the depth required to protect working families in this economy. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247204">Let me clear, our number one job is to protect Canadians during this economic crisis. I have heard members speak about the need to stimulate the economy. I have heard others rightly point out that we do not just need to stimulate the economy, but we need to stabilize it. The difference of course is more than mere semantics.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247205">However, the bottom line is that the economy and the market are not some supernatural phenomenon. Neither were they created by divine law. They were man-made constructs and as such they are relationships that are governed by the rules that we created. These rules create a framework for determining winners and losers, and that makes it incumbent upon all of us to recognize that the economy is a moral question.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247206">As Tommy Douglas used to say, the economy is made for man, not man for the economy. Yet we have built economic structures that serve powerful global forces acting in their own interest, presenting profit as the chief spur to economic progress, free competition as the guiding norm of economics, and private ownership of the means of production as an absolute right. The sky was the limit and there seemed to be no concomitant social obligations. We were all led to believe that governments are the problem and that markets are the solution.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247207">If the current economic crisis has proven nothing else, it is that markets cannot do it alone. Yes, markets can bring prosperity, but governments not only have a role to play, they have a responsibility to act. For far too long now our economy has failed to serve the needs and the aspirations of Canadians. In fact, workers in our country have now paid four times for the economic crisis that we are in. </ParaText><ParaText id="1247208">First, they have lost their jobs. Since 2006, Canada has lost over 151,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector alone. Unemployment is projected to rise to 7% by next year and our industrial heartland is decaying around us. </ParaText><ParaText id="1247209">Second, workers have paid with their pensions. Workplace pensions and private pensions have all taken a huge hit as a result of the market collapse and those close to retirement are spending tomorrow's savings to make it through today.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247210">Third, workers no longer have adequate access to protection through employment insurance. Nationally only 38% of unemployed workers receive government benefits, down from 75% in the early nineties. Workers paid for this insurance coverage and yet they cannot count on it when they need it most. </ParaText><ParaText id="1247211">Of course, they are now paying for this economic crisis a fourth time as their tax dollars are going to bail out corporations like the banks. It is time to say enough is enough.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247212">It is time to right the balance and work to stabilize the economy in such a way that it will serve Canadians. It is time to be bold and it is time to be strategic. It is time to roll up our sleeves and work together to build an economy that serves the needs and aspirations of our people.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247213">As the very first step, we have to abandon the Conservative government's policies of throwing money away on unconditional corporate tax cuts. Unconditional tax cuts will not provide the stimulus that our economy requires. Quite the opposite. Tax cuts only benefit those corporations that are profitable enough to pay taxes. If a company is in danger of collapse, it does not pay taxes and blanket tax cuts do nothing to help it to survive.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247214">Moreover, we should not be providing tax breaks to companies that outsource or ship jobs overseas. In my hometown of Hamilton people will remember what happened at the John Deere plant just down the road in Welland. John Deere gladly pocketed the tax breaks and then closed its profitable plant and shipped the jobs down to Mexico.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1247215">Unconditional corporate tax cuts are not the answer to revitalizing the Canadian economy, yet these corporate tax cuts will cost the government $7.3 billion in 2009-10 alone. That money would be so much better spent on investing in the inherent productivity that resides in the talent, creativity and energy of Canadians. We need to invest in the real economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247216">Let us look again at the four ways, that I mentioned earlier, in which Canada's workers have paid for this economic crisis and let us look for solutions for each.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247217">First and foremost, we need to develop an economic stimulus package to create jobs. In the short term, that means strategic investments in infrastructure. Let us commit to an ambitious plan to partner with communities to repair our crumbling cities, invest in public transit and build affordable housing. I know that the city of Hamilton, for example, is ready to start construction now on a new sewer and water plant. The planning is done. The engineering is done. With the federal government's support, construction could begin immediately. It is good for workers, good for suppliers, and good for the city of Hamilton.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247218">I know that municipalities in other parts of the country have similar jobs that are virtually shovel ready. Projects related to energy retrofitting homes and buildings, expanding our renewable energy capacity, and improving our communications technology backbone also offer economic stimuli. Of course, we need to support the manufacturing and auto sectors, not by writing blank cheques to perpetuate the status quo, but by providing the kind of financial assistance that will transform the industries and keep jobs in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247219">Second, we need to protect the pensions of hard-working Canadians. This has to be done in consultation with labour, with business and the provinces, so that we can explore programs like a pension insurance program. In the last Parliament, I introduced Bill <Document DbId="3073165" Type="4">C-270</Document>, which would have given workers' pensions super priority in cases of commercial bankruptcies. Legislation such as this is still a critical part of the solution in safeguarding Canadians' pensions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247220">For those Canadians who are over the age of 71, let us at least consider a moratorium on mandatory RRIF withdrawals. I think all Canadian retirees were profoundly disappointed that pensions were not even mentioned in last week's Speech from the Throne.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247221"> Similarly, the throne speech was silent on reform to Canada's system of employment insurance. As a result of the rule changes that recent governments have made to the system, unemployed people must now all but exhaust their savings before EI is even available to them. Let us fix EI. It is a critical tool for poverty prevention and the money that unemployed Canadians receive will flow directly back into the local economy, thereby helping to create badly needed jobs and keeping small businesses afloat.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247222"> There was a time when EI was a vital part of retraining and skills development assistance. That is no longer the case. In fact, we have no national training strategy at all. Tackling the skills shortage must be part of the solution if we do not want to further compound the length and depth of this economic downturn.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247223">Finally, let us talk about the contribution Canadians have already made to ailing sectors of our economy such as financial institutions. To date, they have contributed $75 billion just to secure our banks. They need to be assured that there will be strong oversight that tracks where that money is going. Whenever sectoral assistance is provided, taxpayers need a full and transparent accounting, and where appropriate, an equity stake in return.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247224">These are just four areas for concrete action, and yes, they do represent bold steps, but hard-working Canadians deserve no less. They already know that New Democrats are committed to making the economy work for them, and despite the fact that the throne speech failed to stand up for working families and the middle class, it is not too late to protect their jobs, their pensions and their savings.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247225">In just a couple of days the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> will table his economic update. Perhaps that will give Canadians a few more specifics, but if it too remains tepid in its approach to protecting working families in these tough economic times, then we in the NDP will roll up our sleeves and work with our partners in labour, in civil society, and in our own communities to give Canadians the leadership they deserve.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247226">We commit to being constructive and we hope the government will do the same, because as Tommy used to say, it is not too late to build a better world.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It is a tremendous honour and privilege to serve them. It is in that interest that I want to remind everyone that the government made commitments in the last election and that we will keep those commitments.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247247">Some of those commitments were in the Speech from the Throne, to which I will speak. The points I will talking about this afternoon include support for transfers, support for Ontario infrastructure, small and medium-sized business and how we will cut red tape, support for industry and transitional help for workers. We need a common securities regulator and, in particular and of special interest to Northumberland—Quinte West, support for our farming community.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247248">One of the hallmarks of our federation has been the balance we have created between the so-called have and have-not provinces. As a member of Parliament for Ontario, I am acutely aware that Ontarians have for many years been a significant contributor to attaining that balance. I have heard from the Premier of Ontario, my local member of provincial Parliament as well as constituents who want and quite frankly need to know what our government is doing in regard to Ontario.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247249">It is about fiscal fairness after all, is it not? It should not be about paternalistic arrangements between the federal and provincial governments, but more a partnership. What our government has strove for, and I believe has achieved, is precisely just that balance. It will change from time to time, but it should always be about fairness. What is good for one partner in confederation should be good for all, and that is the standard we constantly strive to attain.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247250">Fiscal fairness is about ensuring Ontario has the funds and support it needs to meet its responsibility under the constitution, which includes vital programs such as health care, child care, post-secondary education and social programs. We know the federal government plays an important role in supporting Ontario and delivering for Ontarians. We also know that Ontario is and will continue to be a leader among the provinces and that it must be treated equitably by the federal government. Ontario should never have to suffer second-class services because of unfair treatment from Ottawa.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247251"> We have been in office for a little over two and a half years. We are the longest continuous minority government, and what have we done? </ParaText><ParaText id="1247252">Budget 2007 established a per capita based formula for the Canada health and social transfers. This is the money the federal government gives to support health and social services in the provinces. Per capita based funding is important to Ontario, as Ontario is Canada’s most populous province and thus changes will significantly approve the ability of Ontario to deliver for Ontarians.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247253">On this plan, no province that receives equalization funding will have a higher fiscal capacity than the province that does not receive the funding. These changes were agreed to by all first ministers, including the Premier of Ontario, and they will come into effect when the current agreement expires in 2014-15.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247254">The question then becomes: How can we help Ontario in the time left in the old agreement? To help transition to this new arrangement, we have implemented an automatic 6% annual escalator in health care transfer funding. The health transfer for 2007-08 to Ontario is $8.5 billion. By 2013-14, this transfer will rise to $11 billion. That is a 30% increase in health funding in just five years.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247255">We have also increased funding for social programs in Ontario through the social transfer, which has been strengthened to $3.7 billion. This amount will grow annually by 3% per year until a new agreement comes into effect. Part of the social transfer, some $411 million, is dedicated to child care spaces and post-secondary education.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1247256">However, there is more. The Conservative government also sees that it has an important role in supporting Ontario's municipalities and supporting infrastructure renewal. That is why we have recently signed an agreement with Ontario called “Building Canada”. This is a $6.26 billion agreement to be paid out over the next several years and is dedicated to improvements to infrastructure. The federal government knows that our communities need predictable funding for infrastructure.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247257">At this point, I would like to mention my first meeting with the Northumberland county council in 2006, shortly after that federal election.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247258">When I met with the county councillors, the meeting primarily concerned agriculture. All of the candidates involved in that election attended the meeting. We all renewed our commitment to agriculture. However, during that meeting, several of the councillors, and indeed the warden, indicated to their newly-elected member that they needed some long-term sustainable funding, something that when they were constructing their budgets, they could count on from the federal government. While they appreciated different programs, they needed some long-term sustainable funding.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247259">I heard what they said. Our government heard what they said. I am happy to say that as part of the building Canada agreement, we have made the gas tax refund to our communities permanent. For the county of Northumberland, that means approximately $2.5 million per year from now on, so when it is doing its budgets, it can count on that amount of money. For the municipality or the city of Quinte West, that is a little over $2.6 million. It is significant money because it is using that not only to pave streets and fix bridges, but to bring fresh potable water to communities, to renew infrastructure that had been deteriorating.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247260"> This means for our municipalities, both large and small, access to $2.9 billion a year for local roads and other projects.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247261">They also failed to mention some other long-term funding programs that we brought in, and one in particular is the 100% GST rebate to the municipalities. To some that might not seem a lot when we talk about staplers or stationery, but when a small or medium-sized municipality needs to buy a dump trunk or a road grader, that is a significant return.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247262">In addition, we have also agreed to support Ontario with over $3 billion for infrastructure programs, which includes funding for connectivity.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247263">I need not tell the House or I need not tell any Canadian how important connectivity is. In the Speech from the Throne our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> indicated that connectivity was very important for this government.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247264">I have to take my hat off to the member for <Affiliation DbId="128356" Type="2">Prince Edward—Hastings</Affiliation> in his leadership in eastern Ontario in this area. We have been working with the eastern Ontario wardens caucus. We believe that with its help we will be able to continue to work together. I believe we will be able to secure funding for connectivity for eastern Ontario, let alone all of Canada, as the Prime Minister has indicated.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247265">Therefore, we can see that the government has a proven record to address the issues of fiscal fairness. We have a long-term plan to address this, which the Premier of Ontario supports. It is principles-based and it supports important services, from health care, to social programs, to daycare spaces, to post-secondary education and to infrastructure needs.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247266">While we are talking about infrastructure, I was approached shortly after my election by numerous municipal mayors and councillors. They spoke to me in particular about the former Canada-Ontario infrastructure program and the fact that when this program was brought in, there were significant cost overruns because everybody was doing the same thing at the same time.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1247267">There were increases in construction costs. In addition, there were some regulatory changes to freshwater in Ontario. That drove up the cost of these projects and there were overruns. This was a one-third shared costing. The municipalities and the provinces agreed to share in the cost overruns, but the previous government did not. </ParaText><ParaText id="1247268">When the Conservatives took office, the mayors reiterated their desire that the federal government come forward with its one-third of the cost overruns. I am happy to say that this government was able to provide $50 million of that for the province of Ontario. In Northumberland—Quinte West announcements have been made, totalling some $3 million to help with those cost overruns.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247269">Also while we are talking about infrastructure, it is important that I remind the residents of Northumberland—Quinte West as well as the greater Quinte area of the tremendous investments that we have been making in the infrastructure at CFB Trenton. We will recall our commitment in 2005-06 to refurbish and rebuild the Canadian Armed Forces which for many years had been neglected. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247270">Part of that refurbishment was the purchase of strategic and tactical lift aircraft. What does that mean for CFB Trenton, which is Canada's air force hub? It meant the necessity of completely renovating and creating new places to store the new aircraft. If anyone drives by CFB Trenton 8 Wing, it is a hub of activity. Hundreds of millions of dollars over the next several years will be invested in CFB Trenton. That whole base will be transformed, thus creating hundreds of good paying jobs right across Northumberland—Quinte West and the greater Quinte region.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247271">In addition, the government promised and made an announcement that JTF2 would be relocated to CFB Trenton. This will require significant infrastructure changes also. Again, hundreds of new jobs will be coming into the community.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247272">What does that mean? The spinoffs are tremendous. It means we have to create housing for these hundreds of new families. They are going to purchase new cars and the spinoffs are numerous.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247273">We also promised in the Speech from the Throne to cut red tape for small and medium-sized businesses. Our government will cut the red tape faced by private and not-for-profit sectors when doing business with the government. Our government is committed to reforming and streamlining the way it does business and we will pursue innovative reforms to the administration of programs and services. Reducing the administrative and paper burden on Canadian businesses improves Canada's competitiveness and supports small business.</ParaText>

The member was in the House, as was I, earlier when we heard some statistics about employment insurance. We heard that only 38% of workers who pay into the employment insurance fund now qualify for benefits. This is down from 75% in the early 1990s. A decline, I might add, that began under the previous Liberal government which did nothing to repair that problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247302">We also saw the employment insurance surplus essentially being confiscated by the government, which amounts to taking premiums that were paid by the workers for their own employment insurance needs and taking those funds improperly away from them.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247303">Even if workers qualify for employment insurance, the amount of money they receive, slightly over $400 a week for a duration, is insufficient.

I will start by sincerely thanking the voters of the riding of Rimouski-Neigette—Témiscouata—Les Basques, who showed their trust in me by choosing me as their representative on October 14. I owe this privilege to them, and I am committed to getting started on the job they elected me to do: representing their interests in Parliament, and being there to listen to their concerns.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247319">I must also say that our campaign would not have been so successful without the hard work of my election committee. I warmly thank each and every one of the members of this team who were dedicated and enthusiastic.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247320">My thanks would not be complete if I did not mention my family. Their support, love and assistance were vital to me during this election campaign, and I thank them very much for being there for me.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247321">Today, in this, my first speech I would like to address some issues that were very much in the forefront during my campaign, yet unfortunately do not seem to have been given the importance they deserve in the Speech from the Throne. I therefore wish to speak for the most part about agriculture, forestry and the funding of not-for-profit organizations. These are vital issues for the people in my riding and for the regions of Quebec in general.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247322">First of all, the agri-food industry is responsible for nearly 20% of all the jobs in the lower St. Lawrence region, and agriculture makes up the bulk of that industry. This in large part explains why my concerns focus on development of the agricultural sector. It is also why I, as a member of Parliament, will be calling for the government to pay particular attention to this issue.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247323">What is more, as a dairy farmer myself, I am well placed to speak about the agricultural reality and the difficulties agricultural producers are facing at this time. There are really a great many challenges: we have to adapt to a demand for more diversified products, to international competition, to stricter environmental requirements. With respect to the latter, even though the farmers of the lower St. Lawrence region have long been environmentally aware and involved, there is always a need for more investment in order to keep abreast of current standards. So what the agricultural sector needs, and what is totally missing from the throne speech, is solid agricultural policies such as adequate federal financial support that will offer all the flexibility Quebec farmers have been demanding for years, and allow them to continue their chosen way of life and to continue to feed the community. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247324">I find that that the Conservative government has a great deal of difficulty understanding that Quebec agriculture is unlike agriculture in the rest of Canada. Quebec has opted for a more people-oriented agriculture, one that is less focused on exports. The Conservative government also does not seem to understand the crucial importance of maintaining supply management for Quebec agriculture. Rather than offering a genuine guarantee that it will defend supply management in international negotiations without making compromises, the government has simply stated that it will defend it. Thus, we are very skeptical about how willing this government really is to protect farmers, especially since some statements by Conservative ministers suggest that they are hoping to reach an agreement at the WTO even if it is to the detriment of supply management.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247325">Thus, agriculture will remain one of the core priorities for me as well as for the Bloc Québécois. We will be vigilant and will not allow the Conservative government's indifference to override the needs of the citizens of Quebec regions.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247326">There is the same disappointment in the forestry sector. There is no substantive assistance program to deal with the crisis. In the throne speech, the government says it wants to continue helping the forestry sector with measures that promote innovation and the sale of goods abroad. In other words, the government is opting for the status quo. It is proposing very modest measures, which had already been announced in the last budget and did not really help the forestry sector get through the crisis. </ParaText><ParaText id="1247327">In my riding, where private producers are in the majority, expectations were much higher. After two troubled years, the forestry producers find themselves in a difficult situation where production costs continue to rise and profits are non-existent.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1247328">The very survival of many woodlot-based family businesses is in jeopardy. Business owners and producers in the forestry sector need to be supported in their efforts. Assistance for research and innovation is also needed for the forestry industry, particularly, for secondary and tertiary processing.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247329">It is also important to promote the creation of small businesses through research and development. The government could have used some of the Bloc Québécois' proposals, such as granting loan guarantees to help companies modernize, making the research and development tax credit a refundable credit for existing and new businesses, and enforcing regulations requiring all federal agencies to use forest products in federal building projects. These measures could be very beneficial for the forestry sector, but the Conservative government does not seem to be interested in them.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247330">As a final point, I would like to discuss a third issue my constituents are very concerned about, namely, the funding of not-for-profit organizations of an economic nature. Naturally, I cannot help but mention the cuts announced this year by the former Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec, cuts that are already having a serious impact on organizations and research centres in my riding. This shows the Conservative government's completely irresponsible attitude, considering the importance of federal funding in the operational activities of many such organizations. The government should reverse its decision and ensure that the approved funding is maintained and renewed.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247331">Many organizations and centres in the lower St. Lawrence region benefit from this financial support, including the Centre de recherche sur les biotechnologies marines and the Technopole maritime du Québec, which in turn greatly benefit the region and have made Rimouski a leader in the marine sector. The current <Affiliation DbId="128720" Type="4">Minister of State (Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec)</Affiliation> should reinstate the financial support and, at the very least, give these organizations an alternative to ensure their long-term survival. It is unthinkable that such organizations could disappear for lack of funding when we know that the federal government has the money. The real problem is the government's policy direction. It is the government's lack of vision and its indifference toward regional development in Quebec.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247332">We must not forget that not-for-profit organizations generate economic spinoffs for the region. They respond to community expectations and use people's expertise. These strengths and abilities would otherwise be lost. The government could get smart and take advantage of all the money the organizations have invested in recent years by involving them in a real economic recovery plan. In the coming months, we will see what the Conservative government does about this issue, but we are already very concerned about the insensitivity the government has shown to date. The government was not willing to negotiate, even after many people in Quebec spoke out and condemned the incomprehensible cuts the Conservative government had made.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247333">For all these and other reasons, the Bloc Québécois cannot support the throne speech.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Blais" id="2559574"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128571" Type="2">Mr. Raynald Blais (Gaspésie—Îles-de-la-Madeleine, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1247355">Mr. Speaker, naturally I would first like to congratulate you on your appointment as well as congratulate all of the members who were elected or re-elected. I would also like to thank the people of the riding I represent, Gaspésie—Îles-de-la-Madeleine, and express my tremendous pride in this region. I am here for my third consecutive mandate, since 2004, to defend the interests of the people from the riding of Gaspésie—Îles-de-la-Madeleine, who care about their region and who also care about having a better future. First of all, I would like to say that my region has dreams of sovereignty. That day will come. As our late father of sovereignty, and citizen of the Gaspé, René Lévesque, said: Next time.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247356">Countries are built one day at a time. That is what we see here. A country can also be destroyed one day at a time. Unfortunately, that is what we are seeing here today. The Speech from the Throne is a blatant display of insensitivity towards people in the regions in particular. I would like to speak about the regions. I will let those who live in cities say what they have to say. The Gaspé and the Magdalen Islands and other similar regions were expecting some form of understanding or concern for our situation, especially in terms of our current economic and financial troubles. Unfortunately, we are well aware that a Speech from the Throne is a speech of intentions. It can be as vague as vague can be. But we would be hard-pressed to find one more vague and insensitive than this.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247357">This speech does not acknowledge in any way that people living in regions such as ours are deeply affected by decisions made here and elsewhere. I will talk about the fisheries. We know very well that this resource is exported. We know the importance of the fisheries in the area I represent. It is dependent on exports of lobster, shrimp, crab or other species. It is also dependent on certain infrastructures and on other elements that make up the famous fishing industry. These could be very well positioned to deal with the current crisis or the perceived crisis. They might even keep our region going very nicely.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247358"> I will simply reiterate certain points that I had the opportunity to present during the last election campaign. I will speak about five points. I had the chance to present a plan to better position our region. One of these plans had to do with the economy which, of necessity, requires a discussion of the state of the region, in particular its infrastructures, whether rail, marine, air or communications. The Speech from the Throne does not acknowledge such matters. It does not acknowledge the basic infrastructure needs. Whether we like it or not, regions such as ours need these infrastructures. Not only must they be appropriate but they must also be available. It is fine to have a train. However, in my area, passenger train service is only available three times per week. Thus, it is not really available. It goes by on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays. What happens on the other days?</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="25">(1725)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1247359">The people in Matapédia have to make do with a train that runs six days a week, every day but Monday. One can imagine the logistical nightmare this creates for people who need to take the train, and God knows they do need to take the train at times.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247360">The situation with regard to federal infrastructure is scandalous and shameful. I am talking about wharves and small craft harbours. I have been here for eight years, nearly five of them as a member of Parliament. Previously, I was an assistant. The Bloc has consistently championed the cause of small craft harbours. At one time, prior to 2000, the budget for small craft harbour maintenance and repairs was $50 million. Today, it is $100 million a year. That could give the impression that things have improved, but they have deteriorated. In fact, the department itself admits that more than $500 million is needed. The figures speak for themselves. If there is $100 million a year for all the wharves but $500 million is needed to restore them, it is like a leaky roof that is never repaired. Eventually, the roof will collapse. That is exactly what is happening with our harbours. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247361">Economically, the regions are forgotten, neglected and ultimately cast aside in other ways as well. Federal programs such as those created by the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec have no flexibility. For regions such as ours, if a program is introduced and not adapted to the regional reality it might as well not exist, however attractive it may be in other respects. That is exactly what is happening with the Conservative government at present. Unfortunately, I do not see any indication in the throne speech that the government intends to change things. But our finance and other critics can be counted on to again raise the issue of modifying programs. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247362">The people of my riding are also concerned about the environment. Ours is a maritime region. Changes in climate or sea level are a matter of life and death for some places, such as the Magdalen Islands for instance. That is why there is such sensitivity about this issue. Unfortunately there is not much in the throne speech, with the possible exception of the intention to protect the economy and to render the environment more economic than sustainable. They are totally missing the boat with that. That kind of thinking is really wide of the mark and once again the Bloc Québécois can be counted on to raise the issue again.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247363">There is another reality, a very localized one, the ZIPs, priority intervention zones. These are found in maritime areas, Gaspé, the Magdalen Islands and in other places in Quebec as well. Things are now at an impasse because any little bit of cooperation there was between Fisheries and Oceans and Environment Canada is a thing of the past.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247364">Other issues were addressed during the election campaign, particularly those relating to social programs, such as employment insurance and the guaranteed income supplement. Here again, people can count on the Bloc Québécois to continue the battle. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247365">The final two subjects I wish to raise relate to government services. Generally, when times are tough and a government talks about examining departmental programs and budgets, the first targets, the first victims, are the so-called outlying regions. The Bloc Québécois will again be present to defend the interests of our people. </ParaText><ParaText id="1247366">Finally, I would like to address the issue of the specific living conditions of those living in those outlying regions. It is a known fact that there is a really strong regional identity that differentiates one region from another. What is important to us is to achieve true cooperation. We will see how things progress as we go along, but unfortunately there is no sign of anything hopeful in the Speech from the Throne. </ParaText>

We were elected to act scrupulously and responsibly. Acting scrupulously and responsibly means defending the interests of Quebeckers and our constituents with full knowledge of the facts. And, with full knowledge of the facts, when faced with a throne speech or budget situation, all members must consider whether it will improve the lives of our constituents, that is, the people we represent, and act accordingly.

It is a well-deserved honour. I know that you will work well with all members of this chamber. Again, I congratulate you. A couple of years ago when you were first appointed as Assistant Deputy Chair of Committees of the Whole, I thought your mom would be very proud of you, and I bet she is even prouder of you now.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247381">Since this is the first opportunity I have had to stand and speak in the chamber since the election, I would like to start off, as many members have done, by thanking a few people who helped me get here today.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247382">First, I would like to thank all the constituents of Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre for re-electing me to this place. I was first elected, as you know, Mr. Speaker, because we arrived here at the same time, in 2004. We were re-elected in 2006 and once again most recently on October 14 this year. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247383">All members agree with me when I say that to be elected as a member of Parliament is not only an honour, but it is also a very humbling experience. I know there is a great deal of trust that constituents put in members when they send them to Ottawa, and we can only hope we do the job and repay that trust to the best of our ability. I can honestly state that I have always tried to do so and I will continue to do so in this latest opportunity.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247384">I also want to thank all of my campaign team and the volunteers who worked so very hard to get me elected. We had hundreds of volunteers. As all members of Parliament know, we cannot get elected without the help of a great many people. Those people on my campaign team and all the volunteers deserve a great deal of credit.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247385">Most important, I want to thank my wife, Diane. In a previous life before I was a member of Parliament, I worked in the political arena, but I actually worked on behalf of a political party. One of my jobs was to interview prospective candidates. </ParaText><ParaText id="1247386"><B>An hon. member: </B> Which party?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247387"><B>Mr. Tom Lukiwski: </B> Mr. Speaker, a member opposite asked a very good question. It was the Saskatchewan Party. I am very pleased to say that. </ParaText><ParaText id="1247388">One of my jobs was to interview prospective candidates. After I went through a long list of qualifications and questions to the candidate, I always asked this final question: “Do you have the 100% support of your family, whether it be your wife, your significant other or your children?” I told them that if they did not have that 100% support, then do not get into this game. It can be a tough game at times. I call it a game which is probably a little disrespectful for the job that we do. However, my point is that unless we have that undying and unyielding support from our families, it is a tough business to be in.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247389"> I want to thank my wife, Diane, who always believed that I would be elected. Even when I did not believe it in 2004, she was the one who said I would get elected, even though the odds were against me. Since that time I have been very fortunate to be elected twice more with increasing majorities and an increasing percentage of vote each and every time.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247390">I want to say one other thing before I get into the body of my remarks. I have noticed since being back here in Parliament, a renewed sense of cooperation among all members in this chamber. I am so very happy to see that. We know this is a very partisan business and I do not know how long the spirit of cooperation and goodwill will last, perhaps not as long as we would all like, but it seems now we have a real willingness on behalf of all members in the chamber to work together. </ParaText><ParaText id="1247391">We have some very challenging times ahead of us. Our throne speech identified those challenges. Without question, the single biggest challenge that we parliamentarians and all Canadians face is the economy. Let me be more specific. It is not just the economy, but the unprecedented global economic crisis in which Canadians and citizens throughout the world find themselves.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247392">I would argue to members in this place that we have never seen the type of economic crisis in our lifetime that we are currently facing. Many financial observers are equating this to the Great Depression of the 1930s. Some observers are suggesting that in history, no one has ever seen the type of economic problems and economic crisis we are currently facing. All I can say is I know I have never seen anything like this in my lifetime. I think my father could also say he probably never saw anything as severe as this in his lifetime. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="40">(1740)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1247393">Once again what we need to do is try to identify the root causes of this crisis that we are facing globally. We want to ensure that whatever actions we take as a Parliament--and I say as a Parliament as opposed to as a government, because we all have to work together to find solutions--but whatever solutions we do come up with to rectify the problems we currently face, and we know what caused these problems to begin with, we should try to avoid any solutions that might even border on the same type of situations that placed us in this crisis to begin with.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247394">It has been fairly well documented that only a few short months ago this global economic upside-down crisis started unfolding rapidly. We all know it was unfolding because of what is called the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States where, because of a lot of lax regulatory provisions put in by the government of the United States, there was an absolute meltdown of the mortgage business.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247395">The result is it manifested itself into a credit crunch. It first started in the United States but then rapidly spread worldwide. Why the credit crunch had such a devastating effect on our economy and economies across the world and stock markets both here and abroad was the fact that financial institutions found themselves in a situation where they did not want to lend money to individuals or businesses. There were liquidity problems. There were bailouts. Mortgage companies and financial institutions were going under. This is the root cause of the problems we are facing at this moment.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247396"> The other thing I should point out is that it was an unprecedented, at least in my observation, rapid deterioration of the world's economies. This was not something that slowly progressed over a number of months. This was something that progressed over a number of weeks. Now on a daily basis we see the economy getting worse and worse.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247397">The only thing I can suggest is a silver lining in all of this is the fact that here in Canada, even though we are facing very difficult times, we are the best positioned country in the industrialized world. That does not mean we are going to escape this economic crisis unscathed. We are not. There will be some very difficult times in the months ahead and Canadians know it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247398">Consumer confidence is down to probably an all-time low. Canadians are more than just concerned; I would suggest they are frightened. Canadians are frightened because they feel that they may lose their jobs. They may lose their pensions. They may lose their homes. There are people living off their investment income who have seen the value of their investments reduced by close to 50% within the last six months.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247399">All of us in this place understand that. We fundamentally understand the fear that all Canadians are feeling. We understand their concerns. Canadians are turning to us to come up with some solutions. I would suggest that it is incumbent upon all of us to work together to try to find those solutions.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247400">The Speech from the Throne that was read just a few short days ago dealt primarily with our economy for the reasons I have just mentioned, not to the exclusion of some of the other initiatives that our government wishes to move forward with over the course of the next term of office, but the priority is on the economy and for very good reason. It is our economy and some of the possible solutions to the problems we are facing that I want to deal with in the next few minutes. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1247401">We have heard many people say over the course of the last few weeks that an economic stimulus package must be forthcoming and forthcoming shortly. A lot of people have asked me what that exactly means. If a stimulus package is forthcoming at all, what form will it take? What does it mean? Some people suggest, and when I say some people I mean governments across the world, that what it means to them are bailouts to specific and targeted industries and companies. </ParaText><ParaText id="1247402">We know all too well some of the situations that are happening to the automotive sector both here and south of the border. It is obviously far more severe south of the border because the auto sector in the United States has seen its sales drop precipitously over the course of the last few months. There has been a 15% to 20% reduction in sales. We have seen the big three automakers, General Motors, Chrysler and Ford, collectively go to Washington to talk to legislators and Congress. They have said that they need financial help and they need it now or else they may not make it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247403">There is an old saying that we have heard time and time again. It was first coined probably close to 80 to 100 years ago, and that is what is good for General Motors is good for the country and what is good for the country is good for General Motors. That is being turned on its head as we speak. There is a real and I think distinct possibility that unless something is done quickly, we may see the unthinkable, General Motors claiming bankruptcy. I think that is absolutely a distinct possibility.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247404">What will it mean if some of our largest automakers in North America go under? I know what the auto sector means in Canada. I believe either directly or indirectly one in seven jobs is tied to the auto sector in Canada. Yet we are still having a debate, and I have certainly heard it from constituents in Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, as to what to do about it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247405">Make no mistake, many in our country, well-intentioned individuals, intelligent individuals, prudent fiscal conservatives, are telling not only myself but I am sure other parliamentarians that there should be no bailouts to the auto sector. It got itself into this problem because of the fact it did not anticipate the needs of its consumers or it did not anticipate the transformation that was required to keep its industry healthy and therefore the industry should not now come cap in hand to the Canadian taxpayer and ask for a handout.</ParaText><ParaText id="1247406">I know many people have suggested that Parliament should not engage in any financial aid to the auto sector. I suggest at least 50% of parliamentarians have already heard that. They have either received emails or letters or have talked to constituents who have suggested the same thing. However, we need to have a rational debate in this place about that very situation. Would it be appropriate? Is it in the best interest of the Canadian taxpayer to assist the auto sector in our country? Is it in the best interest of the Canadian taxpayers?</ParaText><ParaText id="1247407">Many in different regions of the country are saying that if we help the auto sector, where does the lineup for financial aid end? Do we then turn to the forestry sector or other manufacturers and say, “You are in trouble, we understand that, we will help you?” </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1247408">How does one answer workers in the forestry industry, who make approximately half the hourly wage of auto workers, when they stand and say that they are opposed to any bailouts to the auto sector because it is not helping them. The auto workers make twice as much as they do on an hourly rate, yet they do not see any financial aid coming to them. How do we deal with that? We need to have intelligent, rational, reasonable debate and discussions about the appropriate course of action.</ParaText>
