This legislation contains needed measures to update Canada's fight against money laundering and terrorist financing activities.</ParaText><ParaText id="209941"> This new government is determined to be on the front lines of the important global fight against money laundering and organized crime, and against terrorist financing activities.</ParaText><ParaText id="209942">Canada's anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regime must be kept up to date and must adapt to evolving money laundering and terrorist financing schemes. Criminals are constantly changing their tactics and finding new ways to evade the law. </ParaText><ParaText id="209943">The proposed amendments in the bill before the House today are critical in helping to stay one step ahead of these criminals.</ParaText><ParaText id="209944">Bill <Document DbId="2374081" Type="3">C-25</Document> illustrates that Canada's new government is serious about ensuring that Canada's anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regimes both meet revised international standards in this area and also address the areas of risk here at home.</ParaText><ParaText id="209945">Before I address the specifics of this bill, I would like to take a few moments to provide some background to this proposed legislation to emphasize the importance of Bill <Document DbId="2374081" Type="3">C-25</Document>.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="209946">First, we ought to remind ourselves what exactly are money laundering and terrorist financing. </ParaText><ParaText id="209947">Members of the House are well aware that the activities of organized crime, such as drug trafficking and prostitution, generate significant amounts of money, usually in cash. The criminal or group must find a way to spend and invest the funds without attracting attention to the underlying illicit activity, lest it be shut down and they lose their source of revenue.</ParaText><ParaText id="209948">Money laundering of course is very difficult to quantify. However, the International Monetary Fund makes an educated estimate that the aggregate size of money laundering worldwide is between 2% and 5% of global GDP. That is a very significant amount.</ParaText><ParaText id="209949">How does money laundering work? How does it take place? Money laundering occurs in three stages. The first is the placement stage. In this stage the launderer introduces the illegal profits into the financial system. This is done in a number of ways. One is breaking up large amounts of cash into less conspicuous smaller sums that are then deposited directly into a bank account. Another is using cash to purchase a series of monetary instruments, cheques, money orders, et cetera, from financial institutions that are then collected and deposited into accounts at other locations.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="209950">The second stage is called layering. In this stage the launderer engages in a series of conversions or movements of the funds to distance them from the first place they were deposited. For example, this could be through the purchase or sale of investment instruments such as shares or a series of wire transfers to various bank accounts globally. </ParaText><ParaText id="209951">Having successfully moved the criminal profits through the first two stages of the money laundering process, the launderer then enters the third stage which is integration. It is at the integration stage that the funds re-enter the legitimate economy. The funds can now be invested or used to purchase luxury assets, real estate, securities or other investments.</ParaText><ParaText id="209952">Money launderers tend to seek out jurisdictions with weak or ineffective anti-money laundering programs. Canada does not want to be on that list. However, because the objective of money laundering is to get the illegal funds back to the individual who first collected them through criminal activity, launderers usually prefer to move funds through areas of highly developed, stable and sophisticated financial systems, and where the large volume of transactions may diminish the risk of suspicious transactions being detected. That is a country like Canada with a sophisticated and stable financial system.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp><ParaText id="209953">The other element, terrorist financing, how does that fit into this picture? Terrorist organizations require financial support in order to carry out their evil and destructive activities. A successful terrorist group, like a criminal organization, must be able to build and maintain a steady flow of funds. It must develop sources of money, a means to covertly move that money around, and a way to ensure that the money can be used to obtain the materials needed to commit terrorist acts.</ParaText><ParaText id="209954">Terrorist financing comes from two primary sources. First, there is state sponsored terrorism, sadly. Financial support is provided for these terrorist activities by states or organizations large enough to collect and then make funds available to the terrorist organization. A variation of this is where a wealthy individual provides funding. For example, Osama bin Laden is thought to have contributed significant amounts of his personal fortune to the establishment and support of the al-Qaeda network.</ParaText><ParaText id="209955">The second source of terrorist financing is money derived directly from various revenue generating activities. As with organized criminals, a terrorist group's income often comes from crime or other unlawful activities. For example, a terrorist group may engage in large scale smuggling, various types of fraud, robbery and narcotics trafficking. </ParaText><ParaText id="209956">However, unlike organized crime, terrorism can be financed using legitimate funds such as those collected in the name of charitable causes. These loopholes, often exploited by terrorist groups, need special attention in order for Canada to move effectively to deny terrorists the funds they use for their destructive deeds.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="209957">It is this second source of terrorist funds that the measures in the bill are designed to detect. </ParaText><ParaText id="209958">It is important to remember that this activity has an effect on all Canadians because money laundering, major criminal fraud, and financial crimes have the potential to undermine the Canadian economy by impacting the reputation and integrity of individual financial institutions, not to mention the financial sector as a whole.</ParaText><ParaText id="209959">Members of the House will appreciate that the integrity of Canada's banking and financial services depends on citizens and investors being able to trust that institutions are well regulated and protected from criminal elements. </ParaText><ParaText id="209960">By extension, a healthy financial system is absolutely critical to Canada's ability to attract investment, and therefore increase and sustain overall economic growth and productivity.</ParaText><ParaText id="209961">If funds from criminal activity can be easily processed through a particular institution because proper anti-money laundering controls are not in place, institutions could be drawn into unwitting complicity with criminals. As well, evidence of such abuse will have a damaging effect on the perception of other financial intermediaries, regulatory authorities and Canadians themselves. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="209962">The potential costs of money laundering are of course serious. If not addressed, organized crime can infiltrate financial institutions, acquire control of large sectors of the economy through investment, create competitive disadvantages for local businesses, and continue to fund harmful criminal activity such as drug trafficking, human smuggling and prostitution which preys on women.</ParaText><ParaText id="209963">What has Canada done to prevent and deter money laundering and terrorist financing? </ParaText><ParaText id="209964">Since 2001 Canada has had an anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regime that is in the top tier of our international partners. This legislation has helped ensure that Canada is not a haven for money laundering and terrorist financing activities. </ParaText><ParaText id="209965">Indeed, Canada has made significant progress in detecting suspected cases of money laundering and terrorist financing. We continue to work closely with our domestic and international partners to improve the regime.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp><ParaText id="209966">In 2005-06, reporting entities filed upwards of 30,000 suspicious transaction reports with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada, FINTRAC. In turn, FINTRAC made 168 case disclosures to law enforcement agencies. In addition, 10 new domestic information-sharing agreements were signed with financial sector regulators. </ParaText><ParaText id="209967">FINTRAC now has 30 information-sharing agreements with foreign counterparts internationally. </ParaText><ParaText id="209968">Canada's new government has committed to a strong and comprehensive anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism regime that is consistent with international standards. That is what this bill, Bill <Document DbId="2374081" Type="3">C-25</Document>, is all about. It amends the existing legislation in order to update and enhance the legislation to better combat money laundering and terrorist financing activities.</ParaText><ParaText id="209969">To begin with, the measures proposed in the bill will update Canada's anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regime to be consistent with international standards set out by the Financial Action Task Force, which is the international standard-setting body on this issue. These standards were revised in 2003 and all task force members have had to update their regimes. Canada is now doing so with this bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="209970">The proposed amendments will require financial intermediaries to undertake a number of actions such as enhanced client identification and record-keeping measures. They will also be required to undertake enhanced measures with respect to certain clients and activities, for example with respect to foreign politically exposed persons and their banking relationships. </ParaText><ParaText id="209971">The reporting of suspicious attempted transactions will also be required.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="209972">Bill <Document DbId="2374081" Type="3">C-25</Document> also establishes a new registration regime for money services businesses that remit funds in and out of Canada and for foreign exchange dealers, within FINTRAC. This new regime will provide FINTRAC with a tool to increase compliance with the requirements under this act for money services businesses and foreign exchange dealers. Coupled with the registration requirement, a new offence will be created for operating an unregistered money services business.</ParaText><ParaText id="209973">The exclusion of legal counsel from the regime has been identified as a gap by both the Auditor General and law enforcement. Over the last number of years, the government has been negotiating with the legal profession on how best to include it in the regime. Through regulations made under Bill <Document DbId="2374081" Type="3">C-25</Document> and consistent with the Financial Action Task Force requirements, legal counsel will now be required to undertake client identification and record-keeping measures when acting as financial intermediaries. </ParaText><ParaText id="209974">These measures complement the prohibition on the receipt of cash over $7,500 by legal counsel that is currently in place and enforced through provincial law society rules of professional conduct. These measures also respect the Supreme Court of Canada's Lavallee decision.</ParaText><ParaText id="209975">Bill <Document DbId="2374081" Type="3">C-25</Document> also establishes monetary penalties in addition to existing criminal sanctions. This will allow FINTRAC to impose graduated penalties that adequately reflect the nature of the violation. The monetary penalties, for example, will be particularly useful for offences that are less advertent or egregious.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="209976">An important part of Bill <Document DbId="2374081" Type="3">C-25</Document> relates to information sharing. Specifically, the bill proposes to allow the exchange of information between FINTRAC here in Canada and the Canada Revenue Agency, and with Canadian law enforcement agencies, to better prevent and detect the use of registered charities for financing of terrorism.</ParaText><ParaText id="209977">Moreover, to increase the usefulness of FINTRAC's disclosures, the range of information disclosed will be expanded, as well as the list of disclosure recipients. This list will now include the Communications Security Establishment and the Canada Border Services Agency. Also, the agency will be allowed to share cross-border currency reporting information internally for the administration of immigration legislation. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp><ParaText id="209978">Amendments are also proposed in Bill <Document DbId="2374081" Type="3">C-25</Document> to allow information sharing of compliance-related information between FINTRAC and its foreign counterparts. As well, information sharing provisions are proposed between the Canada Border Services Agency and its foreign counterparts on the enforcement of the cross-border currency enforcing regime.</ParaText><ParaText id="209979">It is important to emphasize that Canada's government recognizes how essential it is to protect the privacy rights of Canadians. That is why Bill <Document DbId="2374081" Type="3">C-25</Document> includes a number of safeguards to protect those rights. The bill strikes the right balance in meeting the needs of law enforcement while respecting the privacy rights of Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="209980">I want to outline for the House these safeguards. First, there is an arm's length relationship between FINTRAC and law enforcement and other agencies entitled to receive information. Second, there is disclosure of only key information regarding financial institutions and publicly available information to police and other designated entities. Third, there are criminal penalties for any unauthorized use of disclosure of personal information under FINTRAC's control. Fourth, there is a requirement for a court order by law enforcement agencies to obtain any other than very minimal information from FINTRAC.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="209981">With the proposals contained in the bill, the anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regime will continue to strike an appropriate balance, on the one hand providing law enforcement and intelligence agencies with the tools they need to effectively fight money laundering and terrorist financing, while on the other hand taking appropriate and strong steps to respect and protect the privacy of Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="209982">The bill is consistent with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms as well as the Privacy Act.</ParaText><ParaText id="209983">In closing, I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the excellent work done by the Senate Standing Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce. Its insightful report calls for tougher measures to deal with money laundering and terrorist financing. This bill responds to the Senate committee recommendations.</ParaText><ParaText id="209984">Canada needs a robust and up to date anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regime to ensure security for Canadians on a number of fronts.</ParaText><ParaText id="209985"> Canada must also continue to meet its global obligations. For the year starting July 1, 2006, Canada will chair the international Financial Action Task Force, the international standard-setting body on this important issue. Taking on this responsibility, along with the measures proposed in Bill <Document DbId="2374081" Type="3">C-25</Document>, demonstrates the solid leadership of Canada's new government that we are showing in the global effort against money laundering and terrorist financing.</ParaText><ParaText id="209986">I therefore urge all hon. members to accord swift passage to this bill.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. McKay" id="1710511"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78463" Type="2">Hon. John McKay (Scarborough—Guildwood, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="209987">Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member on her speech. This bill flows from quite a number of the previous government's initiatives. I want to congratulate her and her government on trying to put together some form of bill to address this egregious problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="209988">This bill has a number of commendable features, but I want to ask my colleague a couple of questions with respect to some of the holes in the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="209989"> Recently I returned from Moscow, where I met with some Russian officials and talked about this very matter. The Russian officials told us that they are most concerned about the conversion of money into things like diamonds, platinum and things of that nature, other businesses, so to speak. That is how terrorism was being financed in Russia. Of course, regardless of what we think of the Chechen situation in Russia, the Russians regard it as a terrorist situation. Bill <Document DbId="2374081" Type="3">C-25</Document> will not deal with this problem. It leaves a very obvious gap, one through which even a not so well-informed criminal organization could take advantage.</ParaText><ParaText id="209990">I wonder what comfort the <Affiliation DbId="78945" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance</Affiliation> can give those who are watching that this form of conversion from a financial instrument to other valuable commodities might be addressed. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="209991">The second issue I have is with respect to the compromise with the legal profession. As I read this bill, it seems that lawyers will essentially be obligated to disclose financial records only if they know the identity of the client. This seems to me to be something of a low threshold of obligation on the part of the legal profession, which transacts massive sums of money on a daily basis. </ParaText><ParaText id="209992">I would be interested in the member's comments on both of these issues.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Ms. Ablonczy" id="1710524"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78945" Type="18">Ms. Diane Ablonczy</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="209993">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my hon. colleague's remarks. I think we can be proud that, no matter what stripe of government we have had in this country, this issue has been taken very seriously and strong measures have been put into place as a priority. I know that the hon. member has much to offer from his recent travels and I look forward to talking to him more about them.</ParaText><ParaText id="209994">The hon. member will be happy to know that this bill in fact does expand the number of reporting entities, including operators who deal in gemstones and precious metals, so some of the issues he raises will in fact now be included in this regime. We are also having discussions with the Home Builders' Association, because increasingly, investment in real estate now is being used by criminal organizations and terrorist organizations and we want to draw them in.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="209995">With respect to the lawyers, this bill represents a step forward in including this important body, which often deals with numbers of issues and entities. They will now be able to have the information that might be required at their fingertips should they be asked for it, under the strict guidelines set out by the Supreme Court in the Lavallee decision. The issue the hon. member raises is being dealt with in the bill in what I think is a balanced way, one that has, generally speaking, garnered the support of the broad base of the legal profession.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Also, the member raises a very important issue. Privacy of Canadians and ensuring that it is protected is a high priority for the government and for all members of the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="210000">The bill provides that financial institutions report directly to FINTRAC. They are not to be giving information to any other entity.

We are anxious to ensure that privacy rights are protected.</ParaText><ParaText id="210002">We have met with the Privacy Commissioner of Canada on this issue and will hold further meetings to ensure that we understand any concerns on privacy and meet them as strongly as possible.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="210010">I think everyone in the House would agree that while money is not everything, money is a lot, and one of the best ways to choke off terrorism and money launderers is to remove them from their source of money. Essentially, that is the purpose of FINTRAC. The purpose of the bill is to strengthen our ability to act in this area and to bring FINTRAC up to the international norms in terms of money laundering and terrorist financing. However, it is also important that we look at the other side of the coin, and that is privacy concerns and individual rights. </ParaText><ParaText id="210011">While the pursuit of choking off the sources of funds for money launderers and terrorists is extremely important, at the same time the bill has to safeguard the privacy rights of individuals and prevent a situation in which totally innocent people suffer as a consequence of this bill. I will come back to that point in a few minutes.</ParaText><ParaText id="210012">Overall, Liberals think the bill is a move in the right direction. We have a number of concerns that we will raise in committee and possibly propose amendments, but we will certainly support the bill for second reading.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210013">The bill proposes to make some necessary changes to the previous government's bill in 2001, Bill <Document DbId="73328" Type="3">C-36</Document>, the Anti-terrorism Act. I think changes like this will likely be required every few years as money launderers become more sophisticated and police need new powers to combat them. This is essentially the nature of money laundering and why it is so difficult to combat.</ParaText><ParaText id="210014">Technological changes occur and money launderers make a few steps ahead. It is always important for the government to react to that so we can be ahead of them, rather than they ahead of us. In that general sense, we fully support the intentions and actions of the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="210015">There are three concerns I would like to highlight today. Two of them have been raised by my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78463" Type="2">Scarborough—Guildwood</Affiliation>. </ParaText><ParaText id="210016">The first of these is that money laundering does not necessarily involve just money. It might involve precious jewels, diamonds and even real estate, as the parliamentary secretary indicated. Therefore, if we are to be comprehensive and effective in our pursuit of terrorist financing and money laundering, then we have to broaden the scope of the act beyond pure cash.</ParaText><ParaText id="210017">Much of what I am saying, I should point out, has come from a very good report entitled “Stemming the Flow of Illicit Money”, which was presented by fine colleagues from the other place. As they reported, the RCMP believes:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210018"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">--[a]s stricter regulations are imposed on businesses in the financial services industry, criminals are seeking alternative methods of laundering the money accumulated from criminal activity. Various characteristics of the (precious metals, stones and jewellery) industry make it highly vulnerable to criminal activity.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="210019">The RCMP has identified these businesses as likely places for criminals to launder their money. Therefore, there is a good case that the bill require members of this industry to report suspicious transactions in the same way that banks and other financial institutions are required to do. This point was reinforced by my colleague in his conversations with people in Russia.</ParaText><ParaText id="210020">I know the parliamentary secretary has suggested that in some respects the bill may respond to these concerns, but from my initial knowledge of the bill, it is not at all obvious to me that the bill provides an adequate response to these concerns. This will certainly be one of the areas that the Liberal Party will want to explore when the bill goes to committee.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp><ParaText id="210021">This as well was mentioned by my colleague from Scarborough. It is the issue of solicitor-client privilege and the need to balance that principle with the need for the government and for Canadian society to get tough and serious with terrorist financing and money laundering.</ParaText><ParaText id="210022">I am not sure that the compromise that has been reached with the legal profession is the perfect compromise. There may be other means to tighten that up, so the government, the security agencies and FINTRAC can get better information from the legal profession.</ParaText><ParaText id="210023">I was chatting with my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78521" Type="2">Vancouver Quadra</Affiliation>. He is a lawyer and he has some ideas in this regard. I am sure when the bill gets to committee, the question of solicitor-client privilege and how best to deal with it and whether the law adequately deals with will certainly be one of the areas where my party will want to ask questions and possibly propose amendments.</ParaText><ParaText id="210024">The third and final concern is that the bill may not adequately address privacy concerns. When the initial law was written, I believe a lot of work was done to create the appropriate balance between on the one hand the need for FINTRAC to share information with law enforcement agencies and on the other hand privacy concerns and the right to protect individuals.</ParaText><ParaText id="210025">The Auditor General in her 2003 report also commented on this. She said:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210026"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The government should assess the level of review and reporting to Parliament for security and intelligence agencies to ensure that agencies exercising intrusive powers are subject to levels of external review and disclosure proportionate to the level of intrusion.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="210027">The bill allows FINTRAC to share more information than had been the case before with law enforcement agencies. If we are to preserve the balance, then maybe, in going further in the direction of giving more information to law enforcement agencies, the bill should offer a greater measure of protection due to privacy concerns and a greater level of review, as suggested by the Auditor General, than was in the earlier law.</ParaText><ParaText id="210028">I know, for example, CSIS and it is also true for CSE, because I dealt with it when I was defence minister, have important civilian review functions. This is designed to monitor the agencies to ensure that nothing unfair or inappropriate is done and to safeguard the rights of individuals and their right to privacy. It may be that some further steps should be taken. I do not know yet what those might be. This will be another issue for the committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="210029">Of course, the Maher Arar case has brought home to Canadians the importance of this area. I think it could be important as well in the area of money laundering and terrorist financing.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210030">We support the bill in principle, but we have significant concerns in those three areas that I have mentioned. We will want to consider further in committee whether amendments would best be provided to the law. Again, those areas are as follows.</ParaText><ParaText id="210031">The first is whether the scope of the bill should be broadened to include not only cash, but in a meaningful and strong way also jewels, diamonds and other forms of wealth that can be used as a substitute for cash in money laundering and terrorist financing.</ParaText><ParaText id="210032"> Second, is the issue of solicitor-client privilege and whether the invocation of that privilege has not been so strong in the bill that we are not availing ourselves of information that the legal profession has and could help society track down terrorist financiers and money launderers.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="45">(1045)</Timestamp><ParaText id="210033">Finally, and perhaps most fundamentally, I have some concerns with the whole issue of the balance between, on the one hand, our need to get tough and track down terrorist finances and money launderers, and on the other hand, the need to protect the rights of the individual and privacy. I believe that balance has been undone by the bill and that the defence of privacy issues will need to be correspondingly strengthened.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

As people may have already figured out, I wish to say from the outset that the Bloc Québécois will support this legislation, because of the importance of the fight against terrorist financing.</ParaText><ParaText id="210399">We feel that this is a major challenge and that such a bill is necessary, particularly since the fight against organized crime has always been a priority for the Bloc Québécois. Hon. members may remember the work done by our colleague Richard Marceau, the former member of Parliament for Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier, who succeeded in having this House pass a private member's bill reversing the burden of proof in the case of the proceeds of crime.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210400">As a result of interventions by the Bloc Québécois in this House, the federal government has decided to amend the Criminal Code so that criminals now must prove that the fruits of their labour or proceeds of crime are acquired otherwise, that is, legally. Previously, the onus was on the Crown and the government to prove that criminals' income or assets were proceeds of crime. Today, the onus is reversed, and the accused must prove that he or she worked to acquire certain assets.</ParaText><ParaText id="210401">Such situations exist in Quebec, and in my riding, I have seen amazing stories that can often turn out to be terrible stories of crime. Reporters and the media have given nicknames such as “Richie Rich” or “Peter Cash” to some criminals, whose personal possessions and equipment include planes, helicopters, luxury cars and waterfront properties. These people were so nicknamed by the community, because others knew that they were involved in illegal activities and had different sources of income from their own. As well, for safety reasons, neighbours do not dare question how some people have acquired certain assets.</ParaText>

It is all very well to take action against money laundering, terrorist activities and organized crime, but we must also protect honest citizens who could end up under investigation for nothing. </ParaText><ParaText id="210422">I will provide some background, since Bill <Document DbId="2374081" Type="3">C-25</Document> did not come out of nowhere. Despite the Conservative government's good faith, it did not invent the wheel. One thing is for certain, the Conservatives did not invent Kyoto. Everyone agrees on that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210423">Bill <Document DbId="9849" Type="3">C-25</Document> is a successor to Bill <Document DbId="2154793" Type="3">C-22</Document>, which was introduced by the Liberal government and broadened the coverage of the act. Bill <Document DbId="2374081" Type="3">C-25</Document> amends Bill <Document DbId="2154793" Type="3">C-22</Document>. In other words, Bill <Document DbId="2154793" Type="3">C-22 </Document>made it mandatory for federally regulated financial institutions, currency exchange businesses, casinos and other intermediaries to report suspicious financial transactions. Suspicious financial transactions are cash deposits exceeding $7,500.</ParaText><ParaText id="210424">The former government's Bill <Document DbId="2154793" Type="3">C-22</Document> applied to financial institutions, currency exchange businesses, casinos and other financial intermediaries. The Conservative government is broadening this coverage and therefore increasing the responsibility of all agencies which, in addition to dealing in securities, also deal in other financial instruments, and of all persons and entities engaged in the business of remitting funds or transmitting funds by any means or through any person, entity or electronic funds transfer network, or of issuing or redeeming money orders, traveller’s cheques or other similar negotiable instruments.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210425">We can offer our congratulations to the Conservative government for having extended monitoring activities to include not only banks and institutions that transfer money regularly, but also to other entities that are often not openly included. This applies to electronic funds transfers and businesses that sell or purchase money orders, travellers' cheques and other negotiable items. Thus, monitoring activities have been extended. We do not want these organizations used for money laundering. I think we can support this.</ParaText><ParaText id="210426">It also extends to government departments and agents that sell precious metals under regulation. Members of the Bloc Québécois pointed out that there is some degree of illegal trade in diamonds and gold, among others, which are not necessarily liquid assets, but are precious metals that can be used as currency in money laundering.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp><ParaText id="210427">I believe that the Conservative government listened closely and covered these potential complaints from various stakeholders.</ParaText><ParaText id="210428">Previously, all the entities targeted by the legislation had to contact the centre, under section 83(1) of the Criminal Code, which sets out the obligation to inform the RCMP or CSIS of any property that belongs to a terrorist group. The new bill adds section 8 of the United Nations Suppression of Terrorism Regulations. Those entities must therefore contact the RCMP and CSIS.</ParaText><ParaText id="210429">The new bill prohibits all entities from opening an account for an individual if that person's identity cannot be established. Not only is there no obligation, entities are in fact prohibited from opening a bank account. The bank must then contact the RCMP or CSIS directly to launch an investigation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210430"> Furthermore, the bill states that prior to doing business with a politically exposed foreign person—a judge, head of state, minister or other individual who has held a specific office—the institution must obtain the approval of senior management before entering into any transaction with the individual.</ParaText><ParaText id="210431">Thus, one cannot do business with exposed persons from another country or who would be likely to carry out types of transfers or financing for terrorist activities. They are required to obtain specific authorizations from senior management of banks.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210432"> In addition, if a Canadian organization does business with a foreign bank, it is required to take measures to ensure that the foreign bank is not a shell bank, to obtain senior management approval, and to set out in writing all transactions.</ParaText><ParaText id="210433">In short, there is an obligation not only to know with whom one is doing business but also to scrutinize the banks with which one is doing business. Consequently, when a client wants to conduct transactions with foreign financial institutions, the bank is obliged to verify the credentials and to ensure that the sales, transactions or other operations are not fictitious. Its responsibility has been increased.</ParaText><ParaText id="210434">In the case of electronic funds transfers, the bank or other business must include the name, address, and the client's account number or other reference number, whether sending or receiving such transfers.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210435">Electronic funds transfers are very popular now. The old bill was implemented in 2001 by the former government, which, once again, did not do its job. The new bill has been introduced for a reason. The Liberal government did nothing for five years. It did not manage to bring a bill into being. Obviously, things have changed since then, and significant numbers of financial transactions take place through electronic funds transfers. That is why the government introduced this new bill, which covers electronic funds transfers.</ParaText><ParaText id="210436">This new bill follows the United States' lead by requiring entities to establish a program to evaluate their ability to detect transactions that involve laundering the proceeds of crime and financing terrorist activities.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210437">That is what the Bloc Québécois has trouble accepting. If we want to do what the Americans do, we should not only do what they do right, but avoid doing what they do wrong. That is why the Bloc Québécois is being so careful. This is about the ability to detect transactions that involve laundering the proceeds of crime. It would be nice to have that ability and to intervene, but we have to make sure we protect personal information.</ParaText><ParaText id="210438">Obviously, we will not be investigating. As we saw with the Maher Arar affair, we have to be careful with our investigations. Even with bank investigations, we have to be sure we have a situation that requires it. We cannot investigate just for the fun of it. We would risk arresting honest citizens who might find themselves under the microscope because we want to be just like the Americans, who figure that while they are at it, they might as well investigate a whole bunch of people. We must also avoid American-style mistakes, like casting too wide a net. They often proceed on the basis of race, religion, gender and so on. We are better off using a case-by-case approach and having really good reasons for investigating. Otherwise it is too easy to make mistakes.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210439">The members of the Bloc Québécois will continue to defend the interests of Quebeckers and ensure that the Canadian government does not make the same mistakes as the American government. Any investigations with respect to detection must be justified, not conducted without good reason. Any evaluation of certain bank transactions cannot be done carelessly, because this could lead to honest citizens being investigated without cause.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp><ParaText id="210440">Furthermore, we must ensure that no information on citizens who should not even have been investigated is shared with the United States, or any other country. In short, we must ensure that the Canadian government does not make the same mistakes as the Americans. Once again, only the Bloc Québécois can guarantee this to Quebeckers. </ParaText><ParaText id="210441">Bill <Document DbId="2374081" Type="3">C-25</Document> subjects Canadian banks' foreign subsidiaries to the same rules as the Canadian banks themselves. It was high time, because the Liberals made the mistake of allowing our Canadian banks with foreign subsidiaries to share information, even though foreign laws often do not have the same respect for privacy. This is true of American laws. </ParaText><ParaText id="210442">To that end, Revenue Canada agents will now have the authority to give the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre any information they receive from another agent, under the Charities Registration (Security Information) Act. The aim of this new authority is to better fight against the financing of terrorist groups through charitable organizations and through businesses that perform electronic funds transfers. Once again, I would like to point out that the registration of charities must be carefully monitored, although charities are normally made up of honest citizens.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210443">That is why the Bloc Québécois will fight tooth and nail for privacy and personal information protection. One may be open to the idea of all categories of organizations being monitored for money laundering, but efforts have to be made to ensure that charities, which bring together law-abiding citizens, not be subject, as they are in the United States, to a systematic analysis of their data bases or have their members subjected to money laundering analyses. </ParaText><ParaText id="210444">The Bloc Québécois will support Bill <Document DbId="2374081" Type="3">C-25</Document>, as long as honest citizens, honest Quebeckers are free from undue monitoring by government organizations eager to copy the Americans, who seem to think that, while they are at it, they might as well monitor or investigate just about everyone. We do not want that. That is not consistent with the philosophy of life and values that the citizens of Quebec have chosen for themselves. We want the privacy and personal information of honest citizens to be protected. Once again, they can count on the Bloc Québécois.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

							<ParaText id="210463">I am glad that the Bloc raised another dimension to this whole issue. It is pretty hard to deal with questions of money laundering and money lost to governments and to our revenue source without dealing with tax evasion, without dealing with the presence in our society of tax havens, something that has been a problem throughout the last decade of Liberal rule and now does not seem to be on the agenda of the present Conservatives. That is a matter with which we must deal. </ParaText><ParaText id="210464">We cannot continue to allow Canadians' hard-earned dollars to leave the country by way of tax loopholes and tax havens. I would hope that the government and the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> would be prepared to come back to this chamber with some more definitive answers to questions we have been raising for a long time about why the former prime minister, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78571" Type="2">LaSalle—Émard</Affiliation>, closed some tax loopholes and tax havens but he did not close the Barbados. He did not choose to definitively deal with the issue. Instead, he provided apparently avenues for some of his numbered companies to continue transactions through such tax havens.

							<ParaText id="210465">Bill <Document DbId="2374081" Type="3">C-25</Document> is an attempt to deal with some very serious flaws in our ability as a country to track and deal with proceeds of crime, money laundering and terrorist financing. This issue has been before us for a long time. The Auditor General has been talking about it for a good period of time, specifically since November 2004 when she put forward a report on implementation of the national initiative to combat money laundering. At that time she said that we were far from being able to deal with this problem effectively and she recommended a number of changes. </ParaText><ParaText id="210466">It is a big problem. Billions of dollars are involved. We are talking about illegal activities and money that could be used to promote illegal activities in this country and terrorist endeavours around the world. It is something we have to address and we need to do it expeditiously.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210467">The Auditor General's report is a very valuable source for analyzing the bill and for determining whether or not Bill <Document DbId="2374081" Type="3">C-25</Document> is truly in line with the Auditor General's recommendations. As a side note, it is important to note that the government says that it has respected the wishes of the Auditor General and followed the recommendations through the introduction of this legislation. We will be doing further study and research to ensure that is the case. During the committee process we will be questioning witnesses along those lines.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp><ParaText id="210468">In addition to that significant study, we now have the benefit of a major study just completed by the Senate. It put a report out this month entitled “Stemming the Flow of Illicit Money: A Priority for Canada”. The study was coordinated by the Hon. Jerry Grafstein and the Hon.

We need to know whether or not this bill actually respects and follows some of the recommendations from this report as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="210469">I want to note that in the conclusion of this report it states that Canada, as a global partner in making the world safer and more secure, must ensure that our anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regime is in line with international standards and obligations.</ParaText><ParaText id="210470">The study goes on to say:</ParaText><ParaText id="210471"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Crimes that underlie money laundering and terrorist activity financing--including fraud, embezzlement, drug trafficking and trade in arms – have harmful human, societal and economic effects, with domestic and international consequences.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="210472">That really sets the context for what we are hoping to achieve with this legislation and why we need to get this bill to committee.

							<ParaText id="210473">We are prepared to give support to the bill in principle. It may need some changes as we go through it but we certainly believe in its necessity and that it should be studied at committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="210474">However, a couple of concerns have been identified and I want to put them on the record. First, let me mention the questions raised by Democracy Watch in a release put out on October 12. This important organization, which has been an incredible watchdog for the integrity of our institutions from a democratic point of view, has called on the federal <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> to deal with a gap in the bill before us. It wants us to add senior Canadian politicians and government officials to the bank account watch list of the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada. It says that this change is recommended by the international standard setting task force, the financial action task force and, therefore, if we are bringing our legislation in line with this task force, then surely we must address this particular aspect.</ParaText><ParaText id="210475">Democracy Watch also says that it has been recommended by article 52 of the UN Convention Against Corruption. It seems that there might be a flaw in the bill that we need to look at very seriously and determine how to amend the bill to bring it in line with these international obligations.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210476">Specifically, I should probably point out that article 52 of the UN Convention Against Corruption states the following:</ParaText><ParaText id="210477"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...each State Party shall take such measures as may be necessary, in accordance with its domestic law, to require financial institutions within its jurisdiction to...conduct enhanced scrutiny of accounts sought or maintained by or on behalf of individuals who are, or have been, entrusted with prominent public functions and their family members and close associates.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="210478">Perhaps the government is leery about going this far, ensuring that actual politicians are included in this part of the legislation. </ParaText><ParaText id="210479">I would conclude by saying that there are many issues to discuss.

I wonder if she could comment on why his government tore up 11 tax treaties with different tax haven countries and left only one, the very country where the former prime minister and current member of Parliament for <Affiliation DbId="78571" Type="2">LaSalle—Émard</Affiliation> happens to have his offshore tax haven companies.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

If that is not the case, then why are we having this study and why are we dealing with it in this place?</ParaText><ParaText id="210489">This reminds me of another important loophole. We had a case before this House that the Liberals refused to deal with, which was the project loophole case. It dealt with a prominent family in this country that was taking $2 billion out of this country and flowing it offshore and avoiding paying taxes on any of that money. Officials in the Department of Finance at the time, under the Liberal government, condoned that, defended that and supported that. If anything, we need to get to the bottom of that kind of mentality and deal with it once and for all.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Martin (Winnipeg Centre)" id="1711223"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78531" Type="2">Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="210490">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Winnipeg North for sharing her time with me so I too can enter into the debate on Bill <Document DbId="2374081" Type="3">C-25</Document> dealing with money laundering and the funding of terrorists, a very pressing issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="210491"> I am glad Parliament is seized of the issue because it is something my constituents and people I know have raised with me, especially stemming from the recent information we have had. We were horrified to learn that research has recently identified that $256 million worth of illegal funds have flowed through Canada to terrorist groups. That is just what we have been able to identify and that we know about for a fact. No one is disputing those facts either, so we can attest to the veracity of those figures. Something has to be done urgently.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210492">Although my colleague has identified some reservations about the bill, I support aspects of the bill, one detail of which I would like to dwell on somewhat, and that is the issue that the proceeds of crime could be seized from someone who has been convicted of a crime. If someone is part of an illegal organization, whether that is an illegal criminal organization or an illegal terrorist organization, the government should have the right to demand to know if the things that person owns are the proceeds of crime. If that person cannot demonstrate by a reverse onus that those items were purchased with other resources, then the government should be able to seize those proceeds of crime and use that money to further resource the criminal investigation of other criminals and terrorists. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210493">That is a good idea and it is a bold idea. The NDP government in my home province of Manitoba is seeking to introduce the very same concept. Somehow we need to make it abundantly clear that crime does not pay. Law enforcement officers have conceded to the fact that under the current regime crime does pay because the burden of proof on the government, the courts and on the police is very onerous at times. Even though we know that some person is up to no good and has no other visible means of support, it is tough to prove that the luxury home in which the person lives or the luxury cars in the driveway are in fact the proceeds of crime.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210494">I say that we should give more tools to the law enforcement agencies and act on the side of the Canadian people in this case and shift that burden of proof onto the crooks. They should be telling us how they bought that luxury home when they have not had a job in 20 years. If a rich uncle died and left it in his will, then they should show us the will. If they cannot show us any other visible means of support, then we want to know how they are able to live in a mansion with all these luxury cars in the garage. We should seize those assets, send the message that crime does not pay, sell those assets and give them back to the law enforcement agencies so they can go out and bust more criminals. That is a good idea. </ParaText><ParaText id="210495">I should point out that this would be law in Manitoba today were it not for the two solitary members of the Liberal Party in the Manitoba legislature who blocked and opposed the legislation. I do not know what problem the Liberals have with this. I do not think it is any great infringement on civil rights to ask the legitimate question of where a person received the money to pay for the luxury home. If that simple question cannot be answered, then we should seize it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210496">I have a few other points to raise and I will do so in a way that I hope does not inflame the passions of the Liberals opposite. This idea of offshore tax havens has a broader context than just wholesale tax avoidance. The same logic that allowed these offshore tax havens to flourish gives licence or gives opportunity for people to funnel ill-gotten gains with less ability to track offshore as well. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp><ParaText id="210497">In the context of the bill, as we go through Bill <Document DbId="2374081" Type="3">C-25</Document> and its goals and objectives of limiting money laundering and trying to curb the financing of terrorist activity, we should be revisiting the tax treaties that have allowed Canadian businesses to avoid taxes on a rampant basis. Whatever tax regime we put in place, let us make it fair, let us make it balanced and let us make it favourable to business if we like, but at least let us make businesses pay their fair share once we have established what that rate of taxation shall be.</ParaText><ParaText id="210498"> It is such a contradiction to hear the Conservative government say that it will cut back on $1 billion worth of social spending, but then show this wilful blindness to $7 billion worth of lost tax revenue by allowing, what I call, tax fugitives to avoid paying their fair share of taxes in our country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210499">There is a polite term for it, and I know my colleague from the Liberal Party is an economist. The polite term is tax motivated expatriation. The street name for it is sleazy, tax cheating loophole. There is only one place we can still do it and it just happens to be where our former prime minister had his companies, his shell companies, his dummy companies, established so he could avoid paying his fair share of taxes in Canada. It is appalling. A Canadian prime minister should be proud to fly the Canadian flag on his ships and to pay his taxes in our country. I cannot understand the thought process that would lead him to believe otherwise. It is beyond comprehension.</ParaText><ParaText id="210500"> My colleague from the Liberal Party is helping me grope for the words to put some kind of definition to this appalling practice of tax avoidance.</ParaText><ParaText id="210501">The logic, though, about the proceeds of crime element is that any person convicted of an indictable offence at the direction of or in association with any criminal organization must demonstrate that every item of property owned by that person is not the proceeds of crime. That is just common sense to me. That is a burden with which no one in this room would have any difficulty.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210502"> If I were driving a luxury car that cost $100,000 and I had no visible means of support for the last X number of years, it is not unreasonable to ask me where I got that car. If I cannot say that I either inherited the money, or I found the money, or I dug it up in the cabbage patch or whatever story, if I am not believed, if I do not meet the test, that should be seized from me. That sends a profound message throughout the community of those who would break the law for their own personal advantage or those who would break the law in order to fund terrorism, which is even worse, that crime does not pay, at least not in Canada. I do not view that as heavy-handed or an infringement of a person's civil rights whatsoever. </ParaText><ParaText id="210503">Bill <Document DbId="2374081" Type="3">C-25</Document> gives us an opportunity to finish a job that was started in previous parliaments. I should recognize and pay tribute to the work done by my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois, Richard Marceau, who is no longer an MP. He managed to get this concept into the House of Commons in the 38th Parliament through a private member's bill. I believe, even prior to that, a Canadian Alliance member, Mr. Paul Forseth, a former colleague of ours, introduced this notion into the 37th Parliament.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210504">It has taken approximately 10 years for us to mature in our thinking about this concept or to be able to embrace this concept and not be threatened or feel afraid of this very worthwhile idea.</ParaText><ParaText id="210505">When Bill <Document DbId="2374081" Type="3">C-25</Document> deals with the proceeds of crime, it also deals with issues pertaining to the Canada Border Services Agency, which permits the new centre of financial transactions and report analysis, FINTRAC, to exchange compliance related information with its foreign counterpart. That, too, is a necessary and commonplace measure if we are to curb the international activity that does threaten our national security. That as well is a concept that we should be able to embrace and not feel threatened by.</ParaText>

The bill will strengthen the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act to ensure that Canada continues to be a global leader in combatting organized crime and terrorist financing. This is just another example of Canada taking the threat of terrorism seriously.</ParaText><ParaText id="210508">Once passed by Parliament, these changes will make Canada's overall regime consistent with international standards. The bill targets either the financial rewards from underlying crimes, such as drug dealing, prostitution and extortion, or by stopping the flow of funds to terrorist groups. </ParaText><ParaText id="210509">Money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities are serious crimes that affect all Canadians. Criminals are constantly changing their tactics and finding new ways to avoid and evade the law. Therefore, we need to make laws that will keep up with criminals and, in fact, stay ahead of them.</ParaText><ParaText id="210510">The <I>National Post</I> has reported that Canada has long been a fundraising base for international terrorist groups, from the IRA and Hezbollah to the Iranian MEK. This can simply not continue.</ParaText><ParaText id="210511">The background on this is that the foundation of this tax regime was originally set out in the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Act and then adapted to the changing global reality of terrorism. It was renamed the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act in 2001.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210512">I would like to touch on the government's four key amendments that it has set out to accomplish the updating of what it needs to do. </ParaText><ParaText id="210513">First, we are enhancing information sharing between the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada, more commonly known as FINTRAC, law enforcement and other domestic and international agencies. In fact, this group reports regularly through the House's finance committee and did so just this past month.</ParaText><ParaText id="210514">Second, we are creating a registry for money service businesses. This really speaks to ensuring we have some accountability within that registry. </ParaText><ParaText id="210515">Third, we are enabling legislation for enhanced client identification measures. We need to ensure we know who we are dealing with.</ParaText><ParaText id="210516">Fourth, we are creating an administrative and monetary penalty system to better enforce compliance with the act.</ParaText><ParaText id="210517">There is a need for why we need to do it. Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada reported in early October, as I mentioned, to the finance committee that terrorist groups funnelled an estimated $256 million through our country last year. This is up from $180 million the year before and $70 million the year before that. We are starting to identify and the bill enhances what needs to be done.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210518">There are up to 34 terrorist financing networks operating within the country. Another $4.75 billion was laundered by crime groups, which is up from the $2 billion in 2005. Recently there was the case of four Canadians with links to the University of Waterloo accused of funnelling money to the Tamil Tigers. This shows that Canada has a responsibility to its international partners to continue to crack down on terrorist financing. Canada will not be a safe haven for those who support terror.</ParaText><ParaText id="210519">How did we come to this legislation? As a founding member of the Financial Action Task Force, we are committed to implementing its regulations, including new ones released in 2003, which require this update to be made. Canada has committed to implementing the 40 recommendations of the FATF on money laundering and 9 special recommendations on terrorist financing. The bill brings our standards in line with the Auditor General's recommendations of 2004 and the Treasury Board report of 2004.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp><ParaText id="210520">Finally, it also fulfills demands of the interim report of the Senate committee on banking to implement tougher measures on money laundering and terrorist financing.</ParaText><ParaText id="210521">In Canada there is a need to balance increased vigilance and monitoring with the fundamental need to protect the privacy of Canadian citizens. This is an issue we take very seriously in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="210522">As we did with this legislation, we will continue to consult widely with Canadians. In the future, we need to ensure that a better system does not come at a price of a loss of privacy for all of our citizens.</ParaText><ParaText id="210523">As a prelude to the bill, the Department of Finance issued a consultation paper entitled, “Enhancing Canada's Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorist Financing Regime” in June 2005. Over 50 submissions from stakeholders were received followed by further face to face consultations. </ParaText><ParaText id="210524">As a result, the proposed bill contains amendments that seek to address industry concerns and minimize the compliance burden by tailoring wherever possible proposed new requirements to existing business practices.</ParaText><ParaText id="210525">The proposed legislation serves to meet Canada's international commitments to combat money laundering and terrorist financing while ensuring that our domestic regime remains robust and up to date.</ParaText><ParaText id="210526">Those who benefit from crime and steal hundreds of millions of dollars should not be allowed to drive armoured vehicles full of money and waltz over to their local banks. That is the last thing Canadians want in their country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210527">Criminals who are laundering money should do one thing. They should stew in jail about it. The government and its law and order package and its agenda will help prevent organized crime and terrorism from organizing in any of our communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="210528">Speaking to that, I come from a riding that is very close to three access points on the border. One of the commitments that we have made, both before the election and since we have taken government, is to ensure that security, whether it be RCMP or our security officers at the border, is funded, prepared and supported in order to ensure that Canadians, both in Niagara and across the country, are safe.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The first clause mentions that protection will apply only to certain persons. I think that any person who needs protection against violence must be protected. Besides, who will decide that a person has, and I quote, “reasonable grounds [to believe] that their life is in danger by reason of acts committed against them by their spouse”?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210559">My question is the following: Who will make this evaluation? Is it the RCMP, as is the case in the current program? If so, what will be done for Quebec? In Quebec, front line workers are, to name just a few, the municipal police, the Sûreté du Québec in some regions where there is no municipal police force and, of course, women's shelters. </ParaText><ParaText id="210560">What will be done? Will there be a situation where people who are already the victims of violence will have to deal with administrative red tape, that is the famous reverse pyramid? Indeed, although it may take months before women are protected, it takes only a few seconds to get a bullet in the head. </ParaText><ParaText id="210561">Also, there is absolutely nothing in this bill that deals with child protection. Generally, when it comes to women, sometimes they have children with them, sometimes not. I greatly appreciate my Conservative Party colleague's generosity and desire to protect women. However, I will give him a few little ideas that are concrete and that would help protect women. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210562">First, why does he not ask the <Affiliation DbId="78766" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Heritage and Status of Women</Affiliation> to give back the famous $5 million a year that she wants to cut from Status of Women Canada? We know that, in 2007, this $5 million a year will be taken from the funds of Status of Women Canada. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp><ParaText id="210563">Why does he not ask his minister to take appropriate action? A $5 million a year cut to Status of Women Canada's budget means $5 million less to fight violence against women and children. Those are concrete measures. </ParaText><ParaText id="210564">If the member is so passionate about the issue of violence against women, I am willing to meet the Prime Minister with him, if he so wishes. I am even willing to meet his whole caucus to make his colleagues understand the importance of the gun registry. The importance of this registry is obvious. Any woman, any man, anyone in Quebec will tell you that it is very important. Indeed, the registry has led to a reduction in the number of homicides against women and children. In the case of women, the reduction was 31%. </ParaText><ParaText id="210565">I do not think that we want to resemble the United States. We do not want the right to bear arms to be a constitutional right. People in Quebec and in Canada want the right to life to be a constitutional right. That is the right they want, not the right to bear arms and to line the pockets of the gun lobby. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210566">I urge the hon. member to review, along with his government, not only their perception of crime, but also the means used to fight it. We all want to eliminate this plague. Unfortunately, the means currently used by this government will not achieve that goal. </ParaText><ParaText id="210567">I wish to make another point. Prevention is critical in the fight against any form of crime, whether we are dealing with violence against women, youth, street gangs, organized crime or terrorism. Prevention, measures to fight exclusion and poverty, and efforts to reconcile work and family are all effective ways to fight crime. Building jails and imposing stiffer penalties will not do the job. In fact, the longer people are behind bars, the more criminalized they become. Any criminologist can confirm that. Any self-respecting criminologist knows that penitentiaries are, quite simply, universities for criminals. </ParaText><ParaText id="210568">I will conclude by saying that it is not going to be easy for the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78459" Type="2">Lévis—Bellechasse</Affiliation> to convince his government that it should view crime from a new perspective. In any case, he should never forget that we were sent here, in this House, by the public, and that we should only be accountable to that public. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I would like to applaud my hon. colleague for bringing forward this important matter. Sponsoring such a thoughtful bill, he has demonstrated his personal concern for one of our most troubling challenges as a society, the abuse of spouses by their partners. </ParaText><ParaText id="210570">As a society we have come a long way. We have developed a much better understanding of this issue and as a consequence, we are taking real and meaningful steps to address it. The debate we are having today is more evidence of a concern that is widely shared. </ParaText><ParaText id="210571">A caring society must ensure that its citizens are able to go about their daily affairs with a reasonable expectation of personal safety. As lawmakers, we cannot guarantee complete safety to every individual, particularly behind the four walls of their homes. However, we can take steps to increase the overall level of safety of Canadians, and that is exactly what Canada's new government is determined to achieve. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210572">As hon. members will recall, the Speech from the Throne designated attack on crime and the protection of communities as two of the government's five main priorities.</ParaText><ParaText id="210573">Budget 2006 pledged $161 million to hire 1,000 new RCMP personnel and federal prosecutors to focus on such law enforcement priorities as drugs, corruption and border security. Another $20 million was earmarked for various youth crime prevention initiatives with a focus on guns, gangs and drugs. Our government has also promised $26 million for a range of initiatives for victims of crimes, including the establishment of a victims ombudsman for matters within federal jurisdiction.</ParaText><ParaText id="210574">The government is also examining such issues as the length and terms of custodial sentences. In particular, as the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> has committed, the government introduced legislation to address sentences for dangerous offenders, particularly those convicted of sexual or violent offences. </ParaText><ParaText id="210575">Such initiatives will do much to enhance the safety of our streets and to increase the confidence of Canadians. Can we do more? Yes we can. As the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78459" Type="2">Lévis—Bellechasse</Affiliation> proposes, we can amend one of our existing laws to bring greater protection to a particular vulnerable group.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210576">Under the bill before us, the Witness Protection Program Act would be amended, so as to extend to victims of spousal abuse the kind of protection afforded to men and women who endanger their lives by testifying as witnesses for the Crown. In order to weigh the merits of the proposals before us, permit me to expand a bit more on the witness protection program.</ParaText><ParaText id="210577">The RCMP has been engaged in witness protection activities since the 1980s, initially for informants contributing to the breakup of narcotics rings. This authority was formalized in 1996 with the passage of the Witness Protection Program Act, which allows the RCMP to protect witnesses to any inquiry, investigation or prosecution that places them at substantial risk. Typically, these witnesses are testifying in cases involving major organized crime, national security, terrorism, and so on.</ParaText><ParaText id="210578">The question then becomes, is it appropriate, feasible or indeed necessary to broaden the witness protection program to also protect victims of spousal abuse? In considering this question, we need to begin with some context.</ParaText><ParaText id="210579">According to the Government of Canada's 2004 general social survey, an estimated 7% of Canadians aged 15 and older had experienced spousal violence in the previous five years. While nearly as many men as women reported that they were victims of domestic abuse, it is noteworthy that the scope of their experience is different.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210580">Female victims, for instance, were three times more likely than men to fear for their lives and to lose time from their everyday activities. Women were also much more likely to report that they were the targets of more than 10 violent incidents and suffered bodily injury.</ParaText><ParaText id="210581">What do people in that situation really need? The answer to that question is as varied as the cases. In general, victims of domestic violence need a range of interventions, from information, counselling and social support, to emergency shelter and medical attention. Some need to get away altogether. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp><ParaText id="210582">For some, fleeing a life-threatening situation, only a whole new identity will save them. Such a solution is of course always an absolute last resort. It is a complex task and drastic desperate measure. It starts with a new name, but it is so much more than that. There is a new home, a new community and a new job. Gone is everything that the person once had such as friends, colleagues, a personal history and often even a family.</ParaText><ParaText id="210583">Fortunately, in Canada victims of violence do not have to walk that path alone. Some, as I mentioned earlier, are eligible for the protection by the RCMP under the witness protection program. The Government of Canada also works with its provincial and territorial partners, police, and a variety of social agencies to ensure that victims of family violence gain access to the services and supports that they need. These services may be delivered right in the victim's home community. Alternatively he or she may need help to relocate.</ParaText><ParaText id="210584">In assessing the intent of Bill <Document DbId="2196419" Type="4">C-286</Document> several questions come to mind. For example, are those who fear for their lives at the hands of a dangerous partner sufficiently well-served by existing programs and also by social services that might exist at the provincial, territorial or local levels?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210585">For one thing, the program is a tool for law enforcement officers operating in a context of crime investigation. As such, might it lack a focus on social intervention and support which are often important to domestic abuse cases? </ParaText><ParaText id="210586">Such social interventions, moreover, fall under the jurisdiction of provincial and territorial agencies, and we must determine whether it is inappropriate for the Government of Canada to manage their activities under federal law. </ParaText><ParaText id="210587">Finally, there is the issue of resources. We must assess whether the RCMP has the capacity to manage a substantial increase in the number of individuals afforded protection under the witness protection program. If the focus of the program were to change, would officers working on domestic abuse cases need to receive further training which would add to the cost?</ParaText><ParaText id="210588">There are few obligations of government more grave than the duty to protect and defend society's most vulnerable. Victims of domestic abuse need support and practical aid, including, in the most serious cases, assistance in leaving their abusers.</ParaText><ParaText id="210589">Addressing those needs is not easy. Programs must be developed and delivered in a way that will genuinely help victims, not inadvertently expose them to new dangers. In that context, I want to reiterate my appreciation for the initiative demonstrated by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78459" Type="2">Lévis—Bellechasse.</Affiliation></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210590">The remedy he proposes in Bill <Document DbId="2196419" Type="4">C-286</Document> is thoughtful. It underscores his profound concern for a truly worthwhile cause and it merits the respect of further debate and deliberation. This deliberation must also weigh the utility of the witness protection program as a tool to address domestic abuse, the jurisdictional implications of its use, and the resources available to law enforcement bodies that might wish to use it.</ParaText><ParaText id="210591">I do, however, thank my hon. colleague for bringing this matter to the floor of the House of Commons in the hope that it will receive due consideration in the very near future.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Maloney" id="1711330"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78608" Type="2">Mr. John Maloney (Welland, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="210592">Mr. Speaker, Bill <Document DbId="2196419" Type="4">C-286</Document> would amend the Witness Protection Act to include spouses whose lives are in danger because of the action of their spouse, which is defined to include former spouse, common law partner or former common law partner. A common law partner is a person who has cohabited in a conjugal relationship with another person for a period of not less than one year. </ParaText><ParaText id="210593">Violence against women remains a serious social problem, despite advances in public awareness, support services and judicial and policy responses such as peace bonds, firearm prohibition orders, incarceration, no contact communication orders, restraining orders. To an irrational abuser, however, civil remedies, such as supervisory orders, custody orders for children or division of matrimonial property, may exacerbate a situation to the point where the only final recourse for the victim's spouse and her children is to escape the threat of personal harm by disappearing.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210594">A commentary on Bill <Document DbId="2196419" Type="4">C-286</Document> points out that this proposed legislation will introduce a subtle yet important shift in the rationale for the witness protection program. The existing program is to promote law enforcement by protecting witnesses who are in personal jeopardy because of their involvement in police activities. The proposed bill will add a related but separate purpose, the protection of persons who believe their lives to be in danger from their spouse or former spouse. This protection for individuals would be a goal of its own and not directly related to broader police activities.</ParaText><ParaText id="210595">I have no doubt that all members of the House agree that support for victims of domestic violence is needed and most commendable. The act will, however, be meaningless unless additional financial resources are committed to cover the expanded role of the federal government and the RCMP. </ParaText><ParaText id="210596">Currently, spouses who are in such danger that they feel they must flee their surroundings and change their identities do now have some measure of protection under a little known ad hoc process called new identities, unless this has been a victim of the Conservative government's latest round of cuts to federal programs.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210597">With the help of information from police, women's shelters and victims groups, the program assists desperate women in life-threatening situations gain a new identity and relocate by providing them with new social insurance numbers and ensuring continuity of federal social benefits such as employment insurance. This does prevent some devious predators from surreptitiously tracking down their estranged spouse. However, with no separate funding sources, the assistance provided is not comprehensive and falls far short of its aims and objectives, which leads us to the need for this act.</ParaText><ParaText id="210598"> Bill <Document DbId="2196419" Type="4">C-286</Document> would also provide a new solid base for the new identities program.</ParaText><ParaText id="210599"> Subclause 7(2) of the bill sets out the factors which should be considered in the case of admitting a spouse to the program. They include: the nature of risk to the security of the spouse; the nature of the injuries caused to the spouse by the severe psychological damage inflicted on the spouse by the other spouse and the criminal record, if any, of the other spouse; the circumstances that cause the spouse to believe that his or her life is in danger; alternative methods of protecting the spouse without admitting the spouse to the program; and such other factors as the commissioner deems relevant.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210600">Unless the criteria for entry are somewhat strict, the program could result in an unmanageable situation in which applicants flood the system. Spouses would have to believe, on reasonable grounds, that their life was in danger by reason of acts committed against them by their spouse and would have to be recommended for admission by a law enforcement agency, which could also include government departments.</ParaText><ParaText id="210601">Participation in a spousal witness protection program must be well thought out by a prospective candidate who must appreciate both the short term and long term complications. If elements of organized crime are a threat, one is most happy to disappear without a trace. Under the spousal program there is the family dynamic of parents, siblings, grandparents left behind, which could complicate matters. Children who, with the passage of time, may forget or play down the violence and abusive behaviour of the parent left behind, may work to reconnect with the parent, thereby blowing the cover of this protective veil after much time, effort and expense.</ParaText><ParaText id="210602">In most cases, under the current program, the RCMP erases all traces of a witness' former identity, moves the persons to a new province, pays for job re-training and provides money for re-establishment. A handful of abuse victims have been admitted to the existing program, but mainly for those who have testified against their partners.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210603">When we consider the tremendous number of victims of domestic abuse and violence in our country, one can readily appreciate that there could be much take up under these programs and the funding necessary for the programs would be substantial. At the present time, the witness protection program costs range from $400,000 to $500,000 per witness, which is very significant.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="50">(1350)</Timestamp><ParaText id="210604"> As this bill entails expenditures of money, I hope that the sponsor of the bill has sought an opinion on whether a royal recommendation is required, and if so, that the Conservative government will in fact support such a recommendation. The costs in and of themselves should not defeat an initiative that is worthy of further consideration.</ParaText><ParaText id="210605">Although it goes beyond the scope of the proposed legislation, serious consideration should be given by this government to working with our provincial partners to provide additional resources to deal with preventive measures and sound programs to get at the root causes of domestic abuse and violence, whether they be programs for counselling in alcohol and drug abuse, anger management, debt management, stress management, gender sensitivity--something we did not see much of on the other side of the House yesterday--marriage counselling, or other interventions that may prevent violent and abusive behaviour. This wish list is extensive but so necessary if we are truly to address the issue of spousal abuse and violence. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210606">We must assist the service and delivery providers throughout this country with much needed resources, either indirectly through the provinces in our social transfers, or directly to the social agencies for assistance programs that do not offend the federal-provincial jurisdictional responsibilities. The bottom line is that the groups and organizations on the front lines need help and financial assistance, help that will pay dividends in diminishing the demand and the need for extensive utilization of a spousal witness protection program.</ParaText><ParaText id="210607">One of these front line agencies in my riding of Welland is Women's Place of South Niagara, a crisis centre and provider of shelter for women and their children who are victims of domestic abuse and violence. Its doors are open to those who are forced to flee their residences, often in emergency situations, and sometimes with just the clothes on their backs, in order to protect themselves from serious injury or worse at the hands of a physically aggressive spouse or common law partner.</ParaText><ParaText id="210608">Occasionally an intervention of this nature is the catalyst to defuse an increasingly violent relationship, allowing the parties to reassess such a relationship and either to proceed to a more amicable or at least rational separation or to work to a possible reconciliation and a new respect for one another. Too often this is not enough. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210609">I have listened with astonishment and horror to the anecdotes of abused women from the shelter who are brave enough to tell their stories anonymously. I question how our society allows such situations to occur and why there are not the resources for prompt interventions. It is a sobering fact to learn that some women, for many different reasons, endure up to 30 incidents of abusive behaviour before they seek help to leave an abusive relationship for a much better life.</ParaText><ParaText id="210610">Some advocates for victims of domestic abuse and violence would like to see a totally new program of protection with decisions of acceptance into the program being managed or reviewed by professionals trained and skilled in making assessments of abused women and children, instead of leaving it to the RCMP to decide which victims need protection. Their concern is that the policing authorities could limit their choices to victims of abusers who have been criminally convicted of a serious related criminal offence. Police involvement would still be required but augmented by the input of trained professionals.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210611">In this discussion I also wish to point out that legally acquired rifles and shotguns are the weapons of choice in cases of domestic homicide. It has been pointed out that guns are frequently part of the cycle of intimidation and violence that many victims face in their homes. For every woman who loses her life at the hand of a spouse with a firearm, there are thousands who are threatened or live in fear. In fact, one shelter worker with the Alberta Council of Women's Shelters estimated that at least 30% of her clients had been threatened with a gun. The opponents of licensing and registration tend to come from regions where guns are more common, such as rural communities and the west. Ironically, these regions are also where firearms figure more prominently in incidents of domestic violence.</ParaText><ParaText id="210612">The Firearms Act introduced measures for licensing of gun owners and registration of firearms. Coupled with appropriate training and implementation, these measures are essential to removing firearms from situations where women are at risk. Licensing of gun owners is essential to keep guns away from potentially abusive spouses or individuals with a history of violence.</ParaText><ParaText id="210613">I would hope that the sponsor of the bill would urge his government not to proceed with its commitment to gut the firearms program. Protection of women and children from domestic abuse includes much more than including them in a witness protection program.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="210614">The inclusion of spouses in the witness protection program is the last, the final safety net in cases where counselling and criminal law have been ineffective. Women who fall into this category must be given this opportunity to save their lives and those of their children. That is why I will support this bill moving to committee stage for a full consideration, including the testimony of knowledgeable witnesses.</ParaText>
