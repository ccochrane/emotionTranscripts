Canadians are writing and phoning in saying that very clearly. In the constituency meetings we are having across the country, I know every member of Parliament has had people approach them about this deal. I certainly I have in my riding. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2986794">What the NDP is saying is that there needs to be public consultations on this deal. Before the government moves to rubber-stamp, it should consult the public. That is what we are saying today and that is where we are hoping to get support from all members of Parliament in the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="2986795">Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with our terrific industry critic, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170376" Type="2">LaSalle—Émard</Affiliation>.

							<ParaText id="2986797">It is only fair to listen to what the public knows so far of this particular application. An opinion poll just a few days ago indicated that about 70% of Canadians oppose this deal. </ParaText><ParaText id="2986798">Mr. Speaker, you know, because you are very well versed in these matters, that the majority of chief executives who are polled are opposing this deal unless they can see stringent conditions. I will get back to that in a moment. There are real concerns about the government's ability to even put in place the kind of conditions that are required. </ParaText><ParaText id="2986799">We are seeing concerns raised by the public and in boardrooms across the country. We have even heard concerns raised in the Conservative caucus.</ParaText><ParaText id="2986800">For all of those reasons, the NDP is presenting a motion today that would allow for the type of considered discussion around this issue that needs to take place. We are saying that there should not be a rubber-stamp placed on this “without conducting thorough public consultations”; that the House should direct the government to “immediately undertake transparent and accessible public hearings into the issue of foreign ownership in the Canadian energy sector with particular reference to the impact of state-owned enterprises”; and that the government “must respect its 2010 promise to clarify in legislation the concept of 'net benefit' within the Investment Canada Act”.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2986801">That is what we have put forward. Certainly no Conservative member of Parliament could oppose a commitment that was made to Canadians both in a previous House and in a previous election campaign.</ParaText>

At that time, the industry critic, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170376" Type="2">LaSalle—Émard</Affiliation>, and I rose in a press conference to say very clearly that the commitments undertaken in 2010 needed to be brought forward in 2012 because the application was pending.

When the formal application came forward, the 45-day period started and we are now only a few days from the point when the government should be making an enlightened decision, given the importance of the file and the many letters and phone calls we are receiving from, and conversations we are having with, our constituents. </ParaText><ParaText id="2986818">It is a few days away. Has anything been done by the government to reinforce that commitment made two years ago? </ParaText><ParaText id="2986819"><B>Some hon. members:</B> No.</ParaText><ParaText id="2986820"><B>Mr. Peter Julian:</B> There we go. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2986821">What we have seen is a failure on the part of the government to keep that commitment of two years ago. The NDP provided clear direction. Every single member of the House of Commons said yes, that it was the direction in which the country should go. The government needed to take this direction from the House of Commons, and for two years nothing has been done.</ParaText><ParaText id="2986822">Two months ago the application was pending. We knew that. Did the government snap to attention and start working? No. No work has been done. Now we are only a few days away from a decision that we would expect to be enlightened and emboldened by full public consultation, yet we have not seen anything.</ParaText><ParaText id="2986823">This is the fundamental problem. We have the public on one hand saying that they are learning more and more about this takeover and that they are concerned about it. We also have chief executives and those in the boardroom saying that they are looking at this and are becoming more and more concerned. We even have Conservatives raising this issue, but we have seen no leadership at all from the government.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2986824">If today the Conservatives vote against this motion, it would be a rejection and repudiation of a solemn commitment made to the Canadian public two years ago when they voted for that motion by Jack Layton. It would be a repudiation of what is clearly the public's desire to be consulted about this takeover and the whole issue of takeovers in the energy sector generally, particularly by state-owned companies.</ParaText><ParaText id="2986825">It would also be a clear repudiation of a commitment made by every Conservative MP to clarify the net benefit test and to engage public confidence in that test, which has clearly eroded because there has been no definition of net benefit, and also to set in place a level playing field for investors so they would understand the criteria they have to meet when applying for a takeover.</ParaText>

In particular, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170466" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation> as the critic for the Liberal Party has expressed great concern about foreign ownership and has called upon the government to provide information and some form of a protocol that would ultimately ensure that industries in Canada, particularly our natural resource industries, are watched over in a very prudent fashion. </ParaText><ParaText id="2986828">The government itself has been negligent in providing guidance on foreign investment.

We know there were 10,000 foreign investment applications approved when the Liberals were in power, all of them rubber stamped. They never rejected a single one and never attached conditions; they just let those takeovers accumulate. I am very happy they will be supporting this motion today. It is an important step in their rehabilitation.</ParaText><ParaText id="2986830">I do want to mention, because it is relevant and pertinent, the foreign investment promotion and protection agreement that was released just a few days ago . It gives even more cause for real alarm. When we look at how this FIPA was structured, it is quite different from other FIPA agreements signed with other countries. The government has negotiated a one-sided agreement that is clearly in favour of the Chinese government's proposals around FIPA. It is not the standard Canadian template for a FIPA. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2986831">It provides what is essentially a one-sided acquisition and expansion ability. Canadian companies will not have the same rights in China as a result of this FIPA, as they would if they were already established there. Companies already established here, particularly Chinese companies, actually have more rights than those moving into the Canadian economy. It is a one-sided deal with a secretive arbitration process, and it is quite literally a red flag about how the Conservative government negotiates these types of agreements and does not act in Canada's best interests.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Frankly, I am concerned because I do not think the NDP, in principle, understands who actually owns a company like Nexen.

While a company files an application for review under the Investment Canada Act, the <Affiliation DbId="170695" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> will conduct a thorough review of the proposed investment. Under the act, where any investment, including the one the hon. members opposite mentioned, is subject to review, the Minister of Industry must approve an investor's application for review before an investor can implement an acquisition. An application for review is only approved where the Minister of Industry is satisfied, based on the plans, undertakings and other representations of the investor, that the investment is likely to give net benefit to Canada. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2986884">In making that determination of net benefit, the minister considers the factors listed in section 20 of the act. </ParaText><ParaText id="2986885">Among these factors is the effect of the investment on the level and nature of economic activity in Canada, including the effect on employment, on resource processing, on the utilization of parts, components and services produced in Canada and on exports from Canada. Another factor is the degree and significance of participation by Canadians and Canadian business, or new Canadian business, and in any industry or industries in Canada of which the Canadian business or new Canadian business forms or would form a part. Another factor is the effect of the investment on productivity, industrial efficiency, technological development, product innovation and product variety in Canada. Another is the effect of the investment on competition within any industry or industries in Canada. There is also the compatibility of the investment with national, industrial, economic and cultural policies, taking into consideration industrial, economic and cultural policy objectives stated by the government or legislature of any province likely to be significantly affected by the investment. Also there is the contribution of the investment to Canada's ability to compete in world markets.</ParaText>

Maxime Bernier (Minister of State (Small Business and Tourism), CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2986933">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise today to discuss with my opposition colleagues, both Liberal and New Democrat, the motion before the House related to foreign investment in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="2986934">In general, the foreign investments made in Canada by outside companies are very beneficial to the Canadian economy. Our government is open to foreign investment. The <Affiliation DbId="170695" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> currently has before him a proposed foreign investment that he is analyzing under the Investment Canada Act. I would like to remind hon. members that this legislation was passed in 1985 by Brian Mulroney's Conservative government, which wanted to promote foreign investment and support Canadian corporations so that they could invest abroad. There is reciprocity in this area: if we prevent foreign companies from investing in Canada, then Canadian companies that want to invest abroad may also be prevented from doing so.</ParaText><ParaText id="2986935">At the time, in 1985, the Conservative government felt that these investments were important to the creation of jobs and the generation of wealth in Canada. The government abolished the Foreign Investment Review Act brought in by the Liberal government of the time, which did not believe that foreign investment was beneficial for Canada. This legislation now includes a test to ensure that foreign investment will benefit all Canadians.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2986936">In this time of global economic uncertainty outside our borders, many European countries are currently in a recession. The Americans have a enormous deficit and a giant debt. Given that Canadian entrepreneurs export their products to these markets, we must continue to support investment because it generates wealth. Production is what makes a country grow richer. We can buy only what has been first produced by entrepreneurs. We must promote production and investment—the driving force behind Canada's economy—rather than spending, as some members of the opposition think.</ParaText><ParaText id="2986937">The economic plan that we implemented two years ago is working. Canada is experiencing economic growth. This growth is somewhat fragile because job creators, that is entrepreneurs, export their products abroad and the economic situation in other countries could impact Canada's growth.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2986938">For that reason, we must focus on creating jobs and wealth for Canadians. That is what we have done in our latest budgets, thereby showing that Canada is the best country to invest in. Canada is open for business and it invites Canadians and foreigners to invest in it to create wealth.</ParaText><ParaText id="2986939">What is more, Canada is the best country in the G7. Canadian entrepreneurs have created more than 600,000 new jobs since the end of the last recession. Our corporate tax rate is the lowest among the G7 countries. That is important if we want to attract foreign investors who create wealth. The International Monetary Fund continues to rank Canada among the top countries in terms of economic growth and investment. Even <I>Forbes Magazine</I>, the famous business magazine, says that Canada is the best place to invest and to do business. All that is good news for all Canadians because it is people from the private sector who create jobs.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2986940">Unlike the opposition, we know that governments do not create jobs; entrepreneurs are the ones who create jobs and wealth. We must encourage them to do so, including by cutting corporate tax rates. When we came to power, the corporate tax rate was 22%. We have considerably reduced that rate. A lower tax rate is important because it leaves businesses with more money to develop their projects, export their products and enter new markets.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="00">(1100)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2986941">Taxing a corporation impedes the creation of wealth because it means taxing investment and production. We must concentrate on reducing taxes, contrary to what the NDP is proposing to do.</ParaText><ParaText id="2986942">The NDP election platform contains its solution to wealth creation: tax Canadians more, and make them spend more and go into debt when they have maxed out their credit cards. It is right there in black and white.</ParaText><ParaText id="2986943">Canadians know that when they have maxed out their credit cards, they must pay their debts. The NDP is urging Canadians to live beyond their means and urging the government to live beyond its means. The NDP wants to continue imposing taxes and encouraging debt, which will leave future generations with a poisoned gift.</ParaText><ParaText id="2986944">We must not tax corporations and we must not impose a carbon tax of $20 billion or more. The NDP is advocating this tax, which will affect families and Canadian consumers.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2986945">I mentioned that a tax affects families, but it is important to say that taxing corporations is like taxing individuals because we know that businesses compete with one another. If corporations were made to pay a carbon tax, as the NDP would like, production costs would increase.</ParaText><ParaText id="2986946">A business must be profitable in order to provide investors with a return on their investment. We are investors, through our pension funds invested in Canadian corporations. If a corporation has to pay an additional cost, it will pass on this cost to consumers by increasing the price of its goods or products, or to its shareholders by decreasing the return on their investment, or to the workers that the NDP wants to protect by not giving them a wage increase. </ParaText><ParaText id="2986947">Depending on the competitive environment in which the corporation operates, the individual will always pay the corporation's taxes. It is not true that corporate taxes and personal taxes are two separate taxes. It is one and the same and people know it.</ParaText><ParaText id="2986948">A $20 million carbon tax on corporations is a tax on individuals. At the end of the day, Canadians are all consumers, workers and investors through their pension funds. Thus, personal income tax will rise.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2986949">A company is merely a network, a cluster of contracts between suppliers, workers and customers. In a free and democratic country and in all countries, the real individuals are those who pay corporate income tax. That is why the NDP's plan must not be implemented. It would cause a great deal of harm to Canada's economic growth.</ParaText><ParaText id="2986950">I would like to add that it is possible for a foreign investment to be made in Canada or for a company to want to buy shares in a Canadian company. We live in a free country where property rights exist. If shareholders of such a company make a basically unanimous decision to sell their shares, why would the government interfere in a private decision?</ParaText><ParaText id="2986951">The general principle that we must remember is that, if individuals decide to sell their shares, it is because it is in their interest and thus in the interest of Canadians to do so.</ParaText><ParaText id="2986952">When the Government of Canada uses legislation to prevent shareholders from selling their shares, the message we are sending shareholders is that, if they invest in a company, they risk being unable to sell their shares later because the government could intervene. </ParaText>

							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="2986971">The Liberal Party understands the need for foreign investment. It is important for the creation of economic growth and for the creation of jobs. </ParaText><ParaText id="2986972">We also note that studies have shown that foreign investment tends to increase innovation in a country. It is valuable and important for Canada. If there is a lot of foreign direct investment out of Canada, that is important to our economy. It creates wealth and jobs at home because there are returns from that. Head offices are based here that are important employers and they create good jobs in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="2986973">Our position is not like the position of the NDP over the years. That party has long been opposed to free trade and foreign investment. It has opposed foreign investments over and over again. These days all of a sudden those members are trying to present some sort of a new face, a different picture, that they are not going to look quite so economically irresponsible, but rather make it look as though they are being a little more open to these things. Although they are trying to bury the past, Canadians are not buying it so far, but we will have to wait and see.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2986974">The Liberal Party has been asking for weeks for answers from the government about this deal. It is clear the government does not know what it is doing in this case, or else maybe it is afraid to tell Canadians what it is doing, what its plans are, how it is going to manage this, or perhaps both.</ParaText><ParaText id="2986975">As a result of the government's economic incompetence, Canadians really are not confident that they can be assured of being protected by the Conservative government.</ParaText><ParaText id="2986976"> Let us remember that the Conservatives inherited the best fiscal situation of any new government coming into office, with a $13 billion surplus in 2006 and they turned that into a deficit before the recession began in 2008. By April and May 2008, the country was already in deficit again. The government entered that year with a deficit of over $5 billion and it had not even begun spending on stimulus at that point. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2986977">The Conservatives claim they have had a good record economically. I think most Canadians recognize that is not the case. Therefore, it is hard for them to have the kind of confidence they are looking for that the government will deal with a matter like this properly. For this and other reasons, as well as their failure to be open about this, there is a growing level of cynicism over this deal. The actions of the Conservatives are a major contributing factor to that cynicism and to the concerns Canadians have about this.</ParaText><ParaText id="2986978">The report from CSIS talks about foreign companies, state-owned companies. It does not specify this instance, but it talks about how these kind of deals could create security concerns. That has obviously created a lot of concern for Canadians as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="2986979">The public has expressed reservations about this deal because the government has failed to be open, despite repeated promises. A moment ago my hon. colleague talked about some changes the Conservatives made in 2009 in relation to a bit of tinkering around security questions. In 2010, a year after that, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said that we needed a clearer, more transparent process, yet we have seen nothing since then. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2986980">The government sat on this question knowing full well that proposals like this would come forward. We have been hearing lots of talk in the oil sands, in the west and elsewhere, of foreign interests and takeovers. For the government to say that it was not ready, that it did not know it was coming and that it did not even prepare for this, makes no sense. </ParaText><ParaText id="2986981">I am delighted to be splitting my time with my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170158" Type="2">Malpeque</Affiliation>. I look forward to hearing him on this topic in a few minutes.</ParaText><ParaText id="2986982">We even see growing dissent on the government backbenches. There is clear division on that side. Even the backbench members are concerned about where the government is headed. Maybe they too find it awfully difficult to see where the government is headed on this because it has not been transparent. Apparently there is a dispute about this even in cabinet. The member for <Affiliation DbId="170305" Type="2">Calgary West</Affiliation> seems to be the poster boy for opponents to the deal, but he certainly is not the only one to question what the government is doing on foreign investment.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2986983">It is something Canadians have been wondering about for years, ever since the fiscally incompetent crowd over there took power in 2006, because during that period we witnessed a hollowing out of the natural resources sector in this country. Lots of former leaders in that sector are now gone and owned elsewhere. Think about aluminum; think about steel; think about metal. Big companies in these sectors, important Canadian companies, have all been gobbled up by foreign owners. The companies, since then, have failed to live up to their commitments, and the government has not held them to those commitments. The government lacked the fortitude to enforce the commitments that were in those deals.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2986984">How can Canadians have any confidence in what the government will do with the next deal, that it will enforce any conditions that may apply to the CNOOC Nexen deal? Of course it probably should not surprise us that the government lacked the fortitude to enforce even the basic promises made in some of those deals when we know about the government's own record for keeping promises. Seniors remember the broken promise from the government and the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> on income trusts. Voters remember the fixed date election law, and that promise was broken. All Canadians these days are paying more and more because of the broken gas tax promise. The Prime Minister said whenever gas prices rise above 85¢ we will get rid of the tax, which would alleviate the challenge for Canadians paying for that. That is another broken promise.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2986985">We have a <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> who has made a habit of failing to live up to his promises or to keep a promise, so how is he likely to ask others to do so? It does not seem very likely. In fact, part of the problem we are dealing with today is a direct result of the Prime Minister failing to keep his promise to review and update the Investment Canada Act and to provide a clearer process. There are a number of ways of doing it. One option is by making amendments to the net benefit test. Another is to ask if there is some other process we should use entirely. Do we use one that still leaves it to the discretion of the government in the end, or do we find something else that removes that discretion? That is what we ought to be discussing. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2986986">One of the reasons we are supporting the motion today is that we believe it is important to have a public discussion about this. It is important to have members of Parliament at committee discussing these issues. As my good friend from <Affiliation DbId="170466" Type="2">Wascana</Affiliation> recently pointed out, the six-step test for net benefit in section 20 of the Investment Canada Act remains a very foggy test. It is not all that clear. In any given case, net benefit is what the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> decides, despite all the things listed in section 20. It changes from deal to deal. As we saw with the potash deal a couple of years ago, we know decisions are based on political expediency. It was clear the government wanted to go ahead with that deal, but it finally backed down.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2986987">We do not have a clearly defined set of regulations. Is that the way to go? Do we need a different process that takes it out of the hands of the cabinet? Or do we want to leave some flexibility in government on these decisions? That is the kind of thing that a committee of Parliament ought to be studying. I had a motion passed last spring after waiting quite a while, adopted by the industry committee to look at this, but we are still not at it and we have a situation in this Parliament where committees go in camera so the government can avoid dealing with things it does not want to deal with.</ParaText><ParaText id="2986988">This is a case where the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said in 2010 he wanted to deal with this, he wanted this study. The <Affiliation DbId="170695" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> said a year and a half ago that the committee ought to be looking at this. Well, who has a majority on the committee? Has the government really allowed the industry committee to study this question, if it has not happened? It has the majority. It controls the agenda and yet the committee has not studied this issue. We know who is in control of that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2986989">The unfortunate truth is that, because of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s failure to keep a promise again, there will be a lot more potential takeovers that will be decided on this very sketchy basis, and that is economic mismanagement to add to the Conservatives' fiscal mismanagement. The sad truth is that the government has not done its homework on this deal even though it had plenty of time to prepare for this kind of situation, the same way it failed to do its homework on the northern gateway pipeline proposal as we heard from former Conservative minister Jim Prentice this very week. He talked about how they totally failed to consult aboriginal communities, how they have not lived up to their responsibilities.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

That is the key here. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987001">We ought to make sure that there is a process in place, that conditions can be put and enforced against these companies, that there are the proper enforcement mechanisms to ensure those conditions are enforced, so that this kind of investment gives Canada the kind of benefit we want to see in terms of job creation, development of our economy, and innovation. We have seen that there is a lot of past history showing there are benefits from foreign direct investment in this country. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987002">Another topic for perhaps another time is the kind of investment we have elsewhere.

Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2987007">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on this motion, which just like yesterday's motion on employment insurance, is quite reasonable. I certainly believe MPs from all sides of the House should be able to stand up in their place and support it. It is not going against government policy. It is, in fact, doing reasonable things for Canadians and doing the proper study.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987008">We all know that the government has failed, as has been mentioned by many speakers, in its commitment to lay out the rules on foreign investment in Canada, which it committed to do following the attempted takeover of Saskatchewan potash some two years ago. There is no question that the Conservative government has completely botched up the Nexen situation by completely failing to outline the concept of net benefit within the Investment Canada Act. This particular proposal goes far beyond just an ordinary investment because, in this case, we are talking about Canadian resources. Because of that failure and the lack of leadership on the part of the government, ministries within the government now are trying to make rules on the fly, it seems to me. That is unacceptable.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987009">As the motion states in (c), the government “must respect its 2010 promise to clarify in legislation the concept of 'net benefit' within the Investment Canada Act”. That is certainly not too much to ask and we all know the government has completely failed in that obligation. Yes, we know government members will rant on in their remarks about the net benefit test that is already there, but we all know that when we go through the six points, they are basically meaningless and vague, and they give government a wide-open door for what it may or may not want to do and, specifically on the Nexen-CNOOC proposal, they really are not the kind of criteria that are necessary. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987010">This is not a straightforward commercial venture in which a company is buying a business that produces widgets. This is much beyond a commercial venture. This is about buying a company that may not have the capital flow that is required to expand into the future. Yes, that company is looking for capital investment, but it is a company that has control over and access to Canadian resources that we should be looking to enhance in terms of Canada's value-added industry, Canadian jobs and resourcing our own energy sector. This is really about control of our resources.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987011">Premier Redford and a number of premiers have talked about a national energy strategy, and I certainly agree we need one. We need a national energy strategy in this country. I come from the east coast. However how do we utilize Canadian resources of all types? In this case, how do we utilize energy, which CNOOC might eventually control, to add value for Canadians, to be an energy resource for Canadians, to be a benefit to this country and to use our resources to fuel our own industrial plants where we would create Canadian jobs and production beyond our energy sector? In other words, how would we fit this proposal into a Canada-wide energy strategy?</ParaText><ParaText id="2987012">The points I just made really relate to (a) and (b) of the motion. The motion states that we need to involve all Canadians, a public process and proper public consultations, so we can see what is at stake in the overall proposal. What do Canadians really want? How will my constituents in a riding in eastern Canada, far away from where this deal is taking place, impact it?</ParaText>

The $15.1 billion effort by China's state owned oil company, CNOOC, of Canadian Nexen has to be placed in the proper context, one that goes beyond the shareholders of Nexen itself.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987014"> I will quote from testimony at a United States-China review commission on January 26, 2012. It reads:</ParaText><ParaText id="2987015"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Beijing’s instinctive impulse for national control over key resources and energy in the face of chronically growing dependence on imported oil is what has driven its push for control over overseas oil and natural gas resources embodied in its “Go Out” strategy adopted after 2000. The go out strategy reflects the growing politicization of energy security in China but is symptomatic of the reaction to growing energy security anxieties across the region in Asia among the big oil importers. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>

The NOCs often pay significant premiums to other market bidders to acquire these assets. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987018">I know that CNOOC has made clear that it is operating on a strictly commercial basis. That may be so, we do not know, but all the more reasons for proper consultations and investigation. However, it is a fact, as stated to that “before the commission”, it is paying high premiums on share prices in order to buy Nexen. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987019">If the board of directors of Nexen, who certainly need capital, are getting this premium, then they do have an obligation to their shareholders to say that it is an opportunity and that it is for shareholders.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987020">However, our job and the government's job is to decide on the criteria and on whether it would be a benefit to Canada. This motion goes right to that point.</ParaText>

This is doing the reasonable thing for Canadians and holding proper consultations in order to have the right criteria on this kind of proposal. As I said, this is not an ordinary business acquisition. This is about our energy sector. It could affect how we implement a national energy strategy, if we ever do. As it could affect jobs in our industrial plant in Canada, we need to do it correctly.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987022">The Conservative government has failed to make clear in any respect to any constituency what constitutes Canada's interest in this $15.1 billion purchase of Nexen by China's state owned enterprise, CNOOC, as demonstrated by the story in <I>The Globe and Mail</I> of September 25 headlined, “Protect Canadian ownership of oil sands firms, executives urge”.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987023">When we have public declarations from leading oil executives in Canada with respect to concerns regarding increased foreign, in this case Chinese, investment, there is a reason for greater concern, and that goes to the point of the motion.</ParaText>

I also think that Canadians understand the need to develop economic policy in this country that is capable of reflecting a multi-factored and nuanced approach. I think Canadians understand and desire economic policy in Canada that accomplishes a number of goals at the same time, where we create strong value-added industries and good, solid industrial sectors in this country that create good paying jobs on which people can raise their families. I think Canadians want the development of the Canadian economy by Canadians for Canadians and in Canadians' interests.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987040">As well, I think Canadians understand that Canada operates in the global world and that we understand and do seek to have responsible and effective investment by other countries and other companies that operate across the world in Canada. I think everybody agrees with that.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987041">Within that general framework, we have the situation of China. I think all Canadians are starting to recognize the critical importance of that country as a leading major ascending economy in the world. Right now, China has emerged as the second leading economy around the globe. China is of particular importance to western Canada, in particular to my home province of British Columbia where Asia-Pacific trade and economic relations are increasingly important every day.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987042">We know that China has massive foreign reserves. It is sitting on a lot of cash that it seeks to put to productive use around the world. Canada wants to engage and be part of this growth but Canadians do not want the growth to be completely without any kind of rules or regulations and to be pursued blindly without consideration for how that economic integration with China can be most effective in developing the Canadian economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987043"> Canadians also have a very sharp appreciation for the importance of Canada's non-renewable resource sector. We know that we are blessed with many resources that are non-renewable, from minerals to oil and gas. We know that is an important part of our economy. Canadians know that this resource is a strategic one. It is a critical domestic asset. We live in a country that is cold and we require natural gas and other substances to heat our homes, so we know that oil is a very valuable commodity. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987044">The proposed takeover of a major Canadian oil sector, in this case Nexen, by the foreign company CNOOC, a state owned Chinese company, is of major importance to Canadians. It not only raises questions of foreign ownership of Canadian strategic assets but it also raises the larger question of what Canadian policy should be toward foreign takeovers of Canadian companies generally.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987045">Therefore, the New Democrats are very pleased to have put before Parliament today a motion that reads as follows:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987046"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That, in the opinion of the House, the government: (a) should not make a decision on the proposed takeover of Nexen by CNOOC without conducting thorough public consultations; (b) should immediately undertake transparent and accessible public hearings into the issue of foreign ownership in the Canadian energy sector with particular reference to the impact of state-owned enterprises; and (c) must respect its 2010 promise to clarify in legislation the concept of “net benefit” within the Investment Canada Act.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="45">(1145)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2987047">When we read those words, I would respectfully venture to say, they are impossible to disagree with. How could anyone in Canadian Parliament, from any party, oppose a review of the takeover of major Canadian strategic oil company assets by a foreign state-owned company without having involvement and input from the public and the stakeholders of our country? </ParaText><ParaText id="2987048">Who could possibly be opposed to clarifying, not only for the Canadian public but for investors around the world, the concept of “net benefit” when that phrase is contained within the body of our legislation? Who could oppose having clearly defined criteria so that investors know what the ground rules are when we are considering a foreign takeover of a Canadian asset? It will be interesting to see whether the Conservatives oppose that. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987049">As a little background, in July 2012, CNOOC, which is a majority Chinese state-owned enterprise, made a $15.1 billion takeover bid for Nexen, which is Canada's twelfth largest oil company. This is the largest proposed foreign takeover by a state-owned enterprise in Canada's history. It is the first in a likely wave of similar major acquisitions. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987050">Nexen has 300,000 acres of oil sands assets, including an upgrader at Long Lake, as well as interests in a further 300,000 acres in shale gas assets. That is an estimated 37 trillion cubic feet of gas in northeast British Columbia. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987051">The Chinese government owns almost 65% of CNOOC and it names the chair, vice-chair and other key directorship positions, giving the Chinese state significant influence over major decision making. This deal would give state-owned CNOOC full control of a Canadian company with significant oil sands reserves, as well as offshore oil assets in the U.S., Gulf Coast and North Sea. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987052">In an attempt to win approval CNOOC has made some promises. It has promised to make Calgary the headquarters for CNOOC Ltd.'s North and Central American operations. It has promised to retain Nexen's current management and employees, to increase capital spending on Nexen's assets, to list CNOOC shares on the TSX and to maintain Nexen contributions to community and social commitments. Those are laudable promises. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987053">Here is what CNOOC has not promised. It has not promised to maintain or increase value-added processing jobs in Canada, to improve environmental performance or to place Canadian interests ahead of those of its state owners. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987054">Given the serious concerns that this deal raises, New Democrats are calling on the government not to oppose the deal at this point but to conduct open public hearings before making a decision on the deal. Both the business sector and Canadian workers in communities need certainty when it comes to foreign takeovers, but the current review process lacks transparency and accountability. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987055">The current Investment Canada Act mandates that important transactions, currently over $300 million, be reviewed. The Conservatives want to raise that threshold to $1 billion, meaning many more transactions and takeovers of Canadian companies would occur without any government review whatsoever. However, these transactions must be reviewed by the Minister of Industry to determine whether they present a net benefit to Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987056">Again, the concept of “net benefit” is not clearly defined in the act. In 2010 in the wake of the rejection of the BHP Billiton bid for Potash Corp., the then-industry minister promised to clarify the meaning of “net benefit”, but has yet to do so, notwithstanding the fact that the government has had two years to do it. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987057">In 2010, the Conservative government unanimously supported an NDP motion calling for a more transparent investment review process, including mandatory public hearings with affected communities and public disclosure of all conditions attached to approval of a takeover, along with enforceable penalties for non-compliance. The Conservatives have failed to live up to that promise as well. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987058">I also want to comment a bit about domestic investment. The current <Affiliation DbId="170685" Type="96">Minister of Trade</Affiliation> has said that it is important to attract foreign investment to Canada. Right now we have $500 billion of domestic Canadian investment sitting on the sidelines. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987059">I suggest that the government do two things: work on policies devoted to getting that Canadian domestic investment capital to work in the Canadian economy, and start keeping the promises it made in 2010 to the Canadian people to actually bring public, full, transparent review to these important economic decisions that affect all Canadians and the future of the Canadian economy.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Of course, many discussions have been held across the country with respect to the particular acquisition referred to in the motion. This interest is positive because of the importance of foreign investment to Canada. It is a good thing that more Canadians are becoming aware of it and are thinking and talking about it.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987154">As a result of our government's careful decisions prior to the worldwide economic downturn in 2008, Canada is in better shape economically than many of its peers. Despite current global economic uncertainty, we have achieved one of the best performances among the G7 countries, with almost 770,000 net new jobs created since 2009. This is the strongest job growth among the G7 countries during a global recovery.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987155">One of the reasons for Canada's economic resiliency and success over the most recent difficult few years is our government's success in attracting quality foreign investment. This government believes that Canadian companies can compete with the world's best. For that reason our government continues to welcome foreign investment that benefits Canada. The fact is that foreign investment, both from foreign companies into Canada and by Canadian companies in foreign jurisdictions, is absolutely critical to the health and wellbeing of the Canadian economy. Foreign investments can introduce new technologies and business practices that promote economic growth, increased employment and more innovation here at home, while at the same time providing Canadian business with better access to new markets and a place in the global supply chain.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987156">Our government recognizes that foreign investment can bring some of the most productive, specialized and successful firms in the world to Canada. This connection with other countries can result in some of the highest paying jobs for Canadians. Statistics Canada research has shown that foreign-owned companies operating in Canada have higher labour productivity, pay higher wages and contributed nearly 15% of total business expenditures on research and development in 2010.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987157">The government also recognizes that foreign investment provides opportunities for Canada as a player in a globalized economy, connecting Canadian firms to the rest of the world. This allows our firms to grow and compete so they can become national champions and global industry leaders. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987158">In short, foreign investment both into Canada and by Canadian firms abroad is a win-win proposition for Canadians and the economy.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987159">How well is Canada performing against other countries? We need to put all of this in context when we look at the particular legislation that has been brought into question.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987160">Since the mid-1990s, Canadians have held a larger interest in foreign operations than non-Canadians in companies operating in Canada. As of 2011, Canada has attracted $607.5 billion of foreign investment into Canada and Canadian businesses have invested $684.5 billion abroad. Therefore, Canadian businesses are doing well outside of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987161">Over the past few years Canada has attracted a significant amount of foreign investment relative to its share of global GDP and relative to other developed countries. For example, since 1980 Canada has received a greater share of the global stock of foreign investment than Australia, a comparably developed country. Indeed, Canada's stock of inward foreign investment as a percentage of our GDP has been increasing since the early 1990s. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987162">Furthermore, Canada's stock of outward foreign investment as a percent of GDP has been increasing since the late 1970s. In terms of outward foreign investment performance, Canada has consistently out-performed other peer countries since 2000, with the exception of the UK. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987163">Foreign investment in Canada comes from many sources. As of 2011, over half of the foreign investment stock in Canada came from the United States. Other key countries include the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Japan, Brazil and France. Moreover, investment from emerging markets has been increasing substantially in recent years.</ParaText>

							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2987165">Key sectors of the Canadian economy have benefited from foreign investment: first, manufacturing; second, mining, oil and gas; and third, the financial services sector. Manufacturing alone received 35% of Canada's direct foreign investment inflows, followed by mining, oil and gas at 16.4% and financial services at 15%.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987166">Canadian businesses have been leaders in investment abroad. In particular, 39% of investments by Canadian businesses in other countries have been within financial services and this share has grown in importance during the last decade. Mining, oil and gas was the second most important sector with a share of about 17% of Canadian outward foreign investment. Manufacturing was the third most important sector with a share of 14%.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987167">It is important to remember that foreign investment works both ways. Canadians benefit both from the ability of our companies to invest and operate abroad as well as from the opportunity for foreign businesses to set up shop in Canada, employing Canadians, making connections with other Canadian firms and giving consumers more choice.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987168">For Canadian businesses to expand and compete successfully throughout the world, we must continue to be open to foreign investment to demonstrate to our trading partners that we understand that protectionism is not the path to economic growth. Our government is committed to sending the message to investors around the world that Canada is a safe and stable place in which to invest and to do business. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987169">This government will continue to bring the benefits of foreign investments to Canada by providing the right economic climate so that firms in Canada will continue to prosper and create jobs for Canadians. We will also continue our work to secure access to foreign markets in order to ensure the continued success of our own Canadian businesses abroad.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987170">Let me be clear. This government knows that not all foreign investment will be of benefit to Canada. Canada is open for business, but it is not for sale. That is why we have a rigorous review process under the Investment Canada Act. The net benefit factors are clearly set out in the act and are available publicly so that investors and Canadians know what is of importance to Canada in reviewing a proposed investment. Obviously, these are broad considerations and that is a factor in the decision making.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987171">Briefly, the factors relate to the level and nature of economic activity in Canada; the degree and significance of participation by Canadians; productivity, efficiency, technological development, product innovation and variety; how it affects competition in Canada; Canada's ability to compete in world markets; and compatibility with national industrial, economic and cultural policies, including policies of provinces that are likely affected. In fact, a province that is affected by a decision has significant input. These are the factors and principles that are taken into consideration. If the minister is not satisfied that a reviewable investment is likely to be of net benefit to Canada, the Investment Canada Act allows him to block the transaction.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987172">This government is committed to protecting the security of all Canadians. The Investment Canada Act allows the government to review an investment when there is reason to believe that it could threaten or impair Canada's national security.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987173">Our record in safeguarding Canada's national security is clear. The Investment Canada Act has been around since 1985, but until this government took action, it did not contain a mechanism for safeguarding Canada's national security. Recognizing the global security context, in 2009 we put in place this particular section to ensure that Canada's national security interests will continue to be safeguarded. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987174">Our approach was in line with what other developed countries had done in a post-9/11 world. It brought Canada up to the best practices of most of our trading partners for reviewing investments on national security grounds and it did so while being consistent with our obligations and international trading agreements.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987175">Let me be clear. Protecting Canada's national security will always remain a top priority for this government. Our government has a reputation for welcoming foreign investment and will continue to do so when that investment provides a net benefit and does not impair the national security of Canadians. Those principles will guide the decision-making process.</ParaText>

Although those rules are broad, they are not difficult to understand. Anyone reading the sections would know the key considerations that go into the decision-making process.

People where I come from perhaps do not realize to what extent this could have an impact on them in the future. It is important to know what kind of precedent we want to set and how we want to improve the existing legislation. I also want to congratulate my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170651" Type="2">Burnaby—New Westminster</Affiliation> for having introduced this motion. Before I forget, I am pleased to share my speaking time with the member for <Affiliation DbId="170149" Type="2">Rivière-des-Mille-Îles</Affiliation>, one of my wonderful colleagues whom I am looking forward to hearing speak on this issue.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987189">Let us come back to the issue before us today. My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170184" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> repeatedly tried to get our colleagues opposite back on track by asking them why they could not stick to the subject. The issue before us goes beyond economic considerations. These are fundamental considerations to do with fairness and being masters in our own house. The protection of our natural resources is at stake.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987190">As several of my colleagues have said since this morning, the issue is not so much whether or not one is for or against investments, but whether these investments are responsible and beneficial to Canadians and our industries and whether they allow us to make the most of our natural resources both at home and abroad.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987191">Before continuing, I would like to speak about another extremely important issue. Our motion includes two important points. The first point concerns public hearings, and the second point, clarifying the notion of “net benefit”.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987192">I am going to start by talking about public hearings. A definition was proposed by the former minister of industry and the current president of the Treasury Board. A colleague and I saw an article published this morning where the minister was quoted. He stated that supporting our motion would mean breaking the law and that it would be illegal to hold a public consultation. He is wrong.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987193">If you do not read the legislation carefully, you could be forgiven for thinking that he is right. The Investment Canada Act places a great deal of importance on the confidentiality of information, but in paragraph 36(4)(<I>c</I>), it states that information that is already public is exempt from the confidentiality clause. Public consultations can therefore be held. After all, when it comes to the sale of Nexen, a number of facts are already in the public realm. For example, a submission that the company made to the Securities and Exchange Commission revealed that the Communist Party of China has shares in this company. There are also concerns regarding national security, which were recently raised in a public report to Parliament. These facts have already been made public. So there is no reason to consider public hearings illegal.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987194">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170651" Type="2">Burnaby—New Westminster</Affiliation> spoke this morning about the motion that our party and our late leader, Mr. Layton, had moved regarding a review of the Investment Canada Act. That particular case had to do with BHP Billiton. I was not here at the time, but all the members of the House, across party lines, unanimously supported the motion.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="40">(1240)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2987195">I will read an interesting part of that motion:</ParaText><ParaText id="2987196"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...those most directly affected by any takeover are considered, and any decision on whether a takeover delivers a “net benefit” to Canada is transparent by: (a) making public hearings a mandatory part of foreign investment review; (b) ensuring those hearings are open to all directly affected and expert witnesses they choose to call on their behalf;</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2987197">I am summarizing here because the motion is much too long. However, we can see that it talks about public hearings. This motion was unanimously adopted by the House. This is interesting, because the former industry minister said that this would be illegal. So I have a hard time understanding why he supported such a motion in 2010 but will not support the current motion, seemingly on behalf of his own government. That does not make sense. It is not too much to ask for public hearings. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987198">At the risk of repeating what has been said by many of my colleagues, this is not a matter of being for or against the purchase. It is a matter of creating a thorough process to avoid setting a precedent that could raise difficult issues or lead to problems in the future. We must also hear what Canadians have to say on this subject.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987199">That is not too much to ask. I think that is the very essence of democracy. I do not understand why the Conservative members are so afraid of holding public hearings on this. It could be a positive for them. In the future, they could refer to these public hearings once a decision has been made, since the process will have been thorough.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987200">That said, I would also like to talk about the second aspect of our motion, which deals with the definition of “net benefit”. I am not a lawyer, but any lawyer would tell you that it is important to clearly define the terms used in a bill. The government accuses us of being against entrepreneurs, business people and investment. But investors and business people are calling for a clear definition.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987201">I have spoken with business people in my riding, and they want clear regulations. They want to know whether or not they are protected. By providing a clear definition of what constitutes a net benefit, we would improve the business community's situation and create a healthier environment for investing in Canada, for both the public and shareholders.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987202">Earlier this morning, a Conservative member said that shareholders had voted in favour of the CNOOC takeover of Nexen. There are a few important points to raise in this regard. First, a public hearing does not prevent shareholders from expressing their opinions. After all, they are investors and individuals. There is nothing about this process that would prevent them from sharing their opinions and explaining to the public why they voted in favour of the takeover.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987203">As the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170651" Type="2">Burnaby—New Westminster</Affiliation> mentioned, he was the only member of Parliament at the meeting to better understand this issue. When it comes to natural resources, it is important to be, as we say in Quebec, “maîtres chez nous” or masters of our own domain. I think that all Canadians feel the same way about this. Our natural resources are an asset. It is important that everyone be involved, not just shareholders. Shareholders benefit from resources that are dear to us, that are the heart of our country's development. This is a very important issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987204">In closing, I would like to say that it was very important to me to express my opinion on this issue. In my riding, in eastern Canada and in Quebec, not everyone is aware of this issue because it primarily affects the western provinces.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987205">It is important to realize that precedents can be dangerous, problematic and worrisome. This takeover could cause harm to other sectors later. Natural resources are very important in Quebec. How do we know that this will not happen in the future under different circumstances? We must be vigilant and rigorous. That is why I am proud of our motion.</ParaText>

First, it calls on the government to undertake public consultations before making a decision concerning the plan to acquire Nexen. Second, and more broadly, it asks the government to hold consultations concerning the entire issue of foreign ownership in the Canadian energy sector. Third, the motion asks that this exercise be used to clarify the concept of “net benefit” to Canada when foreign takeovers are reviewed under the Investment Canada Act.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987230">Before going any further, I would like to do a brief review for the people listening, because I am sure there are people in my riding, Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, who are listening to me now and do not see how this issue affects their lives. But we have to remember that even though this is happening in Alberta, the issue affects all of Canada and all Canadians. This is the biggest foreign purchase offer by a government-owned company in the history of Canada and the first in what will probably be a series of similar major acquisitions.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987231"> In July 2012, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, CNOOC, put in an offer to purchase Nexen, an oil company based in Calgary, for $15 billion. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987232"> It is important to know that CNOOC is 64% owned by the Chinese government and that a number of the company's key executives, including the president and vice-president, are appointed by the Chinese government. If the transaction were to go through, as the Nexen shareholders hope, it would be the biggest takeover in Canada by a foreign state-owned corporation, and as I mentioned, some people are afraid that this is just the beginning. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987233"> By getting its hands on Nexen, the Chinese government would control the 12th largest oil company in Canada, a company that has interests in 300,000 acres of oil sands and another 300,000 acres of land that is suitable for shale gas drilling. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987234"> We have to realize that this is a growing trend. Canada has already authorized multiple acquisitions of Canadian companies by Chinese companies in the natural resources sector. According to information compiled by the CBC, these transactions add up to $23 billion dollars since 2005. Consider, in particular, the investments by the China Petrochemical Corporation in Syncrude, and various investments by the China National Petroleum Corporation in Canadian oil and gas. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987235"> To win over the Canadian regulatory authorities, CNOOC has promised to keep the company’s head office in Calgary, maintain the same number of jobs and keep the existing management team. These fine promises remind me of the commitments made by the Anglo-Australian multinational Rio Tinto when it got hold of Alcan in 2007. The brief experience we had with that transaction showed how detrimental that loss of control was for workers in Quebec. And we learned recently that the corporation was going to suspend its activities at the cathode production centre at the Arvida plant and cut management positions at the Shawinigan aluminum smelter. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987236"> We also have to realize that CNOOC's environmental practices raise eyebrows among some observers. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987237"> For example, in June 2011, two consecutive spills at CNOOC project sites dumped 204 tonnes of oil and polluted more than 6,200 km<Sup>2 </Sup>of the ocean surface in China’s Bohai Bay. The company did not report the spill until 30 days later. In addition, the site operator said that CNOOC insisted on using an affiliated company rather than going with a clean-up service that offered faster deployment.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987238"> All of this is of particular concern because the Conservative government refuses to require that corporations honour the environmental commitments made in the foreign investment review process. It is even less likely that Canada will require a state corporation that enjoys the support of the Chinese government to honour its commitments. </ParaText>

However, I want to ensure that my constituents in Burlington have an understanding of the process now, what the law is now and what the evaluation criteria are on foreign investment in Canada. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987274">I will list the six criteria and then I will talk about why they are important. The first is the effect of the investment on the level and nature of economic activity in Canada, including the effect on employment, on resource processing and on the utilization of parts, components and services produced here in Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987275">The second of the six criteria is the degree and significance of participation by Canadians in the Canadian business. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987276">The third criterion is the effect of the investment on productivity, industrial efficiency, technological development, product innovation and product variety in Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987277">The fourth factor considered in the Investment Canada Act, which the minister will review and have staff provide information on, and not just on this particular deal that seems to be today's topic but all deals by foreign entities, is the effect of the investment on competition within any industry or industries in Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987278">The fifth criterion is the compatibility of the investment with national, industrial, economic and cultural policies.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987279"> Finally, the sixth criterion is the contribution of the investment to Canada’s ability to compete in world markets.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987280">Those are all the criteria set out in legislation, easily found on the Internet and readable by everyone, including those who are investing in or wish to invest in Canada. They provide an understanding of the criteria set out in law for their decision making in terms of pursuing a Canadian company. Of course, the Investment Canada Act is important for foreign companies buying Canadian companies. There are no restrictions on Canadian companies purchasing other Canadian companies. It does not affect any industrial change that may happen when companies want to expand or change product lines within Canada. Canadian companies are more than welcome to make those investments within the country. However, we do need a regulatory framework, which we have, that allows the government and the minister of the day to look at what is good for Canada in the overall picture of a foreign purchase.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987281">I will begin with the last criterion, which is the contribution of the investment and Canada’s ability to compete in world markets, because it is important. It is the criterion the minister will consider by asking if it will make Canada more or less competitive. There is no criterion that says we want to hurt Canada's ability to compete in the world markets.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987282">When we look at any industry today, we need to ask if it will help Canada to be more productive and play a bigger role in the world marketplace. Let us face it, we are not kidding anybody. Everyone operates in a global market. Very few businesses rely on the local market, although some retail businesses do, but even in my community of Burlington, the largest employer, a pork slaughterhouse that packages materials, has 800 employees and its major customers are overseas. It sells in Canada and in North America but it is able to reach out to other parts of the world. The company happens to be owned by an American company, with some local equity and local owners involved. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="10">(1310)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2987283"> However, everybody operates in that field and we need a criterion, which we have in the Investment Canada Act. When we look at somebody else buying a Canadian company, we need to look at whether we would be better off having access to marketplaces that we might not have had access to because the Canadian company was too small, or it did not have the delivery network that often would come along with an acquisition or where another company in another part of the world have distribution networks that were not available to the Canadian company. Vice versa, if it reduces our ability as a Canadian company to access other markets or reduces our ability as Canadians to produce and sell around the world, that criterion can be used to stop an acquisition. At least it is part of the criteria.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987284">I will talk about the compatibility of the investment with national, industrial, economic and cultural policies. We have those criteria in there so if there is a purchase of a property, or a business or assets that have a cultural impact on Canada, we have the criteria by which the minister can evaluate what the impact will be on the cultural identity of Canada. If it will hurt the cultural identity of Canada, it is an opportunity for the minister of the day to say that it is not a good investment for Canada because it is against our cultural policies. It gives the government an opportunity to evaluate it. This is the kind of review that will occur on any acquisition that triggers the Investment Canada Act.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987285">Regarding the effect of the investment on competition within the industry and industries in Canada, a key component is we do not think it is a good thing for foreign investment to come into Canada and create monopolies. We on our side of the House believe in competition. We have made policies, whether through free trade or industry, through our industry committee and our industry minister, to increase competition in telecommunications. We think competition provides better products and services to individuals because they have more choice. It drives down prices normally and also drives innovation and change because the businesses want to keep up with the competition. If they do not have any competition, they do not need to change, or improve or provide customer service. However, through competition and innovation that will happen. It is a criterion of the Investment Canada Act that is presently in place, one that the current and previous ministers have used to evaluate where we go.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987286">That is only three of the six. There are six criteria of which everybody needs to be aware. Investments by foreign entities in Canada are not made without any scrutiny, as was indicated by the previous questioner that these things were not being applied. The minister will look at each one, whatever the circumstance might be, and at how it affects Canada. Those decisions will be made in the best interests of Canada in its long-term economic growth and prosperity.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Our government has engaged with Canadians and with Canadian companies to hear directly from them what is of most pressing importance. At all times, we have heard the same thing. It is the economy, employment and how to make Canada a better place for businesses to grow and succeed.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987300">Our government has focused on the economy with our economic action plan. We are ensuring that Canada's economic foundation remains strong. Despite the economic downturn of the past few years, we continue to lead the developed world. Canada is a premier destination for investment.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987301">Our government has taken the necessary steps to ensure Canada continues to attract investment that promotes economic growth, job creation and prosperity for hard-working Canadians. We recognize foreign investment creates many benefits for Canada. For example, investments often result in new technologies being adopted in Canada. We all know technology is linked to increased productivity.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987302">Our government has been a strong supporter of science, technology and research. We know these are the key building blocks of innovation. We know science powers commerce. We also know that to continue to be successful, Canada must drive product and service innovations into every corner of our economy. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987303">Foreign investment increases the amount of research and development conducted in Canada. In 2010 nearly 15% of business expenditures on research and development in Canada came from foreign investment. Therefore, foreign investment is important to Canada because it helps to support and improve our economy and, most important, create jobs for Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987304">At the same time, Canada does not exist in a vacuum. Canada must compete in a globalized economy, and that world is changing quickly.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987305">While Canada has led the developed countries since the economic downturn in 2008 due to our government's careful stewardship of the economy, new challenges are emerging. Economic powerhouses in Asia and Latin America have stepped onto the world stage and have taken up leading roles. In addition, the economic rise of Asian countries is well-known. These new emerging powers are both targets for investment and sources of investment. Canada must both compete with them to attract investment, while at the same time try to attract investment from them.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987306">The Investment Canada Act was established to encourage investment in Canada that would contribute to economic growth and provide for the review of significant investments in Canada by non-Canadians in order to ensure such benefit to Canada. The act was brought into force in 1985 to liberalize the foreign investment review regime, which had seen the precipitous drop in inward investment. The Investment Canada Act replaced the Foreign Investment Review Act, which was in place from 1973 to 1985. The Trudeau era FIRA process was not well-received and it did not do a very good job at helping Canadians attract investment. Given the foreign investment review act process, Canada's image as an attractive investment destination was in fact damaged. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987307">After 1977, there was a sharp reduction of direct foreign investment and an outflow of capital from Canada. The 1982 recession further weakened the support for the Foreign Investment Review Act. By 1983, it was clear that the act was due for major modifications.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2987308">The Investment Canada Act replaced the foreign investment review act and with that marked a shift in purpose. Recognizing the beneficial effects of increased capital and technology on the economy, the Investment Canada Act encourages investment in Canada that contributes to economic growth and employment opportunities. The act distinguishes between investments in cultural business and other investments. Since June of 1999, the Minister of Canadian Heritage has been responsible for the notification and review of investments in cultural businesses. The Minister of Industry is responsible for all other investments and for general administration of the Investment Canada Act itself. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987309">Canada's foreign investment policy has been one of continued liberalization. Our government has built on this by introducing legislation to increase the monetary threshold before reviews occur and removing some sectoral limitations. At the same time, recognizing the global security context, our government introduced guidelines for the review of investments by state-owned enterprises and rules for screening investments for national security concerns. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987310">With respect to foreign investments, our government has a sound process in place to ensure they benefit Canadians. Earlier this year, we introduced targeted amendments to the Investment Canada Act that provide greater transparency to the public, more flexibility and enforcement, and an alternative to costly and time-consuming litigation. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987311">Prior to those changes, in 2009, the government made amendments to the Investment Canada Act to provide the minister responsible flexibility to provide more information to Canadians on the review process directly. The government's focus is to make sure the Canadian economy remains competitive and productivity gains are achieved. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987312">Sound policies and a world-class climate for business are essential for making Canada a prime destination for investment. To that effect, our government sets policy priorities that reflect this view. We create programs that support strong innovation, we put in place a globally competitive industrial policy and we support an attractive business environment that promotes and rewards entrepreneurship. Just as important, we must lead by example so that Canadian businesses are welcome investors in foreign countries, allowing them to expand their operations into new markets and to compete successfully with the best in the world. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

They do not have the capacity to make a decision that is in the public interest because they do have the policies that allow them to analyze public interest.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987336">In this world today, state-owned enterprises are the norm in the energy sector across the world, whether it is Mexico, Norway, Brazil, Venezuela—in fact in most of the OPEC countries—and 75% of all oil resources are under the control of states worldwide. This is the reality of the oil and gas industry today. Only 7% of all oil and gas reserves are in countries that have a free rein on investment in oil and gas. Quite clearly, Canada is an exception, especially among energy exporting countries. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987337">I think of all the major energy exporting countries, and Canada is the only one that allows a free rein on investment. We have a situation in which Canada is not lined up with the rest of the world. We must explain why our competitive system, as we have heard the Conservatives describe it, is going to work going forward for our children and grandchildren. In terms of reserves, 13 top oil companies are state-owned. This game is afoot around the world and where is Canada? It is stuck in the mud.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987338">What is the feeling in Canada about energy? The general agreement, whether it is the premiers or the industry itself, is that we need a national energy strategy. Right across the country, there is a great deal of concern that we do not have one. This situation has been facing the Conservatives for the last six years, their time in government, and they have stonewalled on it. They have done nothing.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987339">It would be easier to support ownership of any kind if there were a Canadian agreement on the maximizing of benefits from our non-renewable and finite energy sources. These are non-renewable. These are finite. When we take them out of the country, we have less in the country, not more. So the bank account is being depleted as we speak, with our resources. What is the net benefit to Canadians from that?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987340">In the absence of a national energy strategy, how well does the laissez-faire approach work? How well is it working in the oil sands we are talking about today? One can safely say that it has been characterized by a chaotic and uncertain approach that jumps from one idea to the next. There is no control, no understanding of the environmental impacts of the oil sands. In fact, the industry itself has turned its back on the major agencies that were set up to study it and said they will not work.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987341">Take upgrading bitumen, which is a big component in the oil sands, a big part of the money and the benefits that can be made by Canadians. In 2007, the industry was prepared to upgrade all the oil in Canada. It was prepared to invest $100 billion in upgrading. How much is it ready to do today? Nothing. There is no upgrading capacity that is moving forward today in Canada, so we have lost that. Why did industry change so rapidly? What is it about our system that allows that kind of chaotic behaviour?</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="40">(1340)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2987342">There is a lack of effective research. If we look at the numbers, they show that research in the oil sands is far smaller than it is in most other aspects of the international energy scene. Why is that, when we know that the issues around the development of the oil sands are complex and become more complex the deeper we go in the ground? At a breakfast held here in Ottawa before the summer break, a professor from the University of Calgary explained very clearly what is going to happen as companies dig deeper into the oil sands and how much more difficult that is going to become.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987343">What about the direction for markets? We are proposing a pipeline to the United States to upgrade the bitumen in old refineries down there that were designed for Venezuelan heavy oil. In fact right now BP had one of its licenses turned down to operate one of those upgraders in the United States because it did not meet environmental standards. That is one idea that we have had.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987344">The other idea is to market it in China, in the far east, through the gateway pipeline, though it opposed by almost every person along that route. The idea is to export raw bitumen to China at the same time we are exporting liquefied natural gas to China. We are going to combine them there in an upgrader. How does that work for Canada?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987345">We have an industry with real problems, public relations problems in the extreme with the sale of a product that we cannot manage. Moreover, we cannot maximize the return on investments. We are squandering our resources on quick and dirty action in those oil sands. That is what is happening.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987346">How can we as Canadians make a decision today about the value of transferring the ownership of one Canadian company to a state-owned enterprise in China when we do not have a plan that we can point to for the people who are taking over the industry, saying that this is what we want them to accomplish if they come into the country, that this is how we want them to develop our country? It is not there.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987347">What about our neighbours, the United States? What do they think about this? There is bipartisan horror at the idea of turning over 1.3 million acres of Gulf of Mexico oil leases to the Chinese. Why is that? It is because the U.S. understands the nature of offshore oil. They understand that the goal in their country is to develop the resources so that they are energy independent. They know that very well. That is why they are standing up. They are standing up for the interests of the United States.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987348">Two weeks ago I brought up the matter of the leases in the Arctic. We just gave up a lease in the Arctic of over 900,000 square hectares to a company with almost no assets, a company that we knew was going to turn around and sell it to someone else, maybe the Russians, the Koreans, or the Chinese, who have icebreakers and deep sea drilling capacity.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987349"> Does our minister even have the power to say no to a transfer? No, he does not under the Canada Petroleum Resources Act that governs northern petroleum development. He does not have the ability to say no to a transfer.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987350">Right across this country, we are failing our children and our grandchildren with our laissez-faire approach to an industry and energy source that countries right around the world are standing up for themselves and taking advantage of us for. That is what is happening right around the world.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987351">Where is Canada? It is without a strategy, without a direction, flailing in the wind. That is a terrible thing to have to say in this Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987352">Here we have a chance to change it. If the Conservatives get onside and start holding public hearings on these issues that are so important to us, that can make the difference. Stand up for Canada.

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Martin" id="7700899"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170429" Type="2">Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2987368">Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this opportunity to enter this debate on the NDP's opposition day motion. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987369">We should say at the outset, in case people are just tuning in now, that the terms of this motion are simply to insist on public consultation to examine in a fulsome way the takeover deal of Nexen. This is not a debate about whether we should or should not allow the deal to go through. I have my own personal views on that, but we should be clear that we are calling for the inclusion of the public and a full examination and full due diligence of this takeover deal. That is all this debate is about.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987370">If there is one thing we want to make clear in the context of this debate, it is that Canada is open for business but that Canada is not for sale. That must be driven home. Believe me, if there were a full and true examination and consultation, the Conservative Party would have a heck of a job convincing Canadians that it is in their best interest to have a foreign nation state buy our birthright from under our feet and pay cash on the barrelhead for our future in the energy field.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987371">The Chinese are on a global acquisition frenzy. That is not overstating things. It is predicted that over a trillion dollars will be disgorged from China to acquire natural resources, pulp and paper mills, and whatever energy and resources they possibly can.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987372">Believe me, it is the high profile companies like the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, CNOOC, that are interested in buying Nexen. However, it is simply one of hundreds of Chinese corporate arms of China Inc. The audacity of China Inc. in this global acquisition frenzy is astounding. Other ones include Sinopec, Chinmetals, PetroChina, the China Investment Corporation, and thousands more unknown Chinese corporations owned by lower levels of the Chinese government, which are beginning to venture abroad, gobbling up assets.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987373">We would be naive, irresponsible and crazy not to examine this motion in a full, comprehensive way and put in place guidelines and rules to respond to this global acquisition frenzy.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987374">We are blessed in this country with an abundance of natural resources. It is our children's future, and how it is managed and developed is critical. Therefore, it is not audacious on the part of the NDP to be calling upon the government to open the door to a public debate and consultation. Let us hear from the best minds in the country, for and against this idea. Let us put it all out there and have a national conversation on whether we do or do not approve of this particular takeover.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987375">We have to keep in mind that this is not any ordinary foreign takeover. Here I would point out as an aside the contradiction in the Conservative Party's speaking points today. I am the critic for the Canadian Wheat Board, and the prairie members of the Conservative caucus were insistent that the Canadian Wheat Board had to be abolished because we could not have that kind of communism on the prairies in our grain marketing. That is the word they used. Behind closed doors, the Conservative prairie members referred to the Canadian Wheat Board as communism. A bunch of prairie farmers, banding together to act in their own best interests to get the best price for their grain was communism and it had to stop.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987376">Yet the conservatives see no problem with selling our birthright in the Canadian oil sands to true communists, in fact communists with a terrible human rights record. If the Conservatives cannot see a ridiculous contradictions in their own talking points on that, then they are even thicker than I thought.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987377">Petro-Canada had to be sold because it smacked of socialism. Even if we had the temerity to keep some control over a tiny portion of the oil industry so that we would at least know if we are being gouged by big oil, no, that had to go because it smacked of socialism if the nation state of Canada actually owned a piece of the oil industry below its feet. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987378">Yet the Conservatives speakers I have heard today apparently see no problem with China Inc. gobbling up our children's birthright in the oil sands. I am against the deal, but I am only one voice. We should be consulting all Canadians. There should be a referendum on this kind of question. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="55">(1355)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2987379">The Conservatives laugh but they will not be laughing for long. They are talking about putting limits on foreign ownership by state owned enterprises. What is to stop 20% being owned by CNOOC and another 20% being owned by one of China Inc.'s other hundreds and hundreds of subsidiaries? These are not democratically elected boards of directors. They are appointed by dictatorships to act in their own best interests. I wish them good luck in trying to instill the best interests of Canadians into the board of directors of a Communist Chinese company. I do not know how they can live with the glaring contradiction in their own arguments and talking points. It drives me crazy. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987380">We have lost virtually all of our manufacturing jobs to China. I used to have 43 garment manufacturers in my riding. I have only been an MP for 15 years. When I was first elected, there were 43 garment manufacturers in my riding and some of them had 1,500 employees. It was a huge burgeoning industry. Do members know how many there are left? There are three and only one of them actually produces any clothing. The rest of the work is now in China. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987381">We comforted ourselves by saying that our kids will not want to work in those industries anyway, so we will let the Chinese have the garment industry. We have natural resources that we will develop and our high tech industry. However, guess what? China also learned high tech pretty good and has those jobs too. What does that leave us with? It leave us with the oil patch, our natural resources. Now we are going to let the nation state of China come in and buy up our natural resources as well? I call it economic treason.

This includes a business plan for the Canadian company.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987684">Foreign investments are reviewable if the assets of the Canadian company are equal to or greater than a threshold established in the act. The threshold for World Trade Organization member countries is adjusted each year by an amount equivalent to the change in the gross domestic product of the investor’s home country. In 2012, this threshold is $330 million. The threshold for cultural businesses and non-WTO countries remains at the levels established in 1985: $5 million for direct acquisitions and $50 for indirect acquisitions. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987685">Under the act, the Minister of Industry has an initial period of 45 days to consider the proposed investment and decide whether it will have a net benefit.

Divulging confidential information outside the narrow exceptions of the act is a criminal infraction. During the review process, investors generally provide plans and undertakings to support their view that their investments are likely to be of net benefit to Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987738">The act sets out strong protections for the information obtained from an investor or Canadian business.

Monitoring may be more frequent. Additional evaluations may be performed based upon the performance of the investor and the duration of the undertakings.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987741">The act provides for remedies where the minister is not satisfied that the investor is meeting its obligations under the act.</ParaText>

Decisions to take enforcement measures are made on a case-by-case basis based upon the specific circumstances of the transaction. The process for enforcing plans and undertakings provided by an investor during the review process includes seeking an order from a superior court to remedy any gap in implementation of plans or undertakings.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987743">Our government has also been proactive in updating the act to adapt to the changing environment. In particular, our government introduced the state owned enterprise guidelines in 2007; introduced a national security amendment in 2009; amended the act to raise the review threshold, focusing reviews on the transactions that are most significant to the Canadian economy; introduced targeted changes to provide the minister with a greater ability to publicly communicate information on the review process; and published an annual report on the administration of the act.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987744">The climate for international investment is constantly evolving.

When we consider a case like the acquisition of Nexen by CNOOC, the Conservatives’ penchant for secrecy and control without accountability shows in everything they do. Canadians are losing confidence in our investments because we are not in a position to determine whether an acquisition is in their best interests.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987761"> The opposition motion debated in the House today is not necessarily asking for the acquisition of Nexen by CNOOC to be rejected without an appraisal of the situation. It is basically asking that the process leading to a decision be sound. This debate is about transparency and accountability.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987762"> It is essential to hold consultations and to clarify the net benefit review process to ensure that the interests of Canadians are truly protected. When the net benefit criteria are not clear, the decision becomes arbitrary. There is neither transparency nor accountability. Even investors are not reassured by this arbitrary process. Until the act is clarified, it is impossible to weigh Canada’s interest against foreign interests.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987763"> In 2010, even the Conservatives agreed that the “net benefit” concept should be defined more clearly in the act. The then minister of industry had promised to do so. As we in the House know, the Conservatives do not come through on their promises of transparency. This is not surprising to us. Without this essential clarification, the net benefit is at the mercy of the minister’s own definition. I sincerely believe that this definition is not one that Canadians would accept.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987764"> In 2007, the guidelines added by the Conservatives to the act specified among other things that the targeted corporations should pay attention to what senior officials have to say, appoint Canadians to the board of directors and list the corporation’s shares on a Canadian stock exchange. I am not about to disagree that these factors should be taken into account, but the true concerns of Canadians relate more to employment and the environment. As it happens, environmental concerns are missing from the process, and employment is given short shrift.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987765"> In the specific case of Nexen, CNOOC has not promised to keep value-added jobs in Canada or to create new jobs. Nor has it promised anything about improving environmental performance.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987766">With regard to the environment, it is not just the lack of promises that is disturbing. The different trade agreements that the Conservatives negotiated without paying attention to the details could prevent us from effectively protecting the environment because they would make the Canadian government open to legal action by foreign companies if it legislates in a responsible manner.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987767">Furthermore, there is a significant risk for our jobs, especially in the processing and refining sectors. Are the Chinese not interested in extracting oil here and refining it in China? I believe that would be in their best interest. In that case, high-quality jobs in Canada's processing sector will be lost. China's refining capacity is at 85%. There are no guarantees that China will not use Canadian crude for the remaining 15%. That is hardly a net benefit.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987768">While the Conservatives' priority is to find out who will be on the board of directors, jobs and the environment are the priorities of Canadians and the NDP. We must also not forget national security, which has been discussed a great deal recently, and security of intellectual property. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2987769">The Canadian Security Intelligence Service, CSIS, issued a warning in its most recent report:</ParaText><ParaText id="2987770"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">When foreign companies with ties to foreign intelligence agencies or hostile governments seek to acquire control over strategic sectors of the Canadian economy, it can represent a threat to Canadian security interests. The foreign entities might well exploit that control in an effort to facilitate illegal transfers of technology or to engage in other espionage and other foreign interference activities.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2987771">The People's Republic of China has a 64.45% stake in CNOOC and has a ministry of political and ideological affairs. In addition, China also has a party committee in the company. Better yet, the company president considers deepwater oil rigs to be its mobile national territory and a strategic weapon. All this seems to be consistent with the warnings that the Conservatives seem to be ignoring.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987772">We must also consider that this acquisition is probably not an isolated event. China is making massive investments in natural resources abroad, which could have disastrous consequences. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987773">For example, take China's investments in and purchases of agricultural land in Africa. The strategy is obvious: guarantee food security for China, which in turn weakens Africa's food security. It is vital that we prevent this type of phenomenon from taking place in Canada.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987774"> After making a few strategic purchases, China or any other foreign power could rapidly gain significant control of our natural resources. There is a definite risk that a precedent will be set. We are talking about the nationalization of our natural resources for the benefit of another nation. I believe this is a mistake.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987775"> The Conservatives will of course answer that investments in the economy are necessary, and on that we agree. Certainly, such investments help our economy. But while they want to have investments that are controlled outside Canada, I think the best way of promoting innovation and developing the Canadian economy is really to have Canadian investments.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987776"> In an article published in <I>Canada Business </I>entitled “Canadian business must invest more if Canada is to remain competitive”, journalist Hugh McKenna quoted a report prepared by Deloitte, “<I>The Future of Productivity: Clear choices for a competitive Canada</I>”. I took two points from that article that are being completely ignored by the Conservatives: first, the real problem with Canadian productivity is the lack of investment and capacity for expansion on the part of Canadian companies; second, the government should make the foreign investment review process more transparent.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987777"> Those positions reflect the concerns felt by Canadians. Unfortunately, the Conservatives do not seem to have the same concerns about real prosperity, jobs, the environment and the security of Canada.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987778"> They are even working against those principles by raising the threshold in the act for a transaction that is subject to the net benefit review. At present, the Investment Canada Act provides that transactions with a value of $330 million or over are to be reviewed by the Minister of Industry, but that threshold will shortly be raised to $1 billion or over. The government is clearly moving backwards when it comes to standing up for Canadian interests.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987779"> To conclude, I have to point out the perfect ironic illustration of how less than zealous the Conservatives are when it comes to standing up for Canadian interests. Although the Conservatives seem set on approving the Nexen purchase with no discussion, the acquisition of the agricultural corporation Viterra by Glencore, which the Conservatives had approved, is currently being subjected to careful scrutiny by China’s anti-monopoly agency. I find that interesting.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987780"> I repeat: as a general rule, in this debate, we should not be replacing one arbitrary approach with another.</ParaText>

Specifically, the motion calls on the government to delay making a decision on the proposed Nexen takeover by Chinese state-owned firm CNOOC until such a time as full public consultations are conducted. It also calls on the government to initiate a broader consultation process on the issue of foreign ownership in the Canadian energy sector, with particular reference to the impact of state-owned enterprises. Finally, it calls on the government to respect its 2010 promise to clarify in legislation the concept of net benefit within the Investment Canada Act.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987791">The clock is ticking, and the Conservative government stubbornly continues to study Nexen's takeover behind closed doors. Since July, New Democrats have repeatedly called for public hearings to study the ins and outs of this important transaction that would allow foreign interests to take over a portion of our oil sands, in a way that is transparent. But the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his inner circle have ignored our requests. We are now into the final stretch, and with this motion New Democrats will try once again to make the government listen to reason as well as the concerns of many citizens, experts and businesspeople.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987792">We all know that Canada was built for trade and that foreign investment can play a positive role in building and strengthening our economy, if done right. Yet the Conservative track record on foreign investment demonstrates a lack of foresight, and the experience in my community of Sudbury is but one example of why the Investment Canada Act needs to be updated and, further, why full public consultations for major foreign takeovers are necessary to ensure Canada is taking the proper approach to foreign investment.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987793">In the fall of 2010, this House unanimously backed an NDP motion calling for the modernization of the Investment Canada Act and specifically a clear definition of what constitutes a net benefit under the act. Further, the Minister of Industry at the time also made a commitment, both in the House and in various media outlets to bring “clarity” to the act in order to ensure that Canada's foreign investment procedures were clear for investors, for workers and for the Canadian public. Yet unsurprisingly, the Conservatives have reneged on this commitment to review and clarify the Investment Canada Act, leaving both investors and everyday Canadians in the dark.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987794">It was my hope that this issue would have come before the industry committee, of which I am a member following the 31st general election. However, as yet, despite the government's commitment to re-examine the act, the committee has not had the opportunity to undertake a study into the deficiencies of the act. The public can take that as it may, as it has not been the New Democrats who have been stalling on this front.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987795">One of the most troublesome aspects of the Investment Canada Act as it currently stands is the lack of a requirement for full public consultations for large foreign takeovers like the proposed Nexen deal. Put simply, without amendments to the Investment Canada Act, Canada's foreign investment regime will continue to lack transparency and accountability. That is why New Democrats are calling for transparent public hearings on the proposed takeover before any decision is taken on whether or not to approve this deal.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987796">Like many Canadians, New Democrats have concerns about the risky hands-off approach of the government and its refusal to conduct an open and transparent review of this proposed takeover. The business sector, Canadian workers and communities need certainty when it comes to foreign takeovers, but the current review process lacks transparency and accountability. While the Conservatives have refused to hold public hearings on the CNOOC Nexen takeover, they have been busy meeting with well-connected lobbyists on the matter, including former advisers to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="00">(1600)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2987797">This speaks volumes about the approach taken by the government. Insiders continue to get intimate details of government plans while ordinary Canadians are left out in the cold. This is a story that has become all too common with the Conservative government. The fallout in Sudbury resulting from foreign takeovers of Inco by Vale and Falconbridge by Xstrata has made it clear to me that holding public consultations and ensuring the public disclosure of associated undertakings is necessary to ensure an open, transparent and accountable process for reviewing foreign takeover proposals, such as the one we have in front of us with Nexen.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987798">Canadians deserve better. We need public hearings to provide clear answers to the serious questions raised by this deal and the various others coming down the pike.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987799">A second major deficiency of this act as it stands and one that we had a firm commitment from the former Minister of Industry to correct is the highly subjective net benefit test. Specifically, the concept of net benefit is not clearly defined by the act, creating uncertainty for investors and for potentially affected communities. Therefore New Democrats are once again calling for long overdue changes to the act to clarify the criteria used to evaluate net benefit.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987800">If it seems like New Democrats are yelling from the rooftops on this issue, it is because we have been the only party to consistently call for a cleanup of this act. Once again, the inherently problematic net benefit test is rearing its ugly head.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987801">It is not just New Democrats clamouring for a cleanup of this section of the act, rather Canada's business leaders are also echoing this call. For instance, the president of Winnipeg-based steel fabricator Empire Industries Ltd. has described the current system as “highly subjective” and has stated that it is important to have clear ground rules.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987802">However, because the PMO and the <Affiliation DbId="170695" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation> have continued to hide behind a cloak of secrecy in relation to this proposed takeover and have been sitting on their hands for the best part of two years in terms of bringing forward a more objective test than the net benefit, neither industry nor investors nor the Canadian public have any idea of what criteria this proposal must meet in order to be approved.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987803">Unfortunately, as the representative for Sudbury, it is déjà vu all over again for me. Canadians need answers on their key questions and concerns to verify that this deal would be a net benefit to Canada. Unfortunately, the Conservatives have thus far only spit out repetitive talking points in place of the substantive information that Canadians are seeking.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987804">Another instructive statement comes from Scott Hand, the CEO of Inco until it was acquired in 2006 by Vale, who has argued that the net benefit clause and specifically Canada's unwillingness to shield strategic industries despite other countries judicious exercise of this right, makes Canada a boy scout playing among other countries who play hard ball.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987805">This speaks to the specific issue of allowing foreign state-owned enterprises to buy up what could only be described as a strategic resource. In 2006, when CNOOC attempted to purchase American-owned Unocal, a fulsome debate on the issue of both strategic resources and national security was allowed to take place. Ultimately, this bid was rejected by the U.S. government as allowing a foreign state-owned enterprise to take over a strategic industrial entity like Unocal was deemed to be against the national interest. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987806">The notion of selling a strategic resource like Nexen to a foreign state-owned entity has also been strongly refuted by one of the people responsible for crafting the Investment Canada Act. Mr. Sinclair Stevens, an industry minister under the Mulroney government, who brought in the Investment Canada Act to replace the more stringent Foreign Investment Review Act, has stated:</ParaText><ParaText id="2987807"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">While we didn’t put it in the act, the departmental view was very firm: you can’t tolerate state-owned firms taking over anything in any substantial way in Canada....</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987808">I know my time is coming to an end, but it is time to open up this issue for broader discussion.

First, it calls for public consultations on a specific deal, the Nexen-CNOOC deal, which is under negotiation. Second, it calls for public hearings into foreign ownership in the Canadian energy sector at large. Third, it calls on Canada and the government to clarify the net benefit test in the Investment Canada Act before a decision is made with respect to this specific transaction.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987823">For the record, the Liberal Party will be supporting this motion, but let us just step back for a few minutes and look at how we got to where we are today.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987824">This proposed acquisition has been in the works for a long time. It follows hard on the heels of the proposed potash deal, which raised so many similar concerns and issues. Both Nexen and CNOOC, as parties to this proposed deal, played by the existing rules, even though they knew that changes to the definition of net benefit under the Investment Canada Act were supposedly forthcoming.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987825">In fact, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> stood in his place with a number of front-line cabinet ministers two years ago and promised that a major review of what constituted a net benefit to Canada would be undertaken. It was never done, even in the full knowledge that this and other deals were in full negotiation.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987826">My colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170113" Type="2">Halifax West</Affiliation>, our Liberal industry critic, brought a motion to the industry committee almost nine months ago. Let me read it. It is simple and it is direct. He proposed that the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology undertake a study of the Investment Canada Act and present a report to the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987827">It turns out the committee rightly decided to pursue the study, but we do not really know what was said. Once again, the deliberations were held in camera, behind closed doors. This is a neat little trick pulled by the Conservatives across all committees to censor access to information on a very regular basis.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987828">Since then, nothing. Did the government recall the committee over the summer months to take a crack at the study? No. Did it produce a comparative study of what other countries who have tackled these issues have done? No. Did it identify and make public the salient questions to be addressed beyond the six factors to be taken into account under section 20 of the Investment Canada Act? Absolutely not; so here we are. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987829">Shareholders and the boards of directors of both companies involved have approved the deal. They believe their interests are best served. That is fine. That is as it should be in the free market. However, what we are talking about is Canadian interests, not shareholder interests exclusively.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987830">It is at once the irresponsibility and the incompetence of the Conservative regime that has led us to this point. It is irresponsible and incompetent in the fact that the net benefit test has not been dealt with. It is irresponsible and incompetent in the fact that it has been dispatching the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and ministers all over the world to drum up investments from countries such as China in full knowledge that proposed deals like the Nexen one, or any of the several other deals now being worked on in the oil patch, would be highly controversial. It is irresponsible and incompetent in its refusal to answer the questions that Liberals have raised for weeks, either because the Conservatives are afraid to admit they do not have the answers or they are afraid to tell Canadians the truth.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987831">The truth is that Canadians do not have confidence that our interests are being addressed and protected. They have serious concerns and are eager to learn more about this specific deal, its ramifications and its long-term effects on one of our most important natural resource sectors.</ParaText>

Because of its inaction, Canada is now facing a wave of foreign takeovers and the rules have not been clarified. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987833"> We understand that it is necessary for the government to retain some flexibility to exercise its discretion, since no two deals are identical, but we also believe that foreign takeovers must be done transparently and that Canadians must be informed about the guarantees involved and the reasons a transaction is deemed a net benefit to Canadians. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987834"> Let us be very clear: the Liberals are in favour of foreign investment but, since 2006—and especially since 2010—we have been calling for more transparency in foreign takeovers. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987835"> The government is not able to provide this transparency and not able to dispel the impression that the process is based on purely political considerations.

Very important questions loom large and need to be answered in order for Canadians to understand what guarantees might be given and why a transaction is deemed of net benefit to Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987837">First, because we have no national energy strategy in this country, as called for by Alberta's premier and by our party for over six years, where does this and other transactions fit into our energy future? Where does it fit into our climate future?</ParaText><ParaText id="2987838">There is no doubt that case after case with respect to our approach to energy will continue to surface, from Keystone to the northern gateway pipeline, another Conservative fiasco according to Jim Prentice, and now this Nexen deal. The Conservatives are lurching from crisis to crisis instead of defining a national energy strategy that includes changing the Investment Canada Act.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987839">I will take a moment to answer the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s question when he responded to Premier Redford by saying that when it came to a national energy strategy he had “no idea what she was talking about”. I will enlighten the Prime Minister and let him know what we are talking about.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987840">This is about building on the early and tentative work by provincial and federal ministers in full respect of provincial jurisdiction. It would encompass the following key elements: regulatory reform; energy efficiency; energy information; markets; international trade; smart grid technology; reliability of our electricity system; building codes; building standards; and transportation efficiency. </ParaText><ParaText id="2987841">Furthermore, we should be conducting a full and transparent analysis of federal and provincial programs and fiscal incentives and disincentives applicable specifically to the energy sector in all of its forms: fossil fuels, wind, solar, geothermal, biofuels and nuclear, with a view to facilitating Canada's transition to a low carbon future. That is what the race is all about in the global marketplace.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987842">However, more questions need to be raised. In the energy sector, what should the maximum ownership limits be set at, 49% or no limits? If a company commits to keeping its head office in Canada, what if it does not? Similarly, CNOOC is committing to keep all 3,000 Nexen jobs and its current management team. What if it does not? How are these commitments enforceable? When shall we demand that Canadians be on the board of directors and how many? What about Canadians on the boards of the foreign companies that are targeting Canadian companies?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987843">When we hear about the national security interests raised recently by CSIS, when do these trump a potential deal? What exactly are national security interests? Are they related to information technology? Are they related to trade secrets? Are they related to intellectual property and patents? These things need to be better defined.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987844">How do we treat state owned enterprises versus privately held or publicly traded companies? Should we be factoring in human rights considerations in the country from whence the acquiring company is coming?</ParaText><ParaText id="2987845">What if Canadians have invested in a Canadian enterprise through government support? This might be from direct financial support in the form of programming assistance or it might be fiscal assistance in, for example, the writing off of assets over a shorter period of time but that is an investment made by the Canadian taxpayer in a Canadian company. However, if a company has been supported by Canadian taxpayers in one of these two forms, how should we see that investment in terms of the Canadian people? Should the Canadian taxpayers be indemnified? Should we be asking that Canadian taxpayers get some of their money back?</ParaText><ParaText id="2987846">Another question that this transaction raises, which ought to have been addressed in committee months if not years ago by the government working with all parties, is whether foreign ownership limits by companies or sectors be brought in. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987847">Some estimates show that today in Canada two-thirds of oil sands production is already owned by foreign companies based on shareholders. Should that be a factor? Should that be allowed to continue? Is two-thirds too high, just right or too low? None of this has been subjected to what I would call the light of evidence and analysis in a good working place like, for example, the industry committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987848">Another important question that Canadians are asking about this transaction is whether can Canadians invest in the country where the buyer comes from? If not, what should we be looking to ask for? What should we be looking to leverage from that country? For example, some have said in this case that Canada ought to be demanding better access to the financial services sector so that Canadian banks, for example, can expand their operations in what is clearly a huge market.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987849">I have another question. Will there be full compliance with Canadian labour and environmental laws? What conditions should be met with respect to enhancing community and social commitments?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2987850">It is clear that the issue of enforceability weaves its way through each and every one of those questions. Those questions are fundamental to our jobs, innovation, technologies, patents and intellectual property. They are fundamental to the deployment of Canadian capital, to growing and maintaining our expertise in our trades, in our management and, yes, even in our ownership. Those questions are also fundamental to whether Canada's companies will compete in global markets. However, all those questions have not seen the light of day despite the promise made by the government.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987851"> Now we find ourselves in a situation where Canada is being squeezed. Actually, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his ministers are being squeezed because they have gone all over the world telling people that we are open for business. They have said, “come one, come all, everything is for sale at the highest price”. However, we now face a situation where it is going into the secrecy of cabinet, where the net benefit test is not working as it is presently construed under the act, and we are in a situation now where Canada is vulnerable.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987852"> I would suggest that all parties come together in the industry committee, support my colleague's motion for a major study on this question and come back with enlightened information for all parliamentarians to learn from so that we can set the right net benefit test for Canadians going forward.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The government has been avoiding a definition of what it means by “net benefit” for two years now. Now, we have the opportunity to rectify the problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987918"> The government ought not to come to a decision on the $15.1 billion acquisition proposal submitted by CNOOC without consulting the public. The current decision-making process is not transparent enough and it is open to political pressure.

I would argue, however, that it is the ambiguity of the “net benefit” concept and this government’s inaction that have caused investor uncertainty to increase. Open and transparent debate would provide investors with the confidence they need. Once the term “net benefit” to Canada is properly defined, investors will know how to proceed. They will know where they can invest.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987920"> Today, investors and Canadians alike are in the dark. Open and transparent debate is a key pillar of democracy. Debate and the right to freedom of expression are essential values in our political system.</ParaText>

Is the government afraid of hearing what Canadians have to say? Does the government believe that Canadians do not share its foreign investment priorities? Whether we are talking about the Northern Gateway oil pipeline or the drastic changes made in the last budget, Bill <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document>, this government does not appear to want to consult the people in any way. This is probably because they know that Canadians will oppose the Conservatives' plans.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987922"> And yet, a responsible and democratic government cannot refuse to consult simply because it is afraid of what the people might say. Public consultation is a two-way relationship in which Canadians give information to the Canadian government. Public consultation is an essential component of our democratic system. It is a tool for expressing our fundamental rights. A democratic and open government must actively and genuinely engage the people in decision-making processes. Canadians want to be better informed. They want to be consulted and in particular, they want to play a role in processes that affect the country’s economy and their quality of life.</ParaText>

It should mean cheaper energy costs.</ParaText><ParaText id="2987932">The facts have not changed. Exports of unrefined bitumen are increasing. This is a valuable, finite resource and it will be processed in other places, such as China or the United States.

However, they decided that was more important to study, as we approached a potential election, than the Investment Canada Act at the time.

							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="2988023">I do not believe that a single one of us present in the House today would disagree with any of the words I have just quoted from the bill's preamble. Many of us are parents of children and whether a parent or not, all of us want the best for our Canadian children and indeed for every child on this planet. All of us recognize intrinsically that children enter this world completely helpless and that it is the responsibility, not only of parents but also of the nation, to ensure that we attend to their needs, including their health, safety, material security, education and socialization, as well as their sense of being loved, valued and included in the families and societies in which they are born.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988024">While all of us are torn by the heart-wrenching sight of a malnourished child in the Sahel region of Africa, or by the sight of children begging for food in the street rather than attending school, or indeed by the sight of young children working in atrocious conditions in a factory or a mine, we take comfort in the thought that in Canada we have taken measures to prevent this kind of thing from happening.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2988025">Yet we know that all is not perfect within our own country and that children's rights are also not always protected or taken into consideration. While successive Conservative and Liberal governments have brought in measures that were clearly focused on our children and young people, and this is commendable, we also know that we must continue to be extremely vigilant when it comes to our children and their basic rights.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2988026">Parents obviously have a fundamental responsibility for their children, but so does the state. It is the state that makes the laws of the country that affect all of us, including our children and what happens to them. It is the state that provides the infrastructure of schools for education and hospitals for health care, as well as many other institutions that touch the lives of our children. It is the state that decides what minimum social safety net we will put in place to ensure that nobody falls between the cracks through no fault of their own.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988027">We have all recoiled with horror at what we, as a country, did to our aboriginal children by transferring them into the residential school system. We are all disgusted when we hear the stories of sexual abuse of children by adults in many schools, horrific stories that have been coming to the surface in the past few decades. How could this happen in Canada?</ParaText><ParaText id="2988028">While these are dramatic examples of what can happen to our defenceless children, we also know that child poverty is a reality in our country, that children go to school hungry, that they sometimes go to bed hungry, that they sometimes live in poor housing conditions, that they are not provided with the adequate educational resources that they need, that they suffer from mental health problems and that they are exposed to bullying and so on.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2988029">Let me say this loud and clear. I am not standing here today pointing the finger at any party, any organization or any person. We all bear collective responsibility for the well-being of our children. Just as we can be proud of some of the measures that we have implemented to ensure their well-being, we must also concede that no party has a perfect record and that much work still has to be done.</ParaText>

We all know that some children go to school without having eaten a nutritious breakfast. These examples are striking, but they are not our only concerns as federal legislators.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988031">For example, when a couple divorces and the family includes children, federal family law determines the fate of those children to some extent. This legislation obviously must take into consideration the well-being of these children. When a young offender commits a very serious crime and he is under 18, the justice system treats him differently than it would an adult and for good reason. Again, federal legislation could determine what will happen. In all of this there is, of course, the matter of federal or provincial jurisdictions.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988032">Today I am speaking in favour of creating a federal office of the commissioner for children and young persons, recognizing at the same time that there are organizations at the provincial level that have responsibilities toward children. One might wonder whether it is necessary to have a federal commissioner when the provinces have equivalent positions. The answer is yes. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2988033">First of all, these provincial equivalents—let us call them children's ombudsmen or advocates—agree that it is important to have a federal commissioner so that there is a federal-provincial exchange that will make it possible to initiate a national dialogue on children and to identify existing gaps. The provincial and federal jurisdictions do not meet all of the needs of our children. Our children have needs that fall through the cracks between the federal and provincial jurisdictions.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988034">A motion to eliminate child poverty by 2000 was adopted in the House 23 years ago by all the parties. We made this promise for good reasons, but we did not keep it. The other priorities of the day distracted us from our goal and, with time, the promise was lost among those other priorities.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2988035">Child poverty still exists today. The rate of child poverty is approximately 13% and, if I were to ask my colleagues whether we should give priority to reducing that rate—a rate that is much too high in a country like Canada—I am sure that they would all say yes. But things have a tendency to be forgotten with time when other crises arise. That is why we need a commissioner for children and young persons who would report to Parliament and Canadians on a yearly basis.</ParaText>

A commissioner would be there to remind us because every one of us needs to be reminded from time to time that we have work to do here or there with respect to the obligations that we undertook toward our children and young people and, yes, a commissioner would also tell us when we are doing a good job at satisfying those obligations.</ParaText>

We need to ensure that they grow up healthy, in safe conditions, with a good education and within a well-balanced social environment. We need to provide the less fortunate ones with extra help to ensure they are also able to achieve their potential. When children's needs are not addressed, whether it be their nutrition, living conditions, health needs and so on, we end up with more children who get in trouble with the law, suffer mental problems or cannot maintain long-term jobs.</ParaText>

Some of the key responsibilities envisaged for such a commissioner include: to review, monitor and report to Parliament annually on Canada's implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child; to conduct an impact assessment on all federal legislation, regulations and other instruments related to the rights of children and young persons; to carry out special duties or inquiries when requested by Parliament or committee or the Minister of Justice; and to raise public awareness of the convention.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988060">I have reviewed Bill <Document DbId="5514117" Type="4">C-420</Document> and after careful consideration it appears to me that the proposed creation of a federal children's commissioner would, arguably, be redundant.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988061"> Here is why I will be voting against Bill <Document DbId="5514117" Type="4">C-420</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988062">The establishment of a federal children's commissioner as proposed by this bill would be a costly and unnecessary duplication of existing international and domestic reporting and implementation mechanisms. Further, it could indirectly impact upon provincial and territorial areas of responsibility.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="2988063">Mr. Speaker, creating and maintaining an office for the federal commissioner for children will increase the tax burden on Canadian taxpayers. In fact, the net annual cost of comparable arm's-length commissioners' offices totalled approximately $7 million, dollars that are not, in my opinion, well spent on a new bureaucratic entity. The creation of an office of the commissioner for children and young persons will add an administrative level at the expense of accountability and oversight.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988064">We take the implementation of Canada's international obligations in the area of human rights very seriously. Canada already reports to the United Nations every five years regarding the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Canada also deals with issues affecting children in the reports it presents as part of a multitude of international treaties in the area of human rights, including The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women and the International Convention on The Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="2988065">Many of the functions of the proposed federal children's commissioner are being performed through existing domestic mechanisms. For instance, the government already promotes public awareness of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, reviews proposed legislation and regulations for consistency with human rights protections, and promotes ongoing implementation of the convention through the provision of legal advice and training. Moreover, parliamentary bodies have conducted and continue to conduct special studies on children's issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988066">Effective domestic coordination is already in place through various interdepartmental and intergovernmental mechanisms.

Around 1990, I was the chair of the poverty 2000 campaign in Hamilton when it first started and, sadly, we did not reach the goal we were looking at. In many ways, things are much worse than they once were.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988074">Members will be aware that in 1991 Canada ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The convention, among other things, charges the current government with the responsibility of taking all available measures to make sure that children's rights are respected, protected and fulfilled. We heard in the parliamentary secretary's speech reference made to the government's belief that this is taking place today, though we have some disagreement about that. </ParaText><ParaText id="2988075">When countries ratify such agreements, they agree to review the laws relating to children, which involves assessing social services, the legal and health and education systems, as well as levels of funding of these services. Governments are obliged to take all necessary steps to ensure that the minimum standards set by the convention are met.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2988076">The government was late in responding to questions that were posed in March by the United Nations committee reviewing Canada's participation in this protocol. The questions were to be answered by July 2, but the answers were in fact delivered to the UN committee just last Friday. This week in Geneva, the committee is reviewing Canada's record and we anticipate a response shortly. However, it was very troubling for us that Canada took all that time to respond to those questions. There are people out there, with perhaps a more cynical view than my own, who are concerned that the Conservatives' reasons for not responding earlier are that they did not want their response open to public scrutiny before they were delivered to the UN, and perhaps to face the potential questions that might have been asked internally within Canada.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2988077">As the government's response to the UN committee suggests, it does not track the numbers of children under state care. People have asked for and tried to get from the government just how many are under state care. One has to wonder whether it does not have the available information to work with. The office of a commissioner would do precisely that. It would accumulate the necessary information regarding the services provided, the number of children receiving them and the various levels of need in our country. It is important that people stop and ask themselves if that is not a role that a commissioner would offer to Canadians and to the government in support of the work of the government. In some senses, when the Conservatives took office we had the Parliamentary Budget Officer put into place to take an arm's length view of government operations, someone who could report to the Canadian people and the House. This would be something similar to protect the rights of children and to ensure that we meet the obligations that we have signed up to. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2988078">The international agreements that Canada is party to are significant, given they have been negotiated and put in place for the benefit of children in this case, or in other protocols to prevent torture and other aspects. The agreements are important because they reflect Canada's international reputation for how we treat our own citizenry in the public context. We can say, as a government, that we are doing these things but having a commissioner would add to the veracity of those statements.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988079">Federal and provincial ministers are responsible for social policy, as just one example. However, they have not met in five years despite the fact there is evidence out there, which we believe, that children are falling through the cracks.</ParaText>

Committee members said that Canada's biggest challenge is to bring together the various parts of its political system to implement the convention throughout Canada and to improve the conditions for our most vulnerable children.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988081"> One could ask: Would that not be a role suited to a commissioner, as has been proposed by our friend from <Affiliation DbId="170257" Type="2">Westmount—Ville-Marie</Affiliation>? I think so.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988082">The Canadian response to the committee cites that first nations children are 4.2 times more likely to be investigated by child welfare officials than non-aboriginal children, and that this is driven by neglect linked to poverty, substance abuse, social isolation and domestic violence.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988083"> The government claims that coordination between the federal and provincial and territorial governments occurs, but the reality is that the relationship is between low-level officials who exchange information and call it coordination.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988084">Current mechanisms for coordination serve to kind of grey the area around what is happening more than actually bringing things to the fore. In fact it could be argued that they protect government decisions from public scrutiny. They do not serve children.</ParaText>

This would be another valuable tool, a force to pull it together in a way that would ensure the best possible delivery.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988087">The government has claimed, repeatedly, in public that the universal child care benefit is designed specifically to help families pay for child care. In the section on poverty, in the recent response to the UN committee on the rights of children, the benefit is presented as a poverty reduction program. At $100 a month, it does neither effectively and most of the money goes to non-poor families.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988088">Again, would this not be a place where a commissioner could insert himself or herself into the process to advise the government to make the appropriate changes?</ParaText><ParaText id="2988089">There are various tax credits that we hear spoken of, such as the child tax credit, the fitness and arts credits and RESPs that benefit the wealthy more than the people who are below the poverty line.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988090"> There are a lot of places where a commissioner could be inserted.</ParaText>

Everyone has a vested interest in ensuring every child is provided with the opportunity to succeed in life. </ParaText>

The bill proposes to create the office of the federal children's commissioner with a broad mandate to report on Canada's compliance with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988121">However, our government is of the view that Bill <Document DbId="5514117" Type="4">C-420</Document> is not the most effective means of achieving this laudable goal. We oppose the bill for four main reasons: One, it would be costly to establish and maintain; two, it would duplicate existing international reporting processes; three, it would replicate current domestic implementation mechanisms; and four, it could indirectly impact upon provincial and territorial areas of responsibility.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988122">As to the costs associated with this initiative, our first concern with the bill is related to the potential costs. It would be difficult to justify creating another layer of bureaucracy for reporting and monitoring purposes in this current climate of fiscal restraint. The costs could be somewhere in the vicinity of $7 million annually, which is the net cost of comparable independent commissioner offices.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988123"> It is our view that federal funding would be better spent on actual programs and services for Canadian children and youth rather than on creating an office that would produce more reports. I will speak to this issue in more detail in a few minutes.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2988124">The second concern we have with the bill is that Canada already reports to the UN on its implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. We do this every five years. Canada also covers children's issues in its reporting on a multitude of other international human rights treaties including, but not limited to, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988125">Our third concern is that many of the functions of the proposed federal children's commissioner are already being performed through existing domestic mechanisms. For instance, the government promotes public awareness of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, reviews proposed legislation and regulations for consistency with human rights protections, and promotes the ongoing implementation of the convention through the provision of legal advice and training. Moreover, parliamentary bodies have and continue to conduct special studies on children's issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988126">Effective domestic coordination is already in place through various interdepartmental and intergovernmental mechanisms. For example, in 2007, an interdepartmental working Group on children's rights was created to enhance federal coordination with respect to children's rights.</ParaText>

Most of the programs and services relating to children fall within provincial and territorial jurisdiction. Almost all the provinces and territories have established independent children's commissioners, advocates or ombudspersons.

This is in addition to other supports, including the child tax credit and the Canada child tax benefit, which includes the national child benefit supplement.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2988134">Through the supporting families fund, the government offers $60 million per year for family justice services and information resources aimed at promoting compliance with financial support and custody access obligations in order to reduce the stress of separation and divorce on children and assisting parents to focus on the best interests of the child when deciding on parenting arrangements.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988135">The government also provides $4.5 million per year through the youth justice fund for the development, implementation and evaluation of pilot projects that provide programming and services for youth in conflict with the law, such as children involved in or vulnerable to gun, gang and drug activities, and for youth with illicit substance abuse issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988136">Through the victims fund, this government has doubled the amount of money available for child advocacy centres across Canada, to a total of $2.05 million per year. Child advocacy centres adopt a seamless, coordinated and collaborative approach to helping child and youth victims of crime to minimize system-induced trauma by providing services to young victims and their families in child-friendly settings and by reducing the number of interviews and questions directed at children during the investigation or court preparation process. This has been a very successful initiative. I have visited some of these centres.</ParaText>

Another site, again at National Defence, is in Saint-Gabriel-de-Valcartier. It is the same thing: hydrocarbons. There, they are saying 2030 or 2031 for decontamination. There are 13 other sites at National Defence, and they are saying 2023 or 2024 for decontamination. </ParaText><ParaText id="2988159"> I want to know what the <Affiliation DbId="165138" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> is doing.

Our government has been working hard over the last several years of our tenure to ensure that the great plan we have in place, the contaminated sites action plan, has been well financed and implemented. We have been taking concrete action to address federal contaminated sites and the federal contaminated sites action plan is a 15-year program that is providing $3.5 billion in cost-shared funding to 16 federal departments and agencies for the assessment and remediation of high-priority federal contaminated sites.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988161">To address her questions about the province of Quebec, over $93 million has been earmarked and spent to address contaminated sites in Quebec since 2005. Of the 22,300 sites listed in the federal inventory, about 2,200 or 10% of the inventory are in Quebec. Of those 2,200 sites, close to 900 are now closed. That is significant progress for the period that our government has been involved.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2988162">A closed site is one that requires no further action, either because an assessment of the site has found that there was no contamination present or because remediation has been completed. Therefore, 40% of all sites in Quebec are now in this closed category. This is great news for all Quebeckers and this represents good progress.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988163">I want to point out that of the remaining 1,300 sites in Quebec that have not been closed, about 1,100 are currently either being assessed or, if action is needed, being remediated or risk managed. This represents 85% of the remaining sites in Quebec that are currently being worked on or have been worked on in the past. This leaves about 200 suspected sites that still require assessment. </ParaText><ParaText id="2988164">Under the Treasury Board Secretariat policy on management of real property, deputy heads are responsible for ensuring that known and suspected contaminated sites are assessed and classified and risk management principles are applied for each site. Priority must be given to sites posing the highest human health and ecological risk.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2988165">Consistent with this policy direction, the evidence suggests that departments have been focusing on assessing and remediating the highest risk sites. In the early years of the federal contaminated sites action plan, about half of these assessments resulted in a site being found to be contaminated. More recently, only about one in five assessments actually found contamination. This shift indicates that departments have assessed and remediated the highest risk sites and are now finding fewer suspected sited to be contaminated. This is good news. It also means that of the remaining suspected sites in the inventory, including those in Quebec, many will be found to not be contaminated or require action. This is a track record that our government can be proud of.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988166">The federal contaminated sites action plan program will continue through to 2020. We are halfway through the program now. We have made great progress and the Government of Canada will continue to address contaminated sites in the federal inventory. I am confident that we will continue to address the legacy of past practices to create a cleaner environment for future generations.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988167">I hope my colleague can see that the inventory we have addressed in Quebec shows good progress not only for the country but for her constituents and her riding in the province of Quebec. I am certainly proud of this record and our government will continue to improve upon it.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I want to pass along my thoughts and prayers in relation to what happened in Saint Boniface yesterday with that large fire. Let us hope that everyone who was involved is okay. </ParaText><ParaText id="2988176">Now I will turn to the subject matter that we are talking about this evening. Far too many small businesses in Canada are struggling due to the burden of credit card fees. With all the financial uncertainty that small businesses face in the current economic climate, the extra burden of some of the highest merchant fees in the world is an unwanted and unneeded encumbrance. </ParaText><ParaText id="2988177">It is estimated that Canadian businesses pay $5 billion a year to process credit card payments. These costs in turn are pushed on to the consumer as all prices are hiked to cover the cost of processing credit cards, regardless of the type of payment a consumer uses. Credit card users get some of these costs offset by rewards, such as air miles or cash back, but cash and debit users are the ones footing the bill for these perks. Essentially, everyone pays for Canada's artificially inflated credit card merchant fees. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2988178">The NDP has raised this issue time and time again, but the government's response has been slow and shortsighted. The government introduced a voluntary code of conduct, which it claimed would protect merchants. However, the code is riddled with holes. For example, the code states that merchants must have a 30-day grace period to cancel agreements when rates rise. However, some payment processing companies are now forcing merchants to sign lease agreements for credit card terminals that do not have this grace period and that have sky-high cancellation costs, effectively forcing merchants to stick with the processor even when the rates jump.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988179">The biggest concern that I have heard about the code of conduct is its voluntary nature. Although the minister likes to argue that the code is only voluntary until it is broken, this makes little to no sense. If the minister believes the code is mandatory then it should be enshrined in legislation. That way everyone knows exactly where they stand. That would remove the risk that further down the road government would simply disregard the code without parliamentary approval. We have seen this with the Ombudsman for Banking Services and Investments. It is far too easy for a voluntary agreement, especially with the industry and the government, to be tossed aside. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2988180">The government had the perfect opportunity to fix the system with the publication of the final report of the payments task force earlier this year. The report painted a dark picture of the state of the payment system in Canada with a number of useful suggestions for moving forward. However, the Conservatives have still refused to act on these recommendations. A bill to rectify these problems would provide the perfect opportunity to codify rules to protect merchants from high payment processing and costs, and kickstart the economy. </ParaText><ParaText id="2988181">I know my time is wrapping up. I would love to talk a lot more on this subject. I am sure we will be back again another day soon, but on that, if we do not act soon, merchants and consumers will risk being left behind. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="35">(1935)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Answer" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mrs. Glover" id="7702100"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170860" Type="18">Mrs. Shelly Glover (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2988182">Mr. Speaker, I also want to take a moment to thank my colleague across the way, whose kind words about the fire that took place in St. Boniface are touching. I know his concern is genuine.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988183">Back to the matter at hand, I find it somewhat ironic that the New Democrats would talk about the credit card companies as those that would fill their coffers with the money of hard-working Canadians with hidden fees and hidden costs. That is exactly what the NDP is trying to do with its massive carbon tax scheme, which is hidden in plain sight in its 2011 election platform.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988184">This scheme clearly states that the New Democrats would have a $21 billion cost to taxpayers in the form of higher taxes. However, they claim that Canadians would not have to pay this tax. I am quite confused when I try to think about the fact that taxes are paid by Canadians, yet they want to raise revenues of $21 billion with its carbon scheme and they say that Canadians will not pay it. I would like to reassure Canadians about this and give my learned colleague an opportunity to explain that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2988185">Back to other forms of payments that Canadians make, this government has taken their concerns as consumers very seriously. We have done that by ensuring that we have put in place some measures that protect them as consumers.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988186">Let us look at the facts behind some of the things that have been done by this government. Look at the new rules, which we consider to be strong, pro-consumer rules that help protect Canadians. We see things that we have put in place, for example, the summary boxes on contracts and applications to ensure Canadians know exactly what their applications say, and the clearer information on implications of minimum payments. Those are things we were asked for. Also, the timely advance disclosure of interest rate changes is something we were asked for.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988187"> Moreover, we believe Canadians should not need to have a magnifying glass or dictionary to read their credit card agreement or application and they should not have to be a lawyer or an economist to understand it. That is why we are forcing greater clarity and more timely disclosure from credit card issuers when dealing with consumers.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988188"> In addition, the new rules will limit other business practices that are not beneficial to consumers, including requiring a minimum 21-day grace period on all new purchases, express consent for credit limit increases and limits on debt collection practices.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2988189"> What is most disconcerting is that a number of these pro-consumer measures were put forward and we sought the collaboration of the New Democrats and their votes to promote and stand behind our Canadian consumers. Unfortunately, the NDP, time and time again, voted against these measures to protect consumers.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988190">The Canadian Consumers' Association agreed with this government's position on these measures when it said, “All of the things that the [finance minister has] done...are actually just what we asked for” and “overall, "I've got to congratulate [him]”. Therefore, why does the NDP vote against Canadian consumers and the Canadian Consumers' Association?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The voluntary code is toothless. I have expressed some examples that merchants are bringing forward saying that there are loopholes in here that these companies are going around and they are still being affected. There are $5 billion in costs going onto our small businesses. These small businesses then have to raise their prices, which affects every consumer.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988192"> Therefore, rather than talk about the voluntary code, which is toothless, let us talk about ways that the government can actually fix this and enshrine it in legislation to ensure we can close the loopholes. Otherwise, at the end of the day, it is consumers and small businesses that will continue to be hurt, and right now we need to fix this because they are our largest employers right across our great country.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I will side with the small businesses on this issue that actually agree with this government's measures to protect their interests. When we talk about things like our government's measure to ban unsolicited credit card checks, they agree with this side. When we talk about banning the negative option billing for financial products, Canadian consumers and small businesses agree with this government. Yet the NDP voted against both of those measures. </ParaText><ParaText id="2988194">Why did NDP members also oppose requiring greater disclosure on mortgage prepayment charges? Why did they oppose improving consumer protection by more than doubling the maximum fine on financial institutions that violate consumer provisions? These are among a number of negative votes by the NDP against some measures to protect consumers.</ParaText><ParaText id="2988195">I would invite my learned friend to join with us the next time we put forward measures to protect consumers and to vote with us so their interests are much better protected on all sides of the House.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
