Business services and programs are, for the most part, delivered by third parties such as the community futures corporations or the women’s enterprise initiative.

The motion is a call for the introduction of a credit card accountability, responsibility and disclosure act.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419772">The motion calls for immediate government action to protect consumers already hit by this recession from sky-rocketing credit card interest rates and fees.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419773">The motion would introduce legislation similar to Obama's credit card accountability, responsibility and disclosure act 2009.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419774">The New Democrats want the government to take action to protect consumers and small businesses from these confusing, misleading and predatory practices. New Democrats have always stood up for middle class families and small businesses, both groups who are suffering most in this economic downturn and with the current credit card practices.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419775">The motion lays out an eight point plan that would protect consumers from the gouging they have endured over the last little while. </ParaText><ParaText id="1419776">The first point of this proposal is the protection of cardholders from any time, any reason interest rate increases or account changes. The Canadian Community Reinvestment Coalition has repeatedly called on credit card companies to demonstrate that rate hikes are justified. In the Canadian regulatory framework no such requirement is in place. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1419777">We are not advocating that banks make public proprietary information that is part of a competitive marketplace, but we want a regulatory framework with teeth that can ensure effective protection through a process of independent auditing against arbitrary gouging.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419778">Another point of the motion is to prohibit unfair application of card payments. Credit card issuers frequently offer short-term, lower rates to entice consumers to transfer credit from a competitor to credit cards they have issued. In the short-term this represents a savings. The problem is in the fine print and the short-term rates disappear quickly.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419779">Further, as purchases are made customers will find that rates are applied differently within their account. Currently, the customer cannot choose to pay down credit with the highest rate. We are calling on the government to protect consumers by ensuring they have the choice that best suits them.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419780">Credit cardholders who pay on time need to be protected. I have been hearing from people all across Canada who are outraged that even when they have a spotless credit history, they are getting hit with big rate increases.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1419781">A man from Victoria, B.C., has been a credit cardholder with a certain bank for over 20 years. Earlier this year he received a letter from his bank outlining important changes to his account. In the letter it stated that as of a little over a month later his interest would increase. This man was quite confused and rightly upset by this as he felt like he was being punished with an increase in the interest rate when he had done nothing wrong and there was nothing wrong with his credit. In fact, it was excellent.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419782">This man, like hundreds of other Canadians, had done nothing to breach his agreement with his credit card company but was still being hit with a higher rate. The motion also calls on the government to limit abusive fees and penalties charged by credit card companies.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419783">Credit card companies gouge consumers with many unreasonable fees and interest. They can charge over limit fees over and over again during one billing cycle. Also, we have examples of credit card companies enticing customers with an introductory 1.9% interest rate which can jump to almost 25% in two months should cardholders be even a day late on their payment.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1419784">We also want to prohibit card issuers from using a consumer's card history with one creditor to allow for interest rate hikes on another. Credit card companies can increase interest rates and terms for reasons unrelated to a card holder's behaviour on that card.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419785">For example, if my neighbour pays his gas bill late, his credit card company can raise the interest rate on his credit card. Even if he is a day late, it could result in an interest rate hike without the card holder knowing.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1419786">How can these billion dollar companies justify hiking interest rates on a cardholder who is one or two days late on a payment by an additional 6% in some cases? I have heard of cases that hiked these rates even more.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419787">If I get my credit card bill this month, and let us say this bill is about $1,000 and I pay $800 toward this bill, the next month the interest I am paying will be calculate on the $1,000, not the $200 remaining. Only in June would I pay interest on that $200 as long as I did not put more expenses on the card.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419788">Our motion calls on the government to prohibit issuers from charging interest on debt that is already paid. This is unfair and gouges consumers even further.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419789">This motion also calls for ensuring cardholders are informed of the terms of their account. Most consumers are unaware that these new premium cards that are being sent to them, unsolicited in many instances I might add, are reducing the already small margins of profits made by local and small businesses. With charges of up to 4% on the total price of the sale instead of a flat transaction cost, businesses on the brink are being pushed closer and closer to the edge.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419790">Our motion would ensure that cardholders are informed of the terms of their account and that it costs merchants more when using premium cards.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1419791">This motion also calls for the protection of young consumers from aggressive credit card solicitation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419792">I have too many examples of students who work part-time jobs and are juggling minimum wage jobs who are being aggressively pursued by credit card companies to sign up for credit cards. These students need protection from the predatory practices of credit card companies that run aggressive mailing and marketing campaigns on their campuses.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419793">Right now the average Canadian student debt among those who borrow and graduate from a four year program is already $22,700. Credit card debt will only further burden these students.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419794">Canada is not the only country focusing its attention on this issue. Renewed effort by governments in the United States and recent action in the European Union illustrate a global push to hold credit card companies to account for their fee practices. It is time our government focuses its attention on this matter as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419795">In a poll conducted by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, one in five consumers reported receiving unsolicited premium cards which come with higher interest rates. The majority of those who receive these high interest cards were the poor, elderly and least educated.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1419796">We cannot count on credit card companies to police themselves or to be concerned about the most vulnerable. That is our job. It is time government stepped in to help families in these tough times, which is why I am pleased to table this motion today in the House.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

At the very beginning of his speech, he referred to the fact that members of the NDP have stood up for Canadians. We put provisions in budget 2009 that actually pre-empted a lot of what is suggested in this motion that this government should do. I cannot help but wonder why on earth his entire party voted against that. To their credit, the Liberals understood the value that was in our economic action plan and supported it. That is going forward. The money is going out for infrastructure. </ParaText><ParaText id="1419810">There is one comment that I would like to ask the hon. member to clarify. He suggested that there is interest charged on credit cards even when they are paid off on time.

					<Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Thibeault" id="2713602"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128626" Type="2">Mr. Glenn Thibeault</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1419811">Mr. Speaker, first, what was in the budget was just more information about what is on the back of a credit card bill. There was no true legislation to protect consumers and that is why we are debating this motion today.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419812">In relation to the parliamentary secretary's question, I was using the example of my own credit card bill. If I had a credit card bill of $1,000 and I paid $800 of that, $200 would be remaining. I would have to pay the interest on the $1,000, not on the $200. We want to see limits that prohibit that type of gouging.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Allen (Welland)" id="2713618"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128407" Type="2">Mr. Malcolm Allen (Welland, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1419813">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128626" Type="2">Sudbury</Affiliation> for his leadership on this issue. He has been front and centre on this issue for quite some time. If my memory serves me correctly, he has asked quite a number of questions of the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> about this very issue and the minister's response has been that he would write a letter. The Conservatives' action plan probably contains a copy of that letter. Clearly we want to see action on this critical issue of credit cards and the usurious fees and interest rates that Canadians are suffering under, not just this year when there is a huge economic downturn in the economy, but in the years leading up to it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1419814">Credit card interest rates pushing 20% are painful at the best of times, but they are simply outrageous when people are losing their jobs and facing real hardship. People in my riding of Welland are being hard hit by this recession. Soaring interest rate charges are trapping more and more families into a cycle of poverty. In times like these, hard-working families can quickly find themselves running credit card balances just to make ends meet. Unfair interest rates can blow that balance into a major financial burden that is extremely difficult for families to crawl back from, especially when people are losing their jobs or having the door to employment insurance slammed shut by the government's refusal to make the changes necessary for them to access the money they paid into that insurance program which was originally set up for that exact purpose.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419815">Today Canadian households owe a staggering $300 billion on credit cards and other high interest debts. That kind of debt can entrap the most hard-working families. One alarming result is that the average savings rate has dropped from 20% in the mid-1980s to barely 2% today. That is not nearly enough to retire on. The NDP is committed to renewing our call to cap credit card rates at five points over the prime rate in good times and indeed in bad. That is fair and affordable for the average family.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1419816">As has been touched upon, in the U.S. the new Obama administration has announced plans to protect consumers from unfair credit card practices. It is time for the Conservative government to be committed to protecting Canadians also.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419817"> I say that in the context of my region, which has the second highest unemployment rate in this country. Folks are using their credit cards to buy food. Quite a number of years ago we could not use a credit card at the grocery store. In fact, the best we could do was write a cheque, but in this day and age of plastic, most places do not want a cheque; they want a credit card. Folks are actually going to grocery stores to buy the essentials and necessities of life and they are using a credit card that they know has a balance with an interest rate that is simply driving them further and further into debt. They end up potentially being trapped in a cycle of poverty. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1419818">When I think about that, I have never used a credit card in the grocery store, but I have used it numerous times at major retailers. I have had that credit card for some 20 years. Like many other Canadians, I received a notification out of the blue that told me my credit card interest rate was going to be increased by 2.5%. There was no reason given. It was not that I had not paid my bill on time, or was late, or carried a balance forward for too many months. In fact, I do not carry a balance on that card and never have. Before that, I had been told by that company that I was one of its preferred customers because indeed I paid my bill on time. Now I am about to be penalized because I pay on time. It seems that when it comes to credit cards, we get penalized when we do not pay on time and we get penalized if we do pay on time.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1419819">In yesterday's press, Bank of Canada Governor Mr. Carney talked about where he thought he would see the Bank of Canada interest rate in the foreseeable future. I believe that the inter-bank rate is less than 1.5%, and the prime rate is somewhere around 4.5% depending on whether one is a preferred customer. Yet we see credit card rates at all-time highs of 19.5% to 20%. We understand there has to be a spread between the prime rate and the retail rate, but clearly when there is a spread close to 15% or 16% and in some cases 19% or 20% for a retail credit card, that really is usury. It used to be in this country that those types of rates could not be charged, that it would be loansharking.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1419820">It seems to me that if we do not rein them in, we may want to call credit cards something else. They should be called debt cards, because that is what they trap folks in. They trap them into a cycle of debt. It is not about extending credit to people; it is about hooking them.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1419821"> The credit card companies, through the banks and the other major financial institutions, have done a great job of ensuring that people get a card. The hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128626" Type="2">Sudbury</Affiliation> talked about how they trap young people. I have kids who are young adults now. They have grown up and have gone to university. They got their first credit card in the mail, unsolicited, just as they were about to leave high school. The cards showed up at our address, one after the other, for the three of them. I have twins who were born only three minutes apart. They got their cards on the same day. They did not ask for one. The cards did not come from the financial institution where they had their meagre savings accounts. It was not even their financial institution that sent them the credit cards thinking they might like to have a credit card. It was an altogether different institution that did not know them, but knew they were young people. The note that came with the cards indicated that as they head off to post-secondary education they may need a credit card. I would say that they did not need a credit card. What they needed was a good summer job to pay for that education.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1419822">Clearly, these companies have hooked young people, and they have hooked old people, in the sense of mature people like me, into using credit cards for their everyday existence. People are building up balances on their cards which at one time would be unthinkable. At one time, most folks had meagre amounts owing on their credit cards. Purchases were for $50, $60 and $70 at a time. Now they are in the hundreds of dollars. This convenience card, as it started out to be, is now portrayed as a need, that we need to have one in our lives because if we did not have one, we would not be able to do the things we should be doing and purchasing the things that we need to have in the lives we lead in this society. Financial institutions have been given that ability to continue to hook consumers, to have them believe that the cards are absolutely are essential.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419823">For a long time my mother never had a credit card. She was in her fifties before she had one because she did not think she needed one. She thought she should just pay cash. She came from an era in which people paid cash for everything. She actually went to a store where she was encouraged not to pay with cash, but to pay with a credit card. When she said she did not have one, the store said it could get one for her, and the cycle begins.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1419824">In my estimation, there is not a real need to see that cycle continue in that form. We need to ensure that we limit the ability of the financial institutions to dangle that bait of convenience that really becomes the trap of high interest rates, and poverty for some, and a debt load that is now unmanageable for a great many Canadians across the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419825"> I am sure the banks are going to argue that these are really tough times and there are a lot of folks defaulting on the balances of their credit cards. Of course they are. If the banks had not driven the interest rate up to 19.5%, but had kept it at a reasonable rate, which would be somewhere around 9% to 10%, in fact people may have been able to handle the debt load, and perhaps eventually paid it off. What is going to happen is that debt is certainly going to accumulate.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1419826">As my colleague mentioned, yes, interest is paid on the $1,000 even if a payment of $800 has been made. It is in the fine print, and I defy anyone to try to read that fine print without a magnifying glass. Mr. Speaker, I know I am not supposed to demonstrate, but they are my glasses, and what I do with mine is that I actually move the bad lens over the good eye so that I actually can read that fine print because it is that difficult, even for me.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419827">Ultimately this is about the protection of consumers who are saying to us that they are stuck, that they need our help. They have tried to negotiate. They have tried to argue. They have tried to get out from underneath the interest rate trap they are in with the credit card companies and financial institutions and the institutions will not let them out. We need to help those Canadians. I sincerely hope the members of this House will support this motion and make sure that Canadians, consumers, families, young people across this country, can get out from underneath the trap of credit card debt.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I suggest that the fee the credit card companies charge small businesses is overblown. If we let them creep into the debit card market, that fee will go even higher. Owners of small businesses in my riding tell me not to let this happen. They tell me that we need to talk to the credit card companies to ensure the fees are kept down, and we need to continue do that.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419834">My hon. colleague is also right about the fact that at one time if people paid $10 or $20 in cash, they would receive a discount. Back then they were asked by the retailer if they wanted to pay cash or use credit. It was a phrase often heard at retailers and a discount was given for cash because retailers knew the cost to them. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1419835">That really is the hook. Not only have consumers been hooked, but so have businesses, to the point where people really do not want to deal with cash or cheque. They want to deal with plastic because it is easier to do transactions that way, yet we do not see a reduction in the cost to us because of the ease of the transaction. </ParaText><ParaText id="1419836">It is all done electronically. As my colleague said, the onion skin paper is not seen any more except in a few places that I happen to visit. It is amazing technology. People can go here or there and yet they do not get the benefit of the reduced cost that the big financial institutions receive. That is a shame and it should be reversed.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Specifically the text mentions that Canada should adopt legislation similar to the credit card accountability, responsibility and disclosure act of 2009, introduced by the Obama administration in the United States. The NDP's push for Canada, which has the strongest banking system in the world, to junk its banking system model for that of another country is odd at best.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419844">I suggest the NDP listen to the words of Paul Volcker, chairman of President Obama's economic recovery advisory board.

							</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1419846">I would like the House to note that the credit card accountability, responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 was not introduced by the Obama administration. This is not some point of debate; it is a fact. It is a fact that is pretty easy to verify. Those at home watching and are near a computer should take a minute to Google it. They will find the act was introduced by the senator from Connecticut, Christopher Dodd. Mr. Dodd is not a member of President Obama's administration.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419847">I also did a little research, and by “little”, I mean about five minutes, which the member for <Affiliation DbId="128626" Type="2">Sudbury</Affiliation> could have and should have done. I quickly discovered that Senator Dodd first introduced the bill in the 108th Congress on July 22, 2004. I believe he has reintroduced it every congress since. I do not have to Google to remember that it was not the Obama administration that was in power back then, but rather it was the Bush administration.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419848">How and why is the member for <Affiliation DbId="128626" Type="2">Sudbury</Affiliation> claiming a proposal that a Connecticut senator first introduced in 2004 during the Bush administration can now be called an initiative of President Obama's administration? It was not and it cannot be. It was just some sloppy research that is unbecoming of Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419849">In essence, what we are debating today is basically an American senator's private member's bill. The senator informs us:</ParaText>

							</ParaText><ParaText id="1419851">Indeed, Senator Dodd is pretty adamant that this bill, “Is what the American people and the people of Connecticut are demanding”.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419852">I bet people are wondering what all that has to do with Canada. Luckily for the Parliament of Canada and the people of Canada, according to the logic behind today's NDP motion, all of Senator Dodd's colleagues in the Senate who he mentioned, along with those American-based consumer advocates and labour organizations as well and the people of Connecticut, were kind enough to consider the impact and the effects the bill would have on Canada. This would be funny if it were not actually being debated in this Parliament in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419853">Clearly, I suggest for the member for <Affiliation DbId="128626" Type="2">Sudbury</Affiliation> that Senator Dodd and company did not talk to Canadians about his bill, and that means this bill was not designed for Canada's superior financial system. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1419854">Some will suggest that does not matter, that it is the broad intent of the proposals in the bill that matter. I respectfully disagree. I think it does matter. Canadians did not send us to Parliament to merely copy and paste legislation from another country, as much of a great neighbour as that country may be. Canadians want their elected representatives and their federal government to develop legislation that takes into account their needs. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="55">(1055)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1419855">With all due respect to the Connecticut Public Interest Research Group and the Connecticut Association for Human Services, relying on consultations done with the groups that operate in different counties does not and cannot accurately reflect the needs of Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419856">The motion is especially jarring because it essentially discounts and ignores committee hearings that are taking place or are about to take place in Canada's House of Commons and in the Senate and the recommendations or suggestions that those hearings could provide and replaces these with a made in Connecticut proposal. I would suggest that it is ill-advised to buy legislation off the shelf.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419857">However, what can one reasonably expect from the NDP? When it comes to reflecting the needs of Canadian consumers and investors, the NDP members have gone beyond simply failing. They have been missing in action. They clearly have not been doing their homework. They have developed a pattern of voting against every major initiative that this government has brought forward to protect consumers, improve financial literacy or to help investors.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419858">The most obvious example is today's motion, which claims the NDP wants legislation introduced to allow the government to protect credit card consumers. In fact, we already did that and the NDP voted against it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1419859"> Specifically, our economic action plan announced that our Conservative government would enact regulations to strengthen the disclosure requirements for federally regulated financial institutions that issued credit cards. This would allow consumers to benefit from clearer and simpler summary information on credit card application forms and contracts and from clearer and more timely advance notice of changes in rates and fees.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419860">Catherine Swift, president of Canadian Federation of Independent Business, appearing before a Senate committee, lent her voice in support of such a change, explaining:</ParaText><ParaText id="1419861"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Who reads fine print?

They end up paying a lot more money than they need to.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1419863">We are not done, though. We will also enhance consumer protection by limiting business practices that do not benefit consumers. For example, we will require a minimum grace period on new purchases made with a credit card and move to improve the debt collection practices of federally regulated financial institutions.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1419864">As I mentioned, the changes that were proposed in the budget were significant. They were developed in Canada in response to needs and concerns of our Canadian market and applauded by public interest groups based in Canada, groups like the Public Interest Advocacy Centre, which noted “reaction to the fact the government is moving in this direction is a positive one”.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419865">Again, did NDP members support any of these measures to protect consumers? No, they voted against them, a vote of opposition that they have yet to explain to Canadians. However, it does not stop there.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419866">The pattern of opposition continues and extends to improving financial literacy to ensure Canadians have the knowledge to make informed financial decisions. Financial literacy, the ability to understand personal and broad financial matters, to apply that knowledge and assume responsibility for one's financial decisions, is becoming an increasingly vital life skill for Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419867">We had recognized from the start of our government, and we have been actively supporting initiatives to improve it since.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419868"> Starting in budget 2007 and carrying on into budget 2008, our Conservative government made investments in new funding into the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada. I encourage all Canadians to visit its website at www.fcac.gc.ca. This is very important in helping to improve financial literacy in Canada, but both times the NDP voted against that funding. The pattern continues. </ParaText>

This appears more like the anti-consumer protection agenda of the NDP.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419877">We see this also in the lack of support of a new national regulator to support consumers or investors of securities. This is an issue that many people often do not understand at first glance, but as it is explained they quickly understand why improving Canada's securities framework is so vital.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419878">We are an investing country, plain and simple. Canadians own RRSPs, equities, mutual funds and other investments. These nest eggs represent Canadians' financial future.

I am going to offer some research tips to my hon. colleague. </ParaText><ParaText id="1419894">Instead of googling, I suggest he maybe take a walk down Wellington Street to the Rideau Centre and talk to consumers who are paying with their credit cards and then realizing that they are being gouged with a 25% interest rate when they have to pay their bill. How about taking some research down to the local food bank and seeing families that are having to use the food bank because they are unemployed?

I am sure I had equally harsh words for the Conservatives.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419915">However, I should at least clarify to the House that if I said those words about the NDP not understanding economics or being Luddites, those words were not intended to be directed to the provincial wing of the New Democratic Party, but solely to the federal wing, because the fact of the matter is that over the past decades, the NDP provincially has gained power and some provincial NDP governments have been very good. In fact, they have been rather like Liberal governments. We think of Gary Doer and Roy Romanow, excellent leaders with excellent economic policies.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419916"> Therefore, the ignorance on economics and the Luddite nature of thinking is limited to the federal branch of the party, and partly that is because the party has never had power.

We will be listening to those witnesses with interest and based on that information draw our own conclusions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419922">Let me say a few words about why the American system is different from the Canadian system and why the measures that may be appropriate for the United States may not be appropriate for Canada. Canada has been characterized by our national banking system for many decades, whereas the United States has been characterized by a more dispersed banking system. Study after study has shown that credit card spreads and other spreads are indeed higher in the United States. Delinquency rates are higher in the United States. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1419923">Canada has not had the same kind of subprime mortgage crisis. It has to some degree, but not nearly to the same degree as in the United States. In particular, our banks did not extend credit and get into complicated or risky derivatives, subprime mortgages to nearly the same degree as was the case in the United States, so it is largely for those reasons that our banking system has not been hit with insolvency and loan losses in the trillions of dollars, which we in this country have not seen.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419924">I should also point out that the Conservatives cannot claim credit for the solidity of the Canadian banking system. I would argue that part of the explanation was the decision of the Chrétien government not permit mergers. Another part of the explanation is that we have had stronger regulation over many decades than was the case in the United States. So for all of those reasons we are fortunate to have a solid banking system in this country which, while certainly not universally loved, has performed much better than in the United States.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1419925">I say that to provide a little bit of perspective, but at the same time we are supporting the motion. We believe there are significant problems in the credit card sector that have to been addressed and that is what we Liberals are doing along with other parties. In committees we will be hearing witnesses, examining possible abuses, examining the possible need for greater clarity for consumers, greater protection for Canadians and proactive disclosure. </ParaText><ParaText id="1419926">While we do not support every item in this NDP motion, we can support the spirit of it for the reasons I have given and for that reason the Liberal Party will be supporting the motion.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

New Democrats led the way and said that is not a good idea and we should not deregulate the banks.

He claimed that it was the Bush administration that introduced it. Only a Conservative would stand up and defend Mr. Bush, but that is his prerogative to do that. I just find that very interesting.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419947">While I agree wholeheartedly with the need to protect Canadian consumers, particularly those who are most vulnerable in tough economic times, we must assess whether or not Canadians face the same threat that Americans do before determining whether or not to apply an American solution here in Canada. In other words, we cannot assume that what works south of the border will work here. While it would be foolish to object to protecting Canadian consumers from sudden interest rate increases and account changes, abusive fees and penalties and aggressive solicitation, it is yet unclear as to whether or not Canadians actually encounter exactly the same problems to the extent that American citizens do.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1419948">This is why we as Liberals have taken leadership on the issue by initiating three separate studies in order to make that determination. A study by the Senate committee on banking, trade and commerce is currently under way, and separate reviews by the finance and industry committees are set to begin in May. Each of these is designed to examine different elements of the credit card and debit card industries to determine what measures may be necessary in order to further protect Canadian consumers and merchants.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419949">By taking a more broad-based approach, one that includes protecting merchants as well as consumers, the idea is that we as Canadian lawmakers would be much better suited to address the issues that currently face Canadians rather than simply applying a cookie cutter approach that worked in the United States. I might add that this legislation, although it looks very good, is unproven in the United States.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419950">Here in Canada, for instance, consumer interest rates, late payment penalties and repayment terms are determined by banks and not the credit card companies themselves. As such, if we focus exclusively on the credit card companies and neglect the study of the banking institutions that actually establish the terms of the credit card account, then we would be doing a huge disservice to the Canadian public.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1419951">It is also worth noting that the proposals in the NDP motion which we are currently debating may not adequately address other concerns. For example, a recent poll commissioned by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business revealed that over the past 12 months, no fewer than 22% of Canadian credit cardholders have received additional cards from companies such as Visa and MasterCard with features such as travel points and extra insurance.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419952">Getting all this and not really asking for it really is a problem. People are being given stuff which they sometimes take. They think it is a great idea and they run with it. They think that because they got it, they deserved it. It really does impose a burden on people who would not otherwise have applied for it, or have done their homework and thought that they really could not afford it but they took it anyway. That is really where one of the issues lies. It is one of the problems.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419953">There is also mounting evidence that the so-called premium credit cards are now being directed toward low-income, elderly and otherwise vulnerable Canadians. For many consumers, they often do not know that they are being charged higher rates until they actually receive their bills.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1419954">The concerns in the United States may not be the same as the ones here. When we talk about our banking system, we do have a nice solid banking system that works. We were not plagued by the subprime problem, as was mentioned earlier. Those are issues that all have to be taken into consideration when we are looking at the legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419955">The legislation is appropriate and it may work, but it may have to be modified in order to adapt to Canadian realities. I mention this because while the motion we are currently debating stipulates consumers should be informed of the terms of their accounts, there is nothing in it that would prevent credit card companies from offering cards and upgrades to those people without being asked. I mentioned this earlier.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="35">(1135)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1419956">While there may be some people who feel that regulation in the electronic payment industry could be harmful to Canadians, and that is always something that is out there, I believe the only way to determine this for sure is to take a comprehensive approach to the issue, rather than trying to implement a one-size-fits-all solution.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419957">The NDP motion proposes that the U.S. legislation be applied in Canada. Canada's financial system is much stronger, as I mentioned earlier, than the United States' financial system. It is important to recognize that the problems consumers face with credit cards in the U.S. do not necessarily apply to all Canadians.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="1419958">One of the problems I also see here is that, before the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was in politics, he was opposed to what we had done with the banks. He wanted them to be able to do as they pleased. Now he boasts that we have a banking system here that is far better than anywhere else in the world. This leads me to wonder whether one can have confidence in a prime minister who changes his mind according to his circumstances, especially when something so fundamental is at stake. Before he entered politics, he wanted to take away all regulation of the banking system, and now he is congratulating himself on this system.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419959">So what are we to think of this <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>? Is he serious? Does he say things just to get votes? These are questions Canadians need to ask themselves. Who will protect us from the credit companies or banks? Who will protect them as well?

We have to think of what this Prime Minister believes, and what the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> believes. </ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="1419960">My Liberal colleagues and I believe there are significant issues that need to be examined with respect to credit cards, such as interest rates, disclosure of information and fees for consumers and retailers. </ParaText><ParaText id="1419961">While the Conservative Party's 2008 election platform pledged to protect consumers with stronger competition laws, it contained no mention of credit cards or their fees.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419962">In the 2009 budget, the government pledged, without giving details, that it would move to limit “business practices that are not beneficial to consumers”, noting that one measure would be to require minimum grace interest-free periods on new purchases. </ParaText><ParaText id="1419963">More recently, the <Affiliation DbId="128634" Type="2">finance minister</Affiliation> announced the creation of an advisory committee on finance to “ensure the availability of financing to Canadian businesses and consumers to support the economy and encourage growth”. While the <Affiliation DbId="128634" Type="2">finance minister</Affiliation> points to this work as an advisory board in response to questions about credit card rates and fees, it is unclear how the committee's mandate relates to specific issues like interest rates and interest rate increases, payment fees, account transparency and other issues listed in today's motion by the NDP.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419964">My Liberal colleagues and I will continue to pursue the tough questions regarding credit card companies and financial institutions to ensure that Canadian consumers are well-informed and are being treated fairly.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1419965"> I want to touch on one area that is very important, and that is the interchange fees that are charged to merchants. Fees can vary from one card to another. I think of a small merchant sitting there waiting for business. When there is a sales transaction and a card is used, he does not have the right to turn it down, yet those interchange fees are going to be charged to him. If one card charges 2% and another charges 6% or even more, it is very difficult for that small merchant to plan what his profits are going to be. I am not talking about just protecting the merchant here. That merchant provides jobs. Jobs are what we need in this economy. If we are not protecting that merchant from charges that he is not aware of, then we are killing jobs. This is something the government has to understand.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419966">In order to ensure that consumers are protected, I strongly believe that more information is needed. Once these studies are completed, I think we can take a look at it and ensure that we have everything we need to help the average Canadian.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419967">In the meantime, we will be supporting the NDP motion put forward by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128626" Type="2">Sudbury</Affiliation>, because we believe in protecting Canadians as much as possible.

We need to make sure that the merchants are healthy. Merchants employ people. When people have jobs, they can purchase goods, feed their families, earn a living. That is what we want in Canada. We want people to be able to pay their bills and do it independently. </ParaText><ParaText id="1419981">On the other hand, the member talked about the most vulnerable. One of the areas I think is most important is not to allow credit card companies to prey on vulnerable people by sending them cards they do not qualify for, sending them items they have not asked for or raising limits without having alerted them or asked their permission to raise them. People will often get letters from credit card companies congratulating them because their limit has been raised by $1,000 or whatever.

I said “obviously” because right now, two committees, the Standing Committee on Finance and the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, are considering the matter and will be reviewing these issues very soon.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419984">Also, witnesses are appearing before the Senate to air various points of view on a problem that consumers and merchants have known about for a long time, a problem that has gotten worse lately.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419985">The New Democratic Party's motion talks about consumer protection, but the motion moved in the Standing Committee on Finance also mentions merchants, who are also important players, subject to a rather complex process for credit card usage. In a way, sudden fee increases hurt them too.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1419986">If this hurts merchants, in the end, consumers will wind up paying for it. That is why we agree that this motion should call on the federal government to adopt measures to better protect consumers, but we must not forget that merchants are part of the process too.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419987">There is a lot we do not know. People do not know everything, and banks do not tell us everything about the credit card acquisition process and related regulations. It is complicated, and that is why people tend not to read all of the fine print in the contracts they sign.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419988">Under the current system, an individual can acquire a credit card and use it to pay a merchant. The merchant then has to deal with a credit card company, such as VISA, as well as with what is known as an acquirer, which provides a data transaction system. Credit card issuers, often banks, are also involved.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1419989">Popular imagery always focuses on the huge profits that the banks have been making for years, but I think it is important to again point out the full context and consider the fact that a great deal of information and education must be provided about the credit card system, in order to fully understand who is making profits, how companies are able to increase them and why they do so. </ParaText><ParaText id="1419990">We in the Bloc Québécois believe that the federal government must act. We therefore support the principle of this motion, so that in committee we may examine more closely the various issues we are dealing with today. However, although we support the principle, the federal government must definitely be extremely careful about respecting provincial jurisdictions and Quebec's jurisdictions if it takes any legislative action.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="50">(1150)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1419991">For example, since 1971, Quebec has had the Consumer Protection Act, which already provides a framework for the contractual agreements between credit card companies and consumers. If this motion passes and the federal government decides to go ahead with legislation, it will be important to respect Quebec's expertise and competence in this area. Furthermore, several incidents since 1971 have helped the Quebec government develop its competence in this area, which has even been recognized in a Supreme Court of Canada decision.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1419992">To analyze the overall situation, it must be seen in a very broad context. The current economic and financial crisis clearly shows that debt is a major problem in Quebec and in Canada. This situation is even worse for our neighbours to the south. Credit that was granted with very little background checking is what caused such massive debt and the current global crisis. This is prompting parliamentarians to have a look at the situation and think about what we can do to protect consumers and merchants.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1419993">We had some proof of that yesterday when the Bank of Canada once again reduced its key interest rate to 0.25%, which is an unprecedented low. For a long time, the spread between the Bank of Canada's prime rate and the rate financial institutions charge their clients who use credit cards has been far too great. Bank rates hover around 18% or 19%, or even 20%, when we now have a key interest rate of 0.25%. This is a disturbing problem that we must examine carefully.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419994">Why are we allowing banks to continue to rake in such huge profits at a time when consumers are increasingly vulnerable? The marketing techniques used by banks—a Liberal member was just talking about premium credit cards—have once again compounded the problem of the appeal for certain consumers. In fact, many consumers consider the use of a credit card issued by a bank and associated with a given product a way of profiting from their purchases.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1419995">However, we know very well, with regard to the matter of credit cards, that banks issue them in the hope that the holders will not pay the full balance of their purchases within one month. That is where the banks make their huge profits. Consumers are not very well educated about that. There is also a lack of knowledge about the fees charged to merchants who, quite often, do not understand what they are being charged and why their fees increase.</ParaText><ParaText id="1419996">Therefore, the Bloc Québécois supports this motion in principle but the government will have to exercise caution before going any further and be truly cognizant of the fact that there are other competent authorities in this matter, such as the provinces.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Since the Conservatives came to power, many people in the manufacturing and forestry industries in Quebec have been laid off, and communities are reeling from those layoffs. People are getting poorer, and unemployment is on the rise. Obviously, this is having an enormous impact on household debt, especially for young couples. </ParaText><ParaText id="1419998">I would like to talk about the NDP motion before I speak about the economic crisis and the solutions proposed by the Bloc Québécois.

It is immensely important to respect Quebec's expertise and jurisdiction.

It is also true that the difference between the Bank of Canada's key lending rate and credit card interest rates has been growing. I will talk more about that later because that gap is widening: 0.25% and 25% is scandalous. It is true that the big banks and financial institutions are the ones benefiting. We are eager to see their quarterly statements. Not all of the items in the motion fall under federal jurisdiction, as I pointed out earlier. However, I would like to see the federal government take action within its jurisdiction in this matter.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420013">For example, item (<I>a</I>) would be a good place to start. The federal government could consider linking credit interest rates to the Bank of Canada's key lending rate with reference to the criminal rate under section 347 of the Criminal Code, thereby doing a better job of synchronizing the cost of credit and the key lending rate. There are several ways to go about doing this. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="00">(1200)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1420014">One way is to determine in advance the difference between the Bank of Canada's key interest rate and what a credit card company can charge and express that difference as a percentage, a multiplier or a number. For example, there could be a maximum difference of 5% or two to three times the base rate. Currently, at 25%, the credit card interest rate is 100 times the Bank of Canada rate of 0.25%, which makes no sense. The current economic crisis is to blame for this situation, and we have to do something about it. In this Parliament, we can correct this situation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420015">This is a provincial jurisdiction. Quebec's Consumer Protection Act contains strict requirements governing all kinds of credit card contracts. For example, credit card issuers must send consumers an account statement that includes information such as the account balance, the date, the description and value of each transaction, the date and amount of each payment and the credit charges. This extremely precise and detailed information lets consumers make informed decisions.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420016">Section 128 of the Consumer Protection Act states that “Where the merchant has indicated to the consumer the amount up to which variable credit is extended to him, the merchant shall not increase such amount unless the consumer expressly applies therefor.” In addition, consumers must be given 30 days' advance notice of all changes.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420017">Credit cards are very expensive at present, especially when issuers charge between 18% and 29.9% interest. I will not name these companies, because it is easy to find this information on the Internet. A rate of 29.9% is really excessive and outrageous, when the Bank of Canada rate is just 0.25%. This has to change. Of course, the credit card companies say that their rates are so high because their risks are high, but perhaps they should reduce their risks by tightening the requirements for extending credit.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420018">This is not the first time the Bloc Québécois has been highly sensitive to the economic situation and its impact on consumers and citizens. In fact, the Bloc has brought forward a number of measures in that regard. One of the more recent ones was the action plan put forward on November 24. In this time of economic crisis, people really need help. This Parliament must adopt measures to help unemployed workers. In the November 24 action plan, the Bloc Québécois proposed realistic, specific and comprehensive measures. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420019">A few years ago, my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128293" Type="2">Hochelaga</Affiliation> introduced a bill in this House to prohibit banks from discriminating on the basis of social condition.

This is so important to us in our every day lives as Canadians in general, but even more important at this time of unprecedented economic downturn.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420046">Basically, this act calls upon the government to protect consumers, protect Canadians who are going through a difficult and rough time, and ensure that their livelihoods are being protected. In many ways, it is modelled along the initiative that the Obama administration south of us took in introducing a credit card accountability, responsibility and disclosure act just some time ago. It was something that was heralded as very good news and very important in protecting American consumers. The question remains, why can we not see the same done here?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420047">I would like to speak to this motion as the critic on youth issues. As a young person myself and the second-youngest person in the House of Commons, I speak in a place where not many people of my generation have the chance to speak. It is a tremendous honour to be here at my age and to represent the people of <Affiliation DbId="128733" Type="2">Churchill</Affiliation>, one of the youngest regions in Canada. However, I also hold it very important to represent my generation and people of a similar age whose voices, in many cases, are not heard.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420048">This bill seeks to protect all consumers. Particularly, it pays attention to the challenges and the need to look out for young people in our country. Among the many things this act would do, it would protect young consumers from aggressive credit card solicitations. This is in addition to dealing with interest rate increases and account changes, protecting card holders, and eliminating abusive fees and penalties. However, the particular attention to the situation facing young people is of utmost importance.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420049">I want to paint a bit of a picture of the reality that many young people in Canada and around the world face today. We know that we live in the age of constant advertising and media, whether it is the Internet, television or whatever it might be. We are constantly faced with images of consumption and advertising encouraging all people, but especially young people, to spend their money. In many cases, these things might be useful. However, in many other cases, their usefulness is questionable.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420050">The matter remains that consumption is very much an activity impressed upon young people. In recent years, we have seen the promotion that we need credit cards in order to fuel that consumption, that young people will be able to achieve what they want and be happy by buying, and that this will be easily accomplished through credit cards. Watch the music channels and listen to the radio. All of these messages are readily there and specifically promoting the use of credit cards. Having gone through a couple of universities myself, I am aware of walking down the hallways and seeing numerous credit card companies approach students to take out credit cards and enter into a proposition that for many students is difficult. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420051">Given that encouragement of consumption and the use of credit cards, we also have to see how that interacts with some of the other realities young people face. For example, many young people who are going to university or achieving post-secondary education are facing increased tuition fees. In many cases, they have to take loans out in order to pay off these tuition fees. The average Canadian student debt among those who borrow and graduate from four-year programs is $22,700, an amount that for many students who either work part-time or may not be able to work at all is quite prohibitive.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1420052">We are dealing with increased tuition fees and an overall increase in the cost of living, which for many students is highly problematic. The New Democrats have called upon the Conservative government to deal with issues of access and support when it comes to post-secondary students.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420053">I also believe it is important to protect our young people from credit card solicitation, but the abuse of credit card fees also interacts with the employment situation that many young people face. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420054">We talk a great deal about the thousands of jobs that so many Canadians have lost from coast to coast to coast. We need to recognize that, in many cases, this means not only the loss of jobs for young people, but also there are no jobs for them. I see hiring freezes and layoffs in my area. In many cases companies are laying off young people, but they also are shutting down opportunities for them when they come out of our educational institutions and look for jobs.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420055">Given the difficult employment situation that our young people face today, in addition to the constant encouragement of young people to take out credit cards and to be exposed to these difficult situations, is very unfair. We need the government to take leadership, not just looking at it in terms of protecting all consumers, but also the importance of looking ahead to the future and supporting young people in the challenges they are facing today, which in many ways differ from the challenges that other generations face.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420056">I want to particularly point out that the employment situation will continue to be very difficult for young people in that we do not know when exactly we will come out of the economic recession. We recently heard the negative forecasts. The future appears quite grim for many young people. I hear it from peers of mine from university and from college. They say that they are getting an education, and they know that is right, but what kind of opportunities are they going to have?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420057">The difficult situation faced by many of the children of members here and many young people who work in our offices, who make government and our country work, needs to be recognized. The Conservative government needs to take action. It needs to listen to the voices of the House, the leadership that New Democrats have taken. The role of government is to stand up for consumers and to protect them.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420058">I also want to note that young people are not in isolation from the reality that many of us face. Many young people are members of families and depend on them, which are equally finding themselves in very difficult situations as a result of the lack of regulation and unfair credit card rules. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420059">For example, the Canadian household debt to income ratio in 2003 increased by 105.2%, which is incredible. We note that many young people depend on their parents or their families to help them get through their education or to help them get on their feet because they do not have that ability in many cases, and especially now.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420060">It is beyond me to understand why any member would vote against something that not only stands to protect consumers, but, more important, stands to protect our young people and our future.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It is important for us to do this. With the economy in its current state and as we look for solutions to get out of this, it will require a team effort. That team effort is government and business taking responsibility. We know the banks got off scot-free in all of this. It is time for them to come to the table and produce a fair and balanced approach to its borrowing practices.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420073">I want to go back to something that is really important. Back in 2003, John Manley, the Liberal minister who was known as the minister of everything because he had received so many portfolios, came to the House of Commons. He tried to negotiate with the parties to deregulate the banking system and make it more like the American system. I remember the debate quite well.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420074">As a New Democrat, I opposed that. I give commendations to the Bloc members because they also opposed it. At the time, the Conservative Party/Alliance Party were excited about the issue and tripped over themselves to support it. If we had not stopped Mr. Manley and the Liberals, we would have had a far worse situation than we have today. Therefore, we did them a favour. We prevented the further deregulation and the creation a banking system similar to the American one. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420075">The member from Winnipeg, who sits next to me, was quite active in that campaign and did a terrific job to ensure that people understood the issue. Canadians spoke loud and clear and said that they did not want that happen to our banking institutions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420076">Today we are starting to see what is happening. Over a series of time, there has been an effective marketing campaign to encourage people to sign up for credit cards, whether it be the retailers that offer credit card interest rates of up to nearly 30%, or the banks that offer up to 20% interest rates.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420077">A number of practices are simply unfair. The credit card companies have made record profits over that time and they continue to make profits beyond the scope and pale of what people can even comprehend, because they are struggling to get by. It is time to take a reverse approach. Let companies have a profit, but it has to be fair and balanced. Let us redirect that income back into the economy as a stimulus and ensure we can settle people so they will not get further behind, which would help stimulate the economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420078">We know the banking institutions are not doing that. We know the government is not releasing some of its programs and services in an expedient way. In fact, I was looking at some of the Industry Canada announcements, going back a couple of years ago. Money has never been spent, such as money for infrastructure, for example, the border infrastructure fund. There are many more examples.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420079">One thing we could immediately do to alleviate some of the egregious attacks on consumers and their families is to put in a fair set of regulations. For example, I have a CIBC Visa card, which costs me $200 a year. There is no reason why that charge should be allowed. Two hundred dollars is quite a bit of money. On top of that, the service that one receives does not warrant that charge. At least that should be examined.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420080">The United States recognizes this. The Obama administration is moving forward with a package that is going to ensure a better sense of balance.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420081">When I talk about balance, one of the worst things right now for those who use credit cards is if they do not pay off the full balance, they get charged the interest rate on the full balance. For example, if people have a $500 credit exchange during the month and someone in their family gets sick or there is a crisis and they cannot pay back the full amount, they have to pay the interest on the full amount. That is unacceptable. It should be on the amount that is actually on the card. Once again, that would put money into the pockets of people so they could buy groceries, or pay their landlord, or pay for heating or cooling, all those different things that are important essentials.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420082">The community of <Affiliation DbId="128491" Type="2">Windsor West</Affiliation> has had an unemployment rate of 10% for a number of years, yet the government during the election said that there was nothing wrong with the economy. We understood the warnings with the threats to the auto industry ages ago, with no help or assistance from the government.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1420083">Unemployment is now at 15% and even higher given that many people have given up even looking for work. We are trying to find our way through it. The government needs to be responsible here and look at retipping the scales a bit. The credit card companies and the banks cannot have such a big advantage. Canadian taxpayers have had to buy up loans from the banks and support their systems. Taxpayer money has to be injected into the market economy because the banks will not provide that. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420084">I have a couple of examples. Even before this crisis, an auto parts supplier in the county of Essex was producing parts for the Ford Escort and selling very well and doing very well in the market, It had workers making $12 or $13 an hour, not a rich salary, and they had modest benefits. The company brought in automation. It had a good assembly rate and a good quality rate. It had problems because the banks, even before that, changed their borrowing practises on them just because they happened to be in the sector. It was not because they were bad customers or that they were looking at closing or having a problem with a particular vehicle at that time. It was because they could. The bank actually raised the company's interest rate to a point where it ate into its entire profit from what it was getting from Ford Motor Company to produce the vehicle parts. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420085">The problem is that there was nothing in there that was really productive, whereas those workers were doing what they needed to do every day. I do not think $12 or $13 an hour is a wage that one could really say is a Canadian dream. It barely lets people get by. Meanwhile, the banks were undermining that successful venture.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420086">When we look at this motion and we talk about prohibiting the unfair application of credit card payments, protecting cardholders who pay on time, limiting abusive fees and penalties, prohibiting issuers from using a consumer's card history with another creditor to raise interest rates, prohibiting issuers from charging interest on debt that has already been repaid, ensuring that cardholders are informed on the terms of their account, and protecting young consumers from aggressive credit car solicitations.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420087">Those are reasonable things to do. I would add another one that I do not believe has been addressed today, and that is the issue of privacy and security of information. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420088">For those who are not aware, the CIBC has decided to outsource its credit card processing to the United States. That means that all our credit card information is now available through the Patriot Act to the Department of Homeland Security, the CIA and the FBI. All those organizations need to do is contact that credit facility and provide that information. They are not even allowed to tell CIBC that a person's information has been taken. As well, there is no process in place as to how our personal information is used within those agencies as to whether it is dispersed or scrubbed after an investigation is done. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420089">The government, similar to the past one, has been remiss. We need to have an international treaty to protect privacy related to that and it has not done that. In fact, ironically, we have learned that even some Canadian government offices outsource some of their actual payment systems to the United States. That information once again leaves the country and becomes susceptible to the Patriot Act.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420090">I want to go back to the economy right now. It is a fair and balanced approach when we start to look at the indebtedness of Canadians and what we could do to actually stimulate the economy. When we consider household debt right now, it is quite significant. It has gone up a number of stages over the last number of years, including that 84% of people have some type of a debt.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420091">I would argue that this a very modest and responsible way to approach things. Everybody has to chip in right now to do the things that are necessary for our country to continue to exist and the middle class to flourish. The banks and credit card companies have an abysmal approach to lending practises that needs to be redirected. It is stimulus that will be good for many communities, as well as a local stimulus. We would stop a system right now that is counterproductive and, more important, is putting so many people behind at a time when they do not need to be.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

However, the motion calls for the government to introduce a bill within six months and then we would go through the whole process which could take over a year and may not even happen if we are interrupted by an election.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420094">My concern raises the point that maybe we should also be talking about the need for the government to educate the public about the scope, the magnitude and the impact of the problem. We, the consumers, also have things that we could do to mitigate the impact because it is compounding all the other problems.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420095">Maybe the starting point is to get Canadians to start thinking about the saying “credit cards should never be used for credit”. If an individual needs a credit card to get credit, that individual is accepting the high interest rates when traditional bank loan rates are much lower. If an individual does not go to a bank to finance something that is required beyond the grace period of a credit card, chances are that it means that person has bad credit and should not be getting credit in the first place.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420096">We all have responsibilities.

The Bank of Canada rate is at .25% and it has said that it will remain there for the next year. Despite that, the bank rates and credit card rates have gone up incrementally. How is that even possible? That is criminal at best and ethically it is bankrupt. We need to ensure the banks and credit card companies are accountable.

They certainly do not want to protect consumers because that would be regulation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420102">The fact is that the Conservatives have opposed proper regulation of banks from the beginning. It is in their blood. They pretend that the dodging sub-prime mortgage crisis existed only in the states. It started to happen here in Canada because the government was deregulating the mortgage market and it was caught out. Canadian taxpayers now have to underwrite $26 billion of toxic assets. Taxpayer money is now being used to backstop the banks.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420103">However, when it comes to protecting citizens who are being preyed upon and penalized through all kinds of unfair predatory practices, the government's response is to blame the individual by saying that if they had been sharper they would have been more financially literate and that if they had taken responsibility for their own lives there would not be a problem. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420104">The problem here is systemic.

I have tremendous respect for him but he could have done a little better job in terms of researching the issue that he has brought in front of the House, particularly the way the motion is worded.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420110">Part of the motion is factually incorrect. The credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 was not introduced by the Obama administration. It was introduced by Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut who is not a member of President Obama's administration. This is not that difficult to verify. The information is public and the member could have found out. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420111">For us to have credibility when we talk about issues, we need to do proper research to ensure the information provided to the House is accurate. All we are asking for on this side is accuracy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420112">Instead of proposing something tailored for Canada, I find it ironic that the NDP is supporting a motion today that is a copy of a U.S. plan. There is not a day, not even an hour when NDP members are not up speaking and comparing us to America and saying that we cannot be doing things like the Americans are doing. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420113">All of a sudden, however, they are giving credit to somebody else south of the border and applying it to the credit card system for consumers here in Canada that is not accurate and does not even reflect the Canadian experience. I am not sure why the NDP has proposed this today basing it on the American system, a system that it likes to criticize over and over again in the House. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420114">In addition to that, the Senate committee on banking is conducting a review of the credit card situation here in Canada. I can say, from being on both the finance and industry committees, that both committees have plans in the very near future to review the credit and debit card system in this country. Why would there be a motion prior to getting information from all sides of the issue at the Senate committee and at the industry and finance committees?</ParaText><ParaText id="1420115">Motions have passed in the committees and we on this side of the House have supported them. I am on both committees so I know that for a fact. A motion that passed at the finance committee was originally proposed by the Bloc member on that committee. We added to it and it became our motion. Our parliamentary secretary added some wording and broadened the study in order to allow us to look at more issues dealing with credit and debit card issues in Canada.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420116">I do not want anybody to forget that in our economic action plan, which was supported by the House, there is an indication that the finance minister will be looking at that issue. The finance minister told everyone in the House earlier this week to stay tuned because it was being worked on and it was part of the plan that was coming. Why would the NDP introduce this Americanized motion today without having all of that good information from all sides of the argument to see where we are going?</ParaText><ParaText id="1420117">What we want to do is look at what is good for Canada and Canadians and not necessarily look at what is good for Americans, which is what this motion tends to do based on the way it has been presented: that we should look at what the American motion does for the American system, which is different.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420118">Even more strange for me is that the NDP motion comes just weeks after its members voted against budget 2009 when we announced our intention to bring tough but fair new regulation on disclosure requirements for credit cards and to limit business practices that are not beneficial to consumers. What is more, we introduced the necessary legislation to allow us to proceed with these new regulations. and, as we know, the NDP voted against that.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1420119">The NDP has clearly shown itself, in my view, to be incapable of standing up for consumers in this case. The NDP members cannot claim one thing on one hand, and then in their actions do something different. I think that is a sad commentary on where we are today and why this motion does not make any sense to me and to my colleagues on the Conservative side.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420120">On the other hand, as I mentioned, our Conservative government is taking significant and decisive steps to help Canadian consumers who use credit cards, steps which my fellow Conservative, the parliamentary secretary, outlined for members earlier today. I would like to address another aspect of the strategy to help Canadian consumers who use credit cards or other financial services or products improve their financial literacy.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420121"> Witnesses appeared at the industry committee and the finance committee to talk about financial literacy. Through no fault of their own in my view, it has not been a priority for Canadians to understand how the system works. There are organizations that will help. In my riding in the fall, because we only have one more break week to be back in the riding, I have committed to organizing a public meeting strictly on financial literacy. Experts in the field of financial literacy will talk to the people of Burlington to educate them, to give them the tools they need to make proper financial decisions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420122">We are living in an increasingly complex world of financial services and products, many of which have become much more difficult for the average consumer to comprehend. Based on my experience, there are a number of financial products that have been put together over the years which many of those who sell those financial products have a hard time understanding. The range of financial products on the market or available through our local banks has been rapidly expanding, not only in availability but in complexity. This makes it difficult for the average investor to fully understand the risks or the fees that are involved. In this environment, and in light of the economic volatility we face today, strong financial literacy is not a luxury; it is an actual necessity.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420123">In the words of Toronto District School Board trustee, Josh Matlow, who is spearheading an effort to get financial literacy added to the elementary school curriculum:</ParaText><ParaText id="1420124"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The reason that we're in this economic crisis right now is that many North Americans and people around the world didn't have the economic literacy that they needed to understand how to use credit cards properly and how to read the details of mortgage contracts.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1420125">That is the issue I propose to focus on today. First, I would like to consider what financial literacy actually means.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420126">Financial literacy involves the ability to plan for one's financial future. Understanding the basics is crucial. Financial literacy is essential for people from all walks of life, including: the teenager who is setting up his or her first bank account and is trying to determine the best way to reach his or her goals; the family trying to make ends meet while saving for the family's first home; the investor trying to understand the risks and returns for his or her investments, or the benefits of compound interest; and the senior who is entering the world of Internet banking and ATMs.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420127">May I add, as we were discussing pension plans and how they work at finance committee, it is obvious that people need more education on their pension plans. A lot of people do not even look at them until after the age 50. They do not understand what their defined benefit plan is offering them or, if they do not have one, what they have to do to save.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420128">Those are the kinds of issues we need to get to, to ensure that Canadians are well versed on what is appropriate for their lifestyle and their future. Whether it is a sophisticated investment or a simple savings account, today's financial world cries out for improved financial literacy.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1420129"> Indeed, a recent survey of the Canadian Foundation for Economic Education, which has appeared before us, suggested that Canadians “feel ill-equipped to make many of the economic and financial decisions that they face in today's volatile economic climate”. The survey also showed “troubling knowledge gaps among Canadians in basic areas of economic knowledge such as credit card interest rates and filling out tax returns”.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420130">In the words of the foundation's president, Gary Rabbior, “When you have four in 10 Canadians who cannot calculate 8% on $1,000, and over 60% who do not know if their mutual funds held at financial institutions are insured, you are talking about a crisis of economic illiteracy”. Clearly, financial literacy is an essential skill that should be developed early in life. After all, a country's financial success is ultimately the sum of the financial successes of all of its households.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420131">As Laurie Campbell, executive director of Credit Counselling Canada, has noted, “Two of the most fundamental things we need to learn as young people growing up are how to raise children and how to manage money. They are the most fundamental things in life”. They are fundamental as young Canadians now have more exposure to financial dealings than ever before. They have bank accounts, debit cards, credit cards, cell phone contracts, and online banking contracts. As they enter college or university, many will have loans and perhaps the beginning of an investment portfolio.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420132">The world of finance is continually evolving and without strong financial literacy, it will be difficult for people to keep up. Without the ability to understand the financial products and services they use, consumers could wind up making unwise investment decisions or borrow well beyond their means and end up in a sea of debt.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420133">By focusing on financial literacy, we can provide people with the knowledge to help keep their heads above water. When it comes to buying a house, for example, being financially literate means one may not have all the answers but at the very least would know the questions to ask, such as: what kind of mortgage can I get, what are my repayment options, what are the fees and taxes, how can I lower my payments, and can I really afford this?</ParaText><ParaText id="1420134">Asking the right questions means understanding the true cost of borrowing. It means that knowing that the initial years of mortgage payments go toward servicing the debt, not paying down the principal.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420135"> Weak financial literacy could end up leaving people at a competitive disadvantage, unknowingly paying higher costs for basic banking transactions and short-term credit. They may face increased exposure to unregulated financial options and make themselves vulnerable to uninsured risks.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420136">On the other hand, a greater understanding of financial information and increased financial literacy can result in better consumer choices, a larger and better market for their financial sector services and greater participation in capital markets. All that could translate into higher savings levels and decreasing indebtedness, making our economy even stronger. In study after study, the evidence is clear that the more we know financially, the more likely we are to save over the long term.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420137">We have identified the issue: improving financial literacy. What about the solutions? We know the NDP does not have any, except maybe to call Senator Dodd in Connecticut to see what he is going to do with his bill. Luckily for Canadians, they have had the good sense in election after election never to have elected an NDP government federally.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420138">Our Conservative government, on the other hand, has actually come up with some made in Canada solutions, after consulting with Canadians, to encourage and foster improved financial literacy. I would like to share with the House what our government has done through the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, the FCAC.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420139"> This agency, in addition to its mandate to look at financial institutions' compliance with the consumer protection legislation and regulatory requirements, also undertakes consumer education initiatives. In doing so, it develops plain language, unbiased and educational materials on a wide range of financial products and services, which are going to be sent to the NDP offices as soon as I am done speaking. For instance, the FCAC has also developed a mortgage calculator that quickly determines mortgage payments and the potential savings resulting from prepayments, and online tools that help consumers shop for credit card and banking packages suited to them.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1420140">Since 2006, our Conservative government has provided new support for FCAC to build on its mandate. For instance, in budget 2007 we provided significant new funding for FCAC to undertake financial literacy initiatives, focusing primarily on youth, and to support the sharing of information with other financial education providers across Canada. I remind the House that this was new funding that was not supported by the NDP. Why did the NDP oppose helping financial literacy with this new funding? The funding was used to develop a free web-based interactive tool, The City, designed to help young people acquire strong financial skills and explore financial situations in a risk-free setting.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420141">We also helped jointly fund the organization of the Canadian Conference on Financial Literacy, which took place in Montreal in September 2008. This event brought together more than 260 representatives from the government and the private and voluntary sectors to discuss Canadian and international experiences in developing, delivering, measuring and evaluating financial literacy programs, products and services.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420142">We heard here the Canadian perspectives on this issue about improving financial literacy in Canada, not solely what the American senator from Connecticut wants to do in his country. However, we were not done there. We did more. In budget 2008, our Conservative government once again took steps to improve financial literacy. We provided the FCAC with $2 million in new ongoing funding to continue its work in that area and expand its research. Once again, I want to remind the House that the NDP voted against that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420143">This new funding has helped work toward the goal of significantly improving financial literacy among Canadians. For example, another free web-based interactive tool, The Money Belt, has helped provide financial information and tools to increase the basic financial knowledge of Canadians. This initiative provides an entry point to access various resources that teach the fundamentals of managing money. The Money Belt includes interactive tools on topics such as credit cards and bank accounts, combined with other financial tools.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420144">Through FCAC, our Conservative government will continue to improve the financial literacy skills of Canadians in the long term through training initiatives and community partnerships. However, we are not done. We are helping to foster better financial literacy in other key areas as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420145">Building on investments in the two previous budgets, budget 2009, our economic action plan, announced the establishment of an independent task force to make recommendations on a cohesive national strategy for financial literacy. Our task force, to be launched in the near future, will include representatives of the business and education sectors, volunteer organizations and academics that will be supported by a federal secretariat. Its conclusions will allow us to take stock of where more work is needed and make a strong contribution to ultimately empowering Canadians to make wise financial decisions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420146">Public interest groups such as Social and Enterprise Development Innovations have heralded this announcement by noting:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420147"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The government's commitment to work with all sectors to develop “a cohesive national strategy on financial literacy” is a critically important component of any long term economic recovery plan in Canada. Financial literacy is an issue that matters to all consumers of financial services including lower-income Canadians. We applaud the Canadian government for its leadership on this issue.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1420148">As my time is almost up, I will conclude by mentioning a couple of things. In addition to our commitment to financial literacy, this government is also working to introduce programs to provide incentives for families to build a responsible and secure financial future. For instance, to ensure home ownership remains an effective and affordable way to save and build equity for the future, we have put limits on new mortgages backed by a government guarantee. This includes fixing the maximum amortization period for new government-backed mortgages to 35 years and requiring a minimum down payment of 5% for those mortgages.</ParaText>

If NDP members had a sense of financial literacy they would understand, for organizations that loan money in this country, the overnight rate is not where they borrow money from the Bank of Canada. They would understand that is not what happens. They get their money, the cash that they lend out, from other organizations. The problem is global, not just in Canada.

I have to admit that I have never had any personal debt throughout my whole life. I have always operated on the positive side of the ledger. In later life when I finally obtained a credit card, I always made sure that the payments were made on time and that interest would not accrue. My wife was very diligent in ensuring that happened. I want to thank her today because her hard work in ensuring that our family remained out of debt has made it possible for me look forward to a good life in my retirement. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420175">That is the message I want to deliver to all Canadians. What we have seen in this country and the world has been an explosion of debt over the last 25 years that has driven the economies of many countries into rack and ruin, but it has also driven Canadians and other consumers throughout the world into great hardship. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420176">Yes, there are problems of financial literacy, as the hon. member from the Conservative Party pointed out, but there is a far more important issue. That is why the New Democratic Party can look south of the border now with some degree of confidence when we hear the new president of the United States and his new administration talking about new ideas to bring the American economy around. That is why we can look there and ask whether they have good ideas that we can pick up on.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420177">Does the United States have ideas within its administration or Congress that Canada can take advantage of? In fact, in some instances we are probably able to move more quickly than the United States in putting forward legislation for change, and more likely in the future to offer up solutions to the United States. With the economy that exists now in North America, we have to understand that it is very integrated.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420178">For us to take ideas from other legislators in this grand continent I do not think is inappropriate. We are going to be seeing more of that in the future from the New Democratic Party, because the President of the United States sounds more like a New Democrat than I have heard from anyone there before. There is someone in the United States who we can count on to provide us with advice. George Bush is not there anymore, whose policies and directions were totally repugnant to the New Democratic Party and to most Canadians and our supporters across the country. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420179">This is a different time and we have the opportunity to pick up new ideas. The New Democratic Party right now is the mainstream of economic reason in this country.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420180">I had the opportunity the other day to speak with John Rodriguez, who was the financial institutions critic for the New Democratic Party in the 1980s. What did he say? He said we fought long and hard against the Conservatives and the Liberals to ensure that the banks in Canada did not expand their scope beyond what needed to be; our financial institutions were kept in line. That work is playing out today.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420181">For the party opposite or the Liberals to call us, in the NDP, Luddites is nonsense. We have been standing up for Canadians' financial security in Parliament the entire time that NDP members have been here.

No, we do not. We do not need that. That is not good for Canadians. That is not going to work for Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420183">The fallacy of the extension of debt among consumers in Canada has come home to roost. It was apparent to every individual in this country. Why does the Conservative Party not recognize that the importance of these issues to consumers and to Canadians is paramount? </ParaText><ParaText id="1420184">I really want to congratulate the member for bringing this motion forward. We need to bring sense back into the lives of Canadians. We need to take the institutions that provide them with financial resources and make them understand that their job is to ensure that their customers are well protected with their financial dealings with those companies.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420185">The concept of a bank as being a secure and good place to get financial advice, to understand how to use credit and to ensure that the people who run the banks have the concern of their customers first are concepts that we have to go back to and that should drive the economy once we come out of this recession.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420186">We do not want to look back two years from now and consider that nothing was really wrong with what we were doing, that nothing was wrong with the extension of consumer debt to a point where there were no savings left in this country, there was no security for individuals in what they were doing with their money. We want to change that and move forward so that Canadians will progress, so they will gain after the downturn is over, and so they will have a new economy that will be less reliant on their personal suffering and more on a system that delivers them the resources they require, that can make their lives work and that they can afford to use in their day to day practices.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420187">To talk about consumer debt and credit cards, and to understand the nature of what is happening with this system, I think for some of us is very difficult. Of course it is, but it is not difficult to understand when someone pays his or her credit card down at the end of the month, misses $10 and ends up paying interest on the whole amount. We understand how usurious that is. It does not take a degree in economics to understand that that is not fair.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420188">That is one of the things we are working on here, to limit abusive fees and penalties, to ensure that credit cardholders understand the terms and conditions of their contracts, and that the terms and conditions of their contracts work for them as well. That is the job of the regulatory agency, the government of this country, to provide that assurance to consumers that what is offered as a basic method of payment for so many different products in this country has the terms and conditions that can work for both the consumer and the lender.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420189">What we are working with here is a good resolution. It has many parts to it. It is something that Parliament should take hold of and work for. The government cannot simply increase the font on the back of the credit card application form as its step toward ensuring the health and well-being of the financial future of Canadians. That is not good enough.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420190">We need to understand where we want to go in this country with credit.

What we are hearing is that the Conservatives are against any kind of action that might help ordinary people. That is because it is an elitist party that could not care less about real people. However, this situation is critical and we must take action. That is why the NDP moved today's motion. The purpose of this motion is to protect consumers from sudden credit card interest rate increases. This is extremely important because people are getting hit with these increases right now.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420209">We want to prohibit the unfair application of credit card payments. I will get into that later. Right now, credit card companies can charge interest on the entire credit card balance even if the cardholder has paid off nearly the entire balance in the same month. In other words, a cardholder has a $6,000 balance and pays off $5,900 of that balance. However, some credit card companies can force these ordinary people, who have been grappling with a 20-year-long economic crisis, particularly in the past year, to pay interest on the balance, even if the balance was nearly paid off. This NDP motion would prevent such practices and protect cardholders who make their payments on time. It would also protect young people. Young people are so vulnerable, yet credit card companies target them more and more because they do not have any other way to get credit.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420210">As members are aware, debt among young Canadians has reached record levels. The average student racks up close to $25,000 in debt in CEGEP, college, university or even a professional training program. Credit card companies target debt-ridden students and charge them very high interest rates, because they can make a profit and they know these people have no alternative.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420211">That is the reality at present. People are losing their jobs and cannot pay their full credit card balance. Young people are entering the job market with very high debt levels and are turning to credit cards to survive. As my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128786" Type="2">Western Arctic</Affiliation> put it so well, that is when the sharks at the credit card companies and Canada's big banks strike. These young people are paying through the nose. Today's NDP motion is designed to put a stop to these practices as soon as possible, because these people cannot wait any longer.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420212">This crisis has been going on for 20 years. Family incomes have dropped in nearly all categories, except for the wealthiest Canadians. Family incomes have gone down across the country for the middle class, the lower middle class and the poorest members of our society. People earn less today than they did 10, 15 or 20 years ago. This is a crisis we could see coming. The only people who have benefited from the elitist economic policies of the Liberals and now the Conservatives—nothing has changed—are the rich, who are now earning the lion's share of family income in Canada.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1420213">Those are the crises we could see coming, but there is also another that is very much present and clear at this time. Record numbers of workers are losing their jobs. For some months now, hundreds of thousands of jobs are being lost. In my province of British Columbia, more than 100,000 jobs have been lost. Unfortunately, we hold the Canadian unemployment record, thanks to the policies of Gordon Campbell.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420214">People not only have lower family incomes than they did 10, 15 or 20 years ago, but they are losing their jobs altogether. They end up in a terrible situation. What happens then? We have seen it, and my NDP colleagues have been talking about it all day. The credit card companies raise their interest rates for people who are unable to pay off their balance. So they end up with a debt. It is not their fault that, having lost their jobs, they are trying to survive, feed their children, keep a roof over their heads. They have lost everything and they fall a bit behind in their payments to credit companies, and then these companies hike up the interest rate to punish them. We have given one example: last fall, Visa raised its interest rate from 19% to nearly 25%, and that is calculated with charges as well. Normally, imposing such rates on people who have lost their jobs and cannot pay their balance in full ought not to be allowed; 25% interest plus all the other related charges. That is shocking. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420215">So then what? We see it happening. The major Canadian banks are making profits as never before. The Bank of Montreal reports $560 million for the third quarter of 2008. The economy is in crisis and the banks and credit card companies are making record profits at the expense of ordinary people. This is unacceptable.

He said that the Conservatives are on the side of the CEOs of banks and corporations and that somehow, magically, there will be some kind of trickle down effect.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420218">The fact that we are looking at record profits, the fact that we are looking at gouging on a monumental level, does not concern the Conservatives. It did not concern the Liberals beforehand. That essentially is what distinguishes us from them. That is why we have a key role in the House. The moment an election is over the Conservatives turn their backs on ordinary people. We saw that under the Liberal regime as well. The Liberals turned their backs on ordinary Canadians. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420219">What we have seen over the last 20 years is a complete and utter collapse of family incomes in almost all income categories. Real income has fallen for 80% of Canadians. The top 20% have been well served by Liberal and Conservative economic policies. There is no doubt about that. They now take most of the income in Canada. Not a single Liberal or a single Conservative has stood up in the House and said that is fundamentally wrong. </ParaText>

We sign bad trade deals without any support for value-added exports, and Liberals and Conservatives vote for them.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420221">The economic elites, the Liberals and the Conservatives, have told the credit card companies that they can gouge away.

I have a letter from the Canadian Federation of Independent Business which states:</ParaText><ParaText id="1420241"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">On behalf of 105,000 small- and medium-sized independent business owners that are members of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB), I am asking for your help to bring greater transparency and accountability to the credit card industry and to stop Visa and MasterCard from instituting large, unjustified rate hikes on merchant fees.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420242">I have heard from businesses in my community. Perhaps the member for <Affiliation DbId="128505" Type="2">Burnaby—New Westminster</Affiliation> would consider them to be the corporate elite. He is very free with his ideological and, I think, quite divisive language. However, having come from the small- and medium-size business sector myself, these are corporations, people providing value, working hard in their communities, who are trying to make ends meet as well. Their livelihoods are being threatened, particularly if the fees on debit cards go up the way it is being projected. That could put some in the small business community out of business.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420243">I also have a letter from the Retail Council of Canada expressing concern about the fees that are charged to businesses by the credit card companies and the banks. In Canada the fee of 2% is more than double the fees that are charged to the businesses and the retail community in the U.K., more than twice of those in Sweden, and four times what is charged in Australia. There appears to be an unaccountability in this industry. That is what the motion is intended to address.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420244">The motion refers to tough economic times. That certainly is the challenge Canada is facing, along with other countries in the world. B.C. has lost a total of 69,000 jobs since October, and 73,000 jobs over the past 12 months. Unemployment among young people is at almost 15% now. Some 23,000 people in B.C. joined the ranks of the unemployed in March 2009. That number continues to increase.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420245">We have a very severe economic situation in this country. Personal bankruptcies are up. These are not just terms. These are people who have invested their working lives in their small businesses and are finding that investment wiped out in this tough economic situation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420246">Canadians are losing their jobs, as I mentioned, and 1.4 million Canadians are waiting in the unemployment lines at this point. We do have a serious economic situation which makes me wonder why the NDP, which understood the severity of this economic situation, rejected the 2009 budget with its stimulus package before even seeing it. If the NDP is as concerned as the member was claiming, it is surprising that NDP members took a stand to slow down and block stimulus.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420247">What is actually even more distressing is the absence of understanding of this tough economic climate by the Conservative Party, which is frequently referred to as the party of the rich elite. The Conservatives were very much asleep at the switch when it came to the economy. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1420248">Last fall, it was an absolutely woeful performance of denying that Canada would face this recession, failing to take action, encouraging Canadians to buy stocks just when they were about to take their deepest plunge and coming forward with an absolutely insulting economic update that did nothing for Canadians but instead took shots at women and civil servants. The Conservative government has a very poor record on the economy and does not appear to be taking any action on this important economic issue as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420249">In response to an earlier question, the parliamentary secretary described his concerns about over-regulating Canadians. I agree that we do not want to over-regulate but using that as an excuse for inaction on this important issue is completely unacceptable. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420250">On the other hand, the Liberals called for early action, foresaw the meltdown as early warning stages were coming, called for action and stimulus last September and have had an ongoing awareness and response to this situation, including the issue of the banks and credit cards.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420251">We support this motion because it gets the conversation going and builds on work that the Liberal Party has already been implementing in Parliament and in Senate committees. We are supporting the intent of the motion, not the motion word for word. We believe action is needed but it must be thoughtful action. The Liberals believe that strong regulation and legislation may be needed. This motion causes us to work toward that. When to regulate is always a key issue in a situation like this. Regulation is needed in legislation when there is a market failure. When the markets are functioning well, it is not a time for government to get involved, take sides and hamper a well functioning market.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420252">Is the market functioning properly in this situation? No, I believe there is a market failure. There are some very large players who are in a business structure that one could call a platform, where the credit card companies and banks are a platform between buyers and suppliers of goods. They facilitate that trade of goods and services. However, when one has an oligopoly structure like this, there can be too much power in the hands of the oligopoly firms. If that is not regulated properly, they can take advantage of their position.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420253">This is a complex issue. The government is not providing leadership. It tends to focus on simplistic, politically popular issues in order to gain votes but it is not so great on tackling difficult and challenging public policy issues. This is an important one. I talked a bit about the small business sector, but the way cards are marketed to young people is another classic failure of our market system. It is a failure that is classically called information asymmetry, where the credit cards and bank purveyors of credit have a lot more information about what this will cost the young people in terms of interest rates and what will happen if they do not pay their card down fully and on time.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420254">Shortly after my daughter came out of high school, she was sent letters offering credit cards. Young people, who may be 17, 18 or 19, do not have the information as to what it might cost them in the long term and how it may make them dependent on this culture of borrowing to buy what we want. That is not useful for our society and it is certainly worth taking a strong look at.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420255">Elected representatives need to work together on this. The Conservative government, which is on probation so that it can be more effective and accountable, has been taking no apparent action on this issue. It should get with the program and support this motion.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The motion has some very key components, to which other members have spoken, but I suggest that some of it does not really pertain to the Canadian environment, especially the mention of the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009, American legislation that does not pertain to Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420266">As members well know, the Canadian banks and financial institutions that control much of the credit card fees, et cetera, have been pretty stable in Canada because the Liberal government set out in 2001 to ensure that there were strong regulations and that we had good control. Had it not been for the Liberal government of the day ensuring that we had good control and good regulation of financial institutions, we might have had the same problems that we see in the United States and in other parts of the world.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420267">We do have some pretty good regulations in place that are making banks accountable. We have credit card databases and profiles of clients and credit cards to look at how the system is working and how people are accessing credit. At the same time, while this is not particularly pertinent to the solution, the ideas that are being brought forward by the motion are worth thinking about. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420268">One of the things most heinous that we see today is that many Canadians are in debt. In my part of the world, in Vancouver, British Columbia, buying a small 1,000 square foot condominium is enough to crush a small family. We have young families with university and college educations who are making what, at one time, people used to consider a reasonable income, both making say $70,000 or $80,000 each. A couple with a small child who buys a $500,000 condominium in my riding will not be able to afford to pay the mortgage if one of them loses their job.

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Fry" id="2716415"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128515" Type="2">Hon. Hedy Fry (Vancouver Centre, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1420540">Mr. Speaker, before question period, I talked about supporting the intent of this motion but felt that some of the ways of implementing the objective in the motion were impractical, one of which, as I mentioned, has to do with the United States legislation, which does not pertain to Canada as we have different legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420541">I also went on to point out that we had gone a long way when the Liberal government was here in 2001. We secured financial institutions, looked at regulations and set up the credit card database in which we have a large amount of data that has prevented us from going the way that the United States and other countries did. It was because we had secured our financial institutions. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420542">The motion also talks about the aggressive targeting mechanisms used by credit card companies to ensure young people have credit cards. They offer them low interest rates to hook them in and then, when they get these young people in, they raise the interest rates, which is why so many people are now indebted.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420543">As I said earlier on, we talk about the indebtedness of people and we need to do something about it. This is one of the reasons the Liberals took a leadership role in the Senate. We wanted the Senate banking committee to look at some of these issues and to aggressively look at solutions. The problem is real. The debt of most Canadians at this time, especially consumers, is huge. In my riding of Vancouver Centre, the cost of homes and everything else is so high. We have young couples in their thirties who are university educated. Some have MBAs and some are lawyers. Together, these couples are making a reasonable income but they cannot afford to buy a home. They have stretched themselves to the extent that they can but when one of them loses a job in this climate, they are within two pay cheques of bankruptcy. We need to be concerned about these people who also have large credit card debts that they need to pay.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420544">Many of my colleagues have made the point that many retailers right now are in a credit crunch. This is all a vicious cycle. We know that when people are indebted they are not spending. They are hoarding and saving. They are indebted to credit cards companies. They have reached their maximum limits and therefore cannot go outand buy. The retail sector is suffering because of the inability of consumers to spend money on anything that is not basic. Shops, retailers and small businesses are hurting a great deal by this recession. They have their own credit crunch to deal with.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420545">On top of that, the credit card companies are charging the retailers 11% and 12% interest rates, which does not allow the retailers to make a profit. Many of them are trying to bring about sales so they can encourage people to buy but they cannot do that and stay in business if they do not make a profit. They now have a choice. They either go out of business or they bring down their funds. However, if they do not make a profit, they will go out of business at the end of the day. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420546">The financial institutions, which govern much of the credit card debts and the interest rates charged by credit card companies, need to show a sense of responsibility by making the credit card companies understand that by charging high interest rates and changing interest rates without enough notice to people who cannot afford to pay off their full balance, which will only increase now when people are counting their pennies and can only afford to pay the minimum amount, they are creating a huge problem. People's indebtedness will hurt this economy and any economic stimulus package or any development that we try to make to turn the corner.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420547">This is a vicious cycle that we see happening, one that is creating a worsening situation all the time.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420548">Now we know that typical of the Conservative government is a promise that it will do something about it. The <Affiliation DbId="128634" Type="2">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> said that he would go off and deal with the credit card companies and get them to do these things voluntarily. However, when they told him to take a hike, nothing happened. We continue to see promises made in stimulus packages, in budgets, in all of these declarations by a government that never actually come to fruition. Nothing happens. Talk is cheap. </ParaText>

We have put the government on probation because at some point in time we need to find out whether it is just talk. We need to see the money flowing. We need to see the work being done to get the credit card companies to look at the problems. We need to see that the promises to spend money in certain places comes to fruition. We need all this shovel-ready stuff to occur. We need long term investments.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420551"> Those are some of the things that we are looking to the government to actually make good on and we are keeping our eye on the government on that basis. However, at the same time, we do not wish to be irresponsible.

When I say studies, I do not mean studies in the manner in which the government speaks of studies, which is some kind of two year plan to do something that never comes to fruition.

In 1990 the New Democrats said that the credit card companies were ripping off regular Canadians, consumers and small businesses. A study done by the standing committee in 1990 recommended that we cap the interest rates to 8% above prime. No action has been taken all these years.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420569">The credit card companies are continuing to rip off young and old Canadians and businesses, big and small. There are 11 ways they do it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420570">Rip-off one is the interest rate offered by bank issued credit cards goes to about 19.9%, almost 20%, even though the Bank of Canada interest rate is extremely low. The interest rate is going down, yet the credit card rates are going up. The interest rate offered by retailer-issued credit cards is even worse. If people go to the Government of Canada website and choose a credit card, they will see the interest rates offered by these companies range from 24% to 28.8%, almost 29% interest.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420571">Rip-off two is the consumer pays interest not on the current balance, but on the previous month's balance. For example, people who owe $1,000 and pay off $800 of that might think they will pay interest on the remaining $200. That is not the case. They pay the interest on the entire $1,000. I cannot believe our country allows this kind of ripoff? It is not a person's current balance; it is what the person owed last month.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420572">Rip-off three is this. Recently Canadian Tire Corporation notified many of its cardholders that the annual interest rate on late payment fees would rise to 19.5%. Some cardholders know about this, but others do not. It does not even tell people what its interest rate is. It just jacks it up.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420573">Rip-off four is the credit card companies send people a contract to sign. In the contract, in really small, fine print, probably 5 point, 6 point print, is language that is very difficult to understand. Sometimes they do not even tell people, so the customers really do not understand the implications.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420574">Rip-off five is credit card company representatives go to universities and entice young people by showing them big ads and getting them to pick these credit cards. Then they are living off debt. The reason why a lot of young students end up having many credit cards is because they have huge student debts, on average about $30,000 per student. Then they get hooked on these credit cards by aggressive marketing targeted toward them.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420575">Rip-off six is credit card companies also go after the seniors. They send them cards for which they never asked. Recent pollings show that one in five Canadians receive cards without asking for them. First, the credit card companies offer short-term lower rates to hook them in. Then they change the rates without telling them. They apply it to different accounts. It looks like there is a saving in the beginning, but then the longer term, or in the fine print in the signed contract, which seniors cannot read, when the first purchase is made, they find that the rates are applied differently within their accounts.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="30">(1530)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1420576">Rip-off seven is even cardholders who pay on time are subjected to penalties, rising interest rates, annual monthly service charges. Even if they do everything they are asked to do, the companies still go after them.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420577">Rip-off eight is the overseas transactions. People might not know that when they go across the border to buy something in Buffalo, for example, a 2.5% charge on top of the 19% or the 28% charged is applied.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420578">Rip-off nine is the interchange fees to merchants. Many small businesses are saying this is grossly unfair. Credit companies charge up to 4% on the total price of the sales rather than a flat transaction fee. Again, that is completely unfair.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420579">Rip-off 10 is the increased annual fees while the service decreases. When the service goes down, the annual fees go up.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420580">Rip-off 11 is the penalties for exceeding the credit limit. There is a charge on that also.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420581">It is no wonder that last year eight out of ten Canadians, or 84%, reported having some kind of debt. They say they are worried that they are unable to deal with unexpected events. Household debt is at an all-time high, reaching one trillion dollars two years ago. Last year there was a record debt load averaging $80,000 per household, including mortgage debt. Canadians, especially middle-income, have racked up a huge amount of debt. It has doubled since about 1990. What are the consequences? Bankruptcies are now rising 14.9% year over year.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420582">The motion of the New Democrats says that we want to protect consumers from interest rate increases and account changes. We want to prohibit unfair application of card payments. We want to protect cardholders who pay on time. We want to limit abusive fees and penalties. We want to prohibit issuers from using a consumer's card history with another creditor to raise interest rates. We want to prohibit issuers from charging interest on debt that has already been repaid. We want to ensure that cardholders are informed of the terms of the account. We want to protect young consumers from aggressive credit card solicitations.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420583">This is the kind of common sense approach that the New Democrats call on the government to introduce within six months, comprehensive legislation, no more talk, no more studies. Let us ensure that we implement a credit card accountability, responsibility and disclosure act, similar to what the Obama administration is doing.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420584">The Liberals have talked and talked and studied. There is another study in the Senate. What do the Conservatives do? They just talk to the banks and do nothing.

This problem has existed for many decades and we have seen it get worse with each passing year. Consumer debt has risen dramatically in Canada over the past decades, and it remains today at an all-time high.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420601">The current economic crisis has compounded the difficulties that this high-level of consumer debt makes for ordinary Canadians. Many Canadians are facing a loss of income because of layoffs and unemployment and the lack of availability of employment insurance in their area. They often have to resort to credit cards to make what income they have stretch and to find immediate access to some money to pay their everyday household bills. They use them as a stopgap, which only serves to increase the pressure and the difficulties that these families face. We know it is a serious and stressful time for many families.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420602">Yet we still see increases in credit card rates across the country from different providers. These credit card rates continue to increase at a time when the Bank of Canada rate is at an all-time low. There seems to be no willingness on the part of banks and credit card companies to pass on to consumers the benefits of that low Bank of Canada rate.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420603">This is not something that has just needed to be done now. For many decades we have needed this kind of intervention to protect consumers. We are glad that we have this opportunity today to debate some very specific suggestions for addressing the problems that consumers are facing with regard to credit card interest rates.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420604">One of the things our motion talks about is modelling a response in Canada on what is currently being debated in the United States. Right now I believe both the Senate and the House in the United States are looking at measures to protect consumers from credit card interest rate gouging in that country. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420605">I have looked at one particular piece of legislation, the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, which is currently before the U.S. Senate. This is the legislation that the motion we are talking about today refers to as a potential model for the government, a model that might enable it to get on with this task more quickly than it might otherwise do.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420606">The government has talked about studying the issue. It has talked about a task force. Here is a legislative model currently being debated in the United States, put forward by the Obama administration, that merits the government's attention and might provide a quick start to getting something before the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420607">The motion talks about a six-month deadline for legislation. We would love to see it faster than that. If the government could get it sooner, that would be great, and perhaps looking at what is being proposed in the American Senate would allow it to get on with that task.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420608">I want to talk about what specifically is in the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act that is before the United States Senate right now.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420609"> Section 101 of that legislation would require prior notice of interest rate increases on credit cards. It would prohibit an increase without 45 days' notice. It would prohibit applying rate increases retroactively to existing balances, and it would require clear notice of the right to cancel the credit card when an interest rate is raised. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420610">These are important initiatives in the United States. In a few of these cases, I should note, we have similar regulations already in Canada. In some cases we have a partial regulation similar to what is being considered in the bill before the United States Senate, but overall, the comprehensiveness of the legislation merits our attention here.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420611">Section 102 of the U.S. bill talks about a freeze on interest rate terms and fees on cancelled cards. That would prevent the interest rate from being raised or repayment terms being cancelled if a cardholder cancels the card.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420612">Section 103 talks about limits on fees and interest charges, and there are four provisions under this section. It would prohibit double-cycle billing. That prohibits credit card issuers from imposing interest charges on any portion of a balance that is paid by the due date.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1420613">It talks about over-limit fee restrictions, where cardholders must be given the option of having a fixed credit limit that cannot be exceeded, and card companies cannot charge over-limit fees on cardholders with fixed limits. Cardholders may elect to prohibit the creditor from completing over-limit transactions that will result in a fee or constitute a default under the credit agreement. Over-limit charges can only be charged when an extension of credit other than the fee or interest charge causes the credit limit to be exceeded. Over-limit charges can only be applied once during a billing cycle.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420614">The American legislation would also prohibit charging interest on fees, such as credit card transaction fees, late fees and over-limit fees. It would also put limits on charging certain fees, for instance, to allow a cardholder to pay a credit card debt, whether the payment is by mail, telephone, electronic transfer or otherwise. It requires fees to be reasonably related to cost. Foreign currency exchange fees may only be imposed in an account transaction if the fee reasonably reflects cost incurred by the creditor and the creditor publicly discloses the method for calculating the fee.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420615">Section 104 of the U.S. legislation talks about the consumer's right to reject a card before notice is provided of an open account. It gives cardholders who get pre-approved the right to reject a card up until they activate it, without having their credit adversely affected.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420616">Section 105 clarifies the terms used, because often there is confusion between the terms “fixed rate” and “prime rate”. It would go to establishing a single definition.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420617">Section 106 talks about the application of card payments. It prohibits card companies from setting early deadlines for credit card payments. It requires payments to be applied first to the credit card balance with the highest rate of interest, to minimize financial charges. It prohibits late fees if the card issuer delayed crediting the payment. It prohibits card companies from charging late fees when a cardholder presents proof of mailing a payment within seven days of the due date.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420618">Section 107 talks about the length of the billing period, required to be 21 days before the bill is due.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420619">Section 108 is an important section of the American legislation. It talks about a prohibition on universal default and unilateral changes to cardholder agreements. This is something we could use in Canada to prevent credit card issuers from increasing interest rates on a cardholder in good standing for reasons unrelated to the cardholder's behaviour with respect to that particular card. It prevents credit card issuers from changing the terms of a credit card contract for the length of the card agreement. It also requires issuers to lower after six months the penalty rates that have been imposed on a cardholder, if the cardholder commits no further violations. These are all things that go a considerable way to protecting consumers.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420620">Section 109 talks about enhanced penalties.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420621">Section 110 talks about enhanced oversight of credit card issuers through their primary regulator, something that is also very important.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420622">The bill has other sections that are very important. There is a whole section dealing with the protection of young consumers and the extension of credit to young people and to underage consumers, restrictions on affinity cards that are provided to young people, and protection of young consumers from pre-screened offers of credit. There would have to be permission given to allow for that pre-screening.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420623">In Canada, we have seen occasions where young people have been particularly targeted, like seniors, by credit card companies and often provided with credit cards that were not requested. This has often contributed to the debt problems that those groups face in our society.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420624">The American legislation also talks about interchange fees. While it does not go to providing specific remedies for the problems faced there, it does call for a study and report on interchange fees.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420625"> While the motion we are talking about today does not talk about interchange fees, those fees that are charged to retailers and merchants for using a credit card service and ultimately have to be passed on to consumers, this is something that is very important.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420626">We have heard from many retailers. I have heard from them in my riding. One retailer pointed out that $4.5 billion was taken in, in those kinds of fees, last year. In his business, the rate he had to pay the credit card company for using credit card services was raised eight times before October of last year. This is unacceptable. This is another hidden cost that gets passed on to consumers. It is also unfair to merchants.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420627"> We need comprehensive credit card legislation in Canada to prevent gouging of our consumers, of people who rely on these devices. We also need comprehensive legislation to protect retailers who also need these credit cards as a requirement of doing business here in Canada.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It is unfortunate that the Conservative member for <Affiliation DbId="128235" Type="2">Burlington</Affiliation> indicated that the motion makes no sense to him or any of the Conservative members and they will not support it. It seems to me that when there is a problem, one of the first productive steps one can do is to admit there is a problem. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420629">The fees charged to merchants for services raises another issue that concerns me. The first thing some of the consultants who deal with people in debt crisis do is cut up the credit cards. It means those people have to deal in cash. Even people who deal in cash have to pay those hidden fees, because they are passed on by the retailer.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420630">I wonder if the member has a comment on whether or not, in a period of responsible financial literacy and activity, consideration might be given to prohibiting the banks from not allowing retailers to give cash discounts when they make those purchases?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

He said the Conservatives have been saying they do not understand the motion and they do not understand its importance.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420632">We also saw during question period the <Affiliation DbId="128843" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance</Affiliation> dismiss this whole issue very cavalierly, actually. He said that it was a small issue, that there were bigger issues, and that the minister was attending to bigger issues than this one. I would like the parliamentary secretary to say that to the families who are dealing with the debt crisis in their own families, who are dealing with the issues of paying the bills when they have been laid off and cannot collect EI, or when they are on EI and there is not a hope for a job in their community.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420633">This is not a small issue when we talk to Canadians who have been paying through the nose for the availability of this kind of credit and this kind of service. It is not a side issue or something that can be ignored, but it has been ignored for far too long. It has been far too long since we have had a government that has been willing to take on the banks directly on this issue and tell them they have gone too far and they continue to go too far, to tell the major retailers that their credit card services are going too far and their interest rates are far too high. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420634">We need a government with the courage of that conviction, the courage to stand up for ordinary Canadians and say that this gouging has to stop and it has to stop now and that we will not put it off any longer. We have not had that to date in this country.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420635">When we raised the issue of ATM fees, where consumers have to pay to take their own money out of a bank, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> said he would write the banks a letter or talk to them. Nothing was ever really resolved about that issue.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420636">These corporations and banks are raking in huge profits on the backs of Canadians. We are not saying there should not be a fee for services offered, but we are saying it needs to be reasonable. We are not saying that credit should not come with an interest rate, but we are saying that should be a reasonable rate and that it should be regulated and carefully monitored so that consumers have a modicum of protection when it comes to using this kind of service.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Banks are large institutions. They are extremely profitable and the entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well in those banks. I believe that banks will find ways to make money to keep themselves and their shareholders happy. I do not believe that these measures to reasonably protect Canadians would do damage to the banks in Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420639">I think it is time we had governments and parliamentarians who are willing to stand on the side of ordinary people against this kind of gouging, against these outrageous interest rates, and make sure that there is protection available to those consumers.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Rajotte" id="2716730"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128282" Type="2">Mr. James Rajotte (Edmonton—Leduc, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1420640">Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to address the House on the motion put forward by the NDP with respect to credit cards, credit card rates and debit cards.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420641">First of all, I think it is important to clarify, and I asked this question of a member of the NDP, as to where this idea is coming from in terms of the United States. The motion references the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 and that this was introduced by the Obama administration in the United States, but this in fact is untrue. It was not introduced by the Obama administration. The act was introduced by a senator from Connecticut, Christopher Dodd, who some members will know ran against President Obama during the Democratic primary. He is the chair of the Senate banking committee in the United States, but he is not a member of the Obama administration. I would wonder why the members of the NDP would allow an error like that to be so prominent in their motion.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420642">Second, another concern I have with the motion is it disregards hearings which members of three committees--two committees of the House of Commons and one committee in the Senate--actually voted to hold in their respective committees to investigate this issue, because it is a very complicated issue. The finance committee, the committee which I gladly chair, and the industry committee have passed motions to look at this issue. I suspect we will have hearings on this in May. The Senate committee is actually examining this issue at this time. It makes me wonder why the NDP would not wait another four weeks until the conclusion of those hearings and then pass judgment on what needs to be done in terms of a series of recommendations.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420643">With respect to credit cards and debit cards, these issues, in fairness, have garnered considerable attention in recent weeks. They certainly have been raised with me by many constituents and by many organizations that are valuable in terms of representing their membership, such as the Retail Council of Canada, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, and the Canadian Restaurant and Foodservices Association. They have raised these concerns on behalf of their members, which is why the three committees have voted to study the issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420644">The finance committee, as I mentioned, will be studying it very shortly. I know, as the Conservative members voted to study this issue, the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> will be paying close attention and will obviously want to hear from all parliamentarians on this issue after they have studied it in depth.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420645">I also want to point out that our Conservative government has already taken and is in the process of taking some very significant measures to protect credit card users which we have outlined in the budget, our economic action plan, which I would note that members of the NDP in fact voted against.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420646">Our government has strongly advocated that consumers are best served when there is maximum disclosure, when there is competition and when there is choice. On the first point, our budget 2009 economic action plan seeks improvements in areas such as the provision of clear and simple summary information on credit contracts and credit card application forms. We also served notice that we intend to limit business practices that are not beneficial to consumers. For example, we will be seeking improvements in debt collection practices of federally regulated financial institutions and moving forward to require a minimum grace period on new purchases made with credit cards.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420647">Early reaction to these measures has been very favourable. In fact at the finance committee we heard from groups, such as the Public Interest Advocacy Centre, which remarked, “Certainly our reaction to the fact that the government is moving in this direction is a positive one”. We have also heard encouraging words from the Retail Council of Canada, which supported some measures in budget 2009 saying, “These steps help to protect retailers and customers from the unfair practices of credit card companies and their issuing banks”.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420648">Despite the NDP's opposition to these measures, with the support of the official opposition, the budget passed and now our government has the authority to draft regulations for the protection of Canadian consumers. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420649">As the House of Commons well knows, the credit card market is a private sector market and credit card interest rates and features are made by the credit card issuers in a very competitive environment. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="00">(1600)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1420650">Currently in Canada, financial institutions offer consumers a wide variety of choice. There are more than 200 credit cards available in Canada with widely varying interest rates. This means there is a great deal of competition and there is currently plenty of choice.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420651">As the Toronto <I>Star</I> has noted, there is an array of cards on the market, including some 60 low-rate ones. Consumers have the freedom to and should shop around for the best option and rate for their individual needs. While having so many choices ensures competition and varying interest rates, decisions about which card is best can be tricky and difficult without the necessary knowledge.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420652">Indeed, all consumers can benefit by increasing their understanding of interest rates and the effects of compound interest, a lesson I learned very painfully as a young man. In that respect, the federal government has a role to play by helping ensure Canadians are fully informed of their options. This raises the important issue of financial literacy, something that our government is addressing. I must compliment the <Affiliation DbId="128843" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance</Affiliation> for raising it in committee and asking us to look into it, which we are doing within our current study. As well, the finance minister was in the United States this week addressing an international forum on this issue.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420653">Through our support for the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, our government has helped consumers make informed credit card choices. I would note that our Conservative government has increased funding for this agency in both budget 2007 and budget 2008 to help Canadians make informed financial decisions on products like credit cards as part of our efforts to improve financial literacy. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420654">I would encourage all members of the House to check the information put out by the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada. Representatives appeared before the committee and they are very willing to work with members of Parliament and Canadians across the country in terms of making Canadians more informed and financially literate.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420655">While the agency's mandate is primarily to ensure federally regulated financial institutions provide the required disclosure to consumers, it also provides consumers with very useful information, such as comparison tables outlining the rates and features of the many credit cards offered today in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420656">Measures in our economic action plan will bring about improvements, such as the provision of clear and simple summary information on credit contracts and credit card application forms. That was raised in the debate this afternoon. It is a valid point, but we are in fact addressing that through the economic action plan.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420657">Increasing consumer protection in this manner, along with the kind of information available on the FCAC website, will help those who use credit cards or who are considering applying for one. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420658">FCAC also publishes a semi-annual report, “Credit Cards and You”, which provides comparison tables outlining the rates and features of numerous credit cards offered in Canada by a variety of issuers. I would encourage all Canadians interested in obtaining this report or others to call 1-866-461-3222 or visit www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca. There is nothing that could do as much in terms of improving or addressing the situation as making sure consumers are as literate as possible on financial issues. I would encourage all members of Parliament to do so as well. All of FCAC's publications are available at no charge.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420659">Young Canadians especially will benefit from these actions that we are taking and the information available as they decide for the first time what credit cards and other financial products are best for them. That is why our Conservative government is very serious about protecting consumers and their dealings with financial institutions.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420660">Financial literacy has been a priority for us. It is an area where we have made significant progress since coming to office in 2006. We understand that one's own level of financial literacy very often influences one's choices, whether one is selecting credit cards, buying a house or deciding on a career. That is why, as we announced in budget 2009, we have pledged within the coming months to establish an independent task force that will make recommendations to the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> on a cohesive national strategy on financial literacy. The task force will include representatives of the business and education sectors, volunteer organizations and academics, and will be supported by a federal secretariat.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1420661">What is more, we will work with the provinces, the private sector and community organizations to improve the financial literacy of all Canadians. I would note that this announcement has been tremendously well received. The investor education fund applauds this particular development. The Canadian Foundation for Economic Education, which also appeared before our committee on this issue, proclaimed that it commends the government for this very specific task force.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420662">However, there are other concrete examples of our government taking steps to help inform consumers. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420663">Building on measures announced in the summer of 2008, we are moving forward to make mortgage insurance more transparent, understandable and affordable. This will include enhanced disclosures to consumers about the characteristics of mortgage insurance. While lenders are already required to itemize the cost of mortgage insurance as part of their disclosure to borrowers, the new measure will set out additional mandated disclosures to help consumers better understand the mortgage insurance transaction.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420664">Our government will also propose new measures to ensure that Canadian consumers are charged no more for mortgage insurance and the true cost of obtaining that insurance. That is why columnists such as <I>The Globe and Mail</I> financial columnist, Boyd Erman, has claimed that the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">finance minister</Affiliation> “can rightly roll out a new slogan - friend of the Canadian home buyer”. The minister can say it loud. He is a friend of the Canadian homebuyer.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420665">Despite the fact that our efforts have been opposed on these measures at almost every turn by the NDP, our Conservative government will continue to ensure that our financial system stays competitive and that consumers are in fact protected. Based on our prior actions, it is clear that we are serious about protecting consumers in their dealings with financial institutions and will continue to remain vigilant in ensuring that our financial system stays competitive and that consumers receive the highest possible standard of service.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420666">What we must also do here is recognize that our financial institutions are the strongest in the world for many reasons. I do not think it behooves any of us to take shots at them from the sidelines for unnecessary reasons. We investigate where there is an investigation, but we should recognize that they are recognized by many as the strongest in the world and we should celebrate that fact.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420667">We owe it to Canadians in fact to keep our model financial system strong. Canada's financial system is stable. It is well capitalized and it is underpinned by one of the most effective regulatory frameworks in the world.</ParaText>

							</ParaText><ParaText id="1420670">Further to that, a recent article in Ireland's largest daily paper, <I>The Independent</I>, recently heralded that the Canadian system has won praise worldwide. The World Economic Forum has also declared Canadian banks the soundest in the world. The Canadian system is undoubtedly an excellent model.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420671">We could also listen to a recent commentary on the global recession by the BBC's well respected economics editor, Stephanie Flanders of the U.K.:</ParaText><ParaText id="1420672"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Nowhere is immune, but by most key measures, the Canadians are coming out of this crisis in a league of their own.

							<ParaText id="1420673">I know it may be hard for a Conservative to convince NDP members, but they seem to be accepting everything that President Obama says, so let us quote President Obama on this issue:</ParaText><ParaText id="1420674"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">--one of the things that I think has been striking about Canada is that in the midst of this enormous economic crisis, I think Canada has shown itself to be a pretty good manager of the financial system in the economy in ways that we haven't always been here in the United States.

The measures we have taken, such as on the mortgage purchase program, have all been done at commercially exchanged rates. That in fact will prove to be a benefit to the Government of Canada in terms of revenues, but it does help the banking system in terms of allowing it more liquidity, which obviously helps Canadian consumers and businesses across the country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420677">Over a year and a half into the global liquidity crisis, Canada's banks and other financial institutions remain sound, well capitalized and less leveraged than their international peers, all of which reflect a rigorous regulatory regime. It is important to know that the regime we have currently in place in Canada has been a very effective one.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1420678">However, a made in Canada approach explains this, one where capital requirements for regulated financial institutions are above minimum international standards and higher than other jurisdictions. However, we cannot and will not rest on our laurels, considerable as they may be.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420679">In terms of regulation, that is why we on this side of the House are proposing a common securities regulator, which we certainly hope the official opposition will support. We know that the Bloc is unfortunately opposing this and it seem as though the NDP is opposing this. My understanding was that in years past they did support this, but they have now apparently changed their position and will not be supporting this.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420680">This is an additional measure to ensure that proper actions are taken. We will have an effective enforcement mechanism in place, but we will also be able to allow companies to raise capital across Canada without dealing with a whole stable of securities regulation that is different in different provinces. We will be able to raise capital across this country in a much more uniform way.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420681">That is why our economic action plan enhanced the government's flexibility and responsiveness to support financial institutions and the financial system in the event of extraordinary circumstances, measures consistent with our G7 and G20 commitments. Our government knows that Canadians are very concerned about access to credit in general, whether it be through credit cards, mortgages or other credit products.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420682">As part of the government's economic action plan, we are taking further action to strengthen the capacity of Canadian financial institutions to expand credit and to respond to gaps in credit markets. Through the economic action plan, we are providing up to $200 billion in existing and new measures to support the extension of financing to Canadians and Canadian businesses during the current extraordinary period.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420683">I see my colleague here from the finance committee. I would note that the finance committee has been looking at this. I want to commend members of all parties for their work on that issue. We have been looking at the access to credit issue at the finance committee for a number of weeks now. We are currently focusing on the whole pension issue, but we are also looking at the issue of financial literacy within the access to credit, which obviously affects the debate here today. The government and Parliament, through its committee structure, are looking at these very serious issues.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420684">In conclusion, our Conservative government has acted to protect consumers and we will continue to act. We have introduced tough new regulations with respect to credit card practices. We have acted to support and improve financial literacy. We have acted in terms of access to credit in the last budget. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420685">Unfortunately, we have had parties such as the NDP oppose us every step of the way, whether it is voting against the budget that its members have not read or introducing a motion like they have today without hearing from the three committees that will be investigating this very matter.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420686">I look forward to those committees investigating this matter, reporting their recommendations to the House of Commons, working with the government to ensure that Canadian consumers and businesses, especially those small business across this country, have access to credit at a cost that is not too high for them so that they can stay in business over a long period of time.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

He is a very well respected member of the House of Commons who always gives wonderful interventions in the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420688">While I have him here as the chair of the finance committee, I am going to ask him a few questions that he knows and all of us know are very important for our citizens. The first one deals with a single securities regulator. Can the hon. member tell us what his views are and what his government is going to do to enable Canada to have a single securities regulator?</ParaText><ParaText id="1420689">Second, he mentioned the very interesting issue of home building. I wanted to point out to him that the CREA, the Canadian Real Estate Association, has some excellent suggestions on tax rollover provisions that will enable us to get moneys flowing more easily through the system. This would provide a pool of private sector funds that could be used to build affordable housing across our country. I know the member has been very involved and interested in that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420690">Finally, on the issue of credit, we know that the absence of credit for our private sector is one of the major challenges that we have in this economic downturn. I think it is a good thing that the government has put money into EDC to enable it as a vehicle for this credit. I would strongly urge that these moneys not go to the banks. I personally have concerns that these moneys are going to go to improve the bottom line of the banks and not get to the people who need it. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420691">I just want to ask the member if his government would consider putting more money into EDC for moneys that should go to businesses that actually have developments, that are halfway through, and therefore currently have equity in their projects? These moneys can be used to provide some bridging funding as a loan to these developments that would enable them to continue to move forward. The risk to the taxpayer would be very low because there is already equity in these projects and it would provide real money to put Canadians back to work for projects in their communities.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

He asked many very substantive questions so I will try to address them all in turn.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420693">With respect to the single securities regulator, I share his view on that issue. It is absolutely a positive step forward for our country to do that and I certainly thank him for that support. In terms of raising money, in terms of having a uniform system across this country that investors, both domestic and foreign, can invest their money and apply under the same sort of guidelines and have the same force on mechanisms, that would certainly be a good thing for this country.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420694">I know the Bloc and the member on the finance committee from the NDP have raised concerns that Quebec has a very good system and it does not want to see that lost in terms of a national securities regulator, but the response to that is to say that the good things that happen within the Quebec system could be applied to the country as a whole. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420695">So if the securities regulation works well in Quebec, that is something we should apply to the entire country. I would also say that to people in my own province because there are people in Alberta concerned about a common securities regulator, so on that point I would certainly support that.</ParaText>

The hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128563" Type="2">Newton—North Delta</Affiliation>, I believe, brought forward a private member's bill in the last Parliament with respect to people being able to access more money out of their RRSPs. I commend the member, a fellow British Columbian of the hon. member opposite, for bringing that forward.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420697">In terms of the rollover issue, I have certainly heard that idea. It is an idea worthy of discussion and merit. It has not been acted upon thus far, but it is certainly something we could consider as we go forward in the next pre-budget hearings in the fall.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420698">With respect to the member's third area of credit, he is absolutely right. The biggest challenge facing businesses, small and large, across this country and consumers is access to credit. I am very glad that he is supportive of the measures with respect to providing more funds through BDC, EDC and CMHC. We had all these organizations before the committee on the access to credit issue. They are very welcome in terms of getting the money to them, but we have also expanded their role. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420699">In terms of current projects being eligible, obviously as a parliamentarian I would hesitate to say whether one project or another could be eligible, but in terms of EDC, it will have more money available to lend to credit worthy businesses, but it will also have an expanded role especially domestically here in Canada, in terms of what it can and cannot do. As the member would recognize, EDC is widely recognized as an excellent institution and I look forward to its even greater role both internationally and domestically here in Canada.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

In many cases we do not know the merchant discount rate because we need to have the consent of retailers to get that. I asked the retail council today whether we could get more information on that and it said it would gladly provide it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420706">With respect to the interchange rate, my understanding is that it is about 1.5%, so about 98.5% stays with the retailer and 1.5% is with the interchange. Whether that ends up with the credit company, or with the financial institution or the processor is one of the issues at which the committee will have to look. The interchange rate plus the other costs make up the merchant discount rate.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420707">The member raised the issue of premium cards. It is, in fact, true that for premium cards a higher rate is applied. American Express is the highest premium card. It charges such a high rate that in many cases many retailers do not even carry the card. We should look at this issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420708"> In terms of Canadians receiving these cards without their consent or without full information, a committee could legitimately look at and perhaps some action could be taken.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420709">As the minister has explained in the House, the economic action plan we have passed enables him to regulate in many of these areas with respect to better informing consumers about the products they are buying.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420710">My final response to the member would be that this model and the system that is in place is of a complicated nature such that it makes sense for members of the House of Commons committee and the Senate committee to look at this over the next month and report back to the House with some recommendations or actions that the government could take, in addition to the measures we have already taken.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

New Democrats are calling for immediate action to protect consumers from credit card interest rates and fees that are increasing by leaps and bounds. We want to put an end to unfair penalties and gouging.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420715">Usury has been illegal for centuries, but consumers are at the mercy of credit card companies and have been at this “untender” mercy for far too long. The latest increases in credit card rates and fees, combined with the economic recession, has resulted in families being unable to pay their mortgages, businesses shutting down and unbearable debt loads.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420716">Research from the Library of Parliament shows us that in the last 20 years real income for families in the middle and lower-income brackets has declined significantly. People at the top have done very well, thanks very much, but for people in the lower and middle-income levels, it is becoming tougher and tougher. What they have to spend for their families is less and less incrementally and families are noticing that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420717">Twenty years ago, 80% of disposable income was taken up with debt. Now it is 125% of disposable income. Therefore, many families live from paycheque to paycheque. They would rather not use their credit cards for family necessities, but they have no choice.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420718">Currently, consumers pay interest not on the current account balance, but on the previous month's balance. How frustrating it is to pay off one's credit card and see interest charges on the next month's balance.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420719">The personal debt of Canadians is of great concern. In 2008, 84% of Canadians reported having some kind of debt and 40% of those people feared they would be unable to make payments if an unexpected event occurred, such as an illness, accident or unexpected car or home repairs. Twenty-eight per cent of those with debt feared for their retirement. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420720">There is also the 25% who do not save at all, not even for retirement. These are people raising kids, trying to survive on part-time jobs and trying to save for their children's post-secondary education. As we all know, the cost of post-secondary education has increased exponentially and the amount the federal government gives to post-secondary education is nil. In fact, the debt load has been downloaded from the federal and provincial governments to students, who are the least able to manage.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420721">To add to increasing fees and interest rates, many Canadians are in danger and worry about being unable to pay their bills. One in five households could not handle an unforeseen expenditure of as little as $5,000. Sadly, a great number of people, 20%, are being forced to tap into their RRSPs just to make ends meet. That means they will have a pretty bleak and barren retirement.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420722"> Credit card companies often target those who can least afford the card, which maximizes company profits, with little care for financial ruin or the realities of the users.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420723">Seniors are often targeted and preyed upon by credit card companies. Results from a national public opinion poll reveal more than one-fifth of Canadians with credit cards have reported receiving those cards without ever asking for them. These are the new premium cards, about which we have heard, issued in the past year by companies such as MasterCard and Visa. The poll shows that among the group who receives these cards unsolicited were many elderly people, students too. People already burdened by huge debt, as I indicated, are seeing their interest rates creep higher and higher, pushing them further and further into debt.</ParaText>

Cuts to the post-secondary education of our students, as I indicated, has created these unbearable debts.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420725">Families already struggling to make ends meet are taking on bigger and bigger debt loads, including using their credit cards for essentials like groceries, hydro bills.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420726">With the influx of the new premium cards, without knowing it, consumers are reducing the already small margins made by local businesses, and we have heard about this too. With charges of up to 4% on the total price of a sale instead of a flat transaction cost, businesses are on the brink of shutting down.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420727">I thought the government was a friend of small business.

							<ParaText id="1420730">According to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, 82% of Canadians with credit cards support tighter rules on the industry. Owners of small businesses are very much in step with that general public opinion in wanting greater oversight on this industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420731">In Canada there are about 50.4 million credit cards in circulation, which totals more than two credit cards per adult. About 22.2 million of those cards carry a balance. In contrast, in 1983 there were only 12.1 million cards, or less than one card per adult. In 1984 Canadians paid $6 billion in interest on credit cards, loans and lines of credit. Now, Canadians pay more than $22 billion. No wonder bank profits are ballooning.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420732">This very much highlights the pervasiveness of credit cards in Canada and the potential danger that many families face. We know that the current economic climate and the fact that our economy is struggling is directly related to bad debt, and credit card companies are only making things worse by increasing the debt load of Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420733">The Canadian Community Reinvestment Coalition has also spoken out about this issue and has stated:</ParaText><ParaText id="1420734"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The Conservatives claim that to help the economy they have to cut taxes to put money in our pockets, but they are doing nothing to stop the big banks from gouging money out of our pockets, and they are giving the banks hundreds of billions of dollars of our money and not requiring anything in return...</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>

I would especially like to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="128626" Type="2">Sudbury</Affiliation> for bringing forward this very important motion.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420750">A number of other members today have talked about the various elements of the motion. I will not read the whole motion, but I do want to touch on a couple of points in the motion. It says, “That, in the opinion of the House, the government should take action to protect consumers who are particularly vulnerable in tough economic times”. It goes on to lay out a number of specific actions that we request the government to take, such as “protect consumers from 'any time, any reason' interest rate increases and account changes; prohibit unfair application of card payments; protect cardholders who pay on time; limit abusive fees and penalties”, and so on.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420751">I am sure that people are wondering why this issue has come up at this particular time. We know that credit card companies in many cases have charged exorbitant rates over a number of years. They have gotten away with it. They are largely unregulated. Why are we raising this issue now? Let me tell people why we are raising it now. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420752"> In my community of Nanaimo—Cowichan and many communities across this country, workers are losing their jobs. Communities that have been used to good paying jobs, that have been used to some economic stability, are losing their viability. It seems that every time we think the worst of the news has surfaced, we hear another bad news story.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420753">Yesterday, I had a call from a constituent who works at the Crofton mill. The mill has downsized to a mere fraction of the jobs that it has had in the community for a number of years. The mill in Crofton is particularly important because it contributes substantially to the North Cowichan municipal tax base. The worker was so concerned not only about his own livelihood, but about what was happening in his community that he took the time to call me. He asked me if I knew the latest thing that will impact on the forestry sector in British Columbia and the rest of Canada. I want to refer to a story which appeared in the April 16 issue of the Victoria <I>Times Colonist.</I> The headline reads, “U.S. federal handout threatens pulp sector; Tax credit to decrease fossil fuels in production has serious loophole”.

							<ParaText id="1420758">It makes it even more important to talk about what I would call credit card abuse by the companies, the issuers of these credit cards. When families are reeling, wondering if they can pay their rent or mortgage and feed their children, we must take every measure possible to make sure that working and middle class Canadian families have every single protection that is possible from their government. It is the duty and the role of government to make sure that its citizens are not being taken advantage of by companies that simply have no conscience. They are prepared to do whatever it takes to make a profit, no matter what the impact is on families, on men, women and young people.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420759"> We are talking about young people who are receiving unsolicited credit cards, young people who are just starting out in life, young people who perhaps want to save money to buy a car or make a down payment on a house.

However, when the government introduces this legislation, it will have to make sure it respects the areas of jurisdiction of Quebec and the provinces. In Quebec, consumer protection legislation has been in force since 1971. It sets out strict requirements regarding contracts for credit cards of all sorts. It will be important therefore to respect Quebec's expertise and jurisdiction. Once again, the Quebec nation has taken the lead over the Canadian federation in protecting its merchants and its consumers. In addition, the organization known as Option consommateurs sees that the rules are followed. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420792"> In order to understand the development of credit cards, we have to understand the principle of habit, almost obligation, created by the major credit card companies.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420793"> And what of Quebeckers' and Canadians' financial situation? It is true that debt is a major problem in the country. According to a survey done by the Certified General Accountants Association of Canada in the spring of 2007, 84% of Canadians reported being in debt, 14% of all Canadians reported a significant increase in their debt and, most notably, 40% of Quebeckers and Canadians in debt believe that their debt hurts their chances of being financially secure in the event of unforeseen circumstances. In the spring of 2007, the current recession was just starting. The current government did not even realize that there was a recession. Let us not forget the remarks by the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> during the 2008 election campaign.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420794"> The level of Canadians' and Quebeckers' personal savings has decreased hugely since the 1980s, dropping from a high of 20.2% in 1982 to a low of 1.2% in 2005. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420795"> It is true that the spread between the Bank of Canada's key lending rate and credit card interest rates is growing. To help Canadians and Quebeckers, the Bank of Canada lowered its key lending rate several times to today's level of 0.25%, the lowest in Canadian history. Recession oblige, you might say. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420796"> In the case of the major credit card companies, a credit card should be a matter of choice for individual consumers, but is that really the case? Just try to book a hotel room without a credit card. This is just one example. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420797"> Because of cuts by the federal government to transfers to the provinces, Quebec has had to cut funding to home economics organizations, many providing information on credit. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420798"> However, business oblige, and the major credit card companies, MasterCard and Visa, not to mention any names, are working miracles to make access to supposedly easy credit all the easier, but in tandem with a rate of interest to consumers often over 20%. Consumers increasingly use credit cards as a method of payment. We should therefore expect credit card charges to drop.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420799"> Despite increased volumes of sales, reduced fraud, lower interest rates and improved technology, credit card rates continue to rise. It seems that the main problem involves information and awareness about the benefits and the risks of credit. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420800"> A survey by Nanos Research has revealed that 55% of Canadians have a poor understanding of the costs of credit cards—63% think that the charges increase without a corresponding increase in terms of value and 67% think that the credit card companies do not explain their charges clearly.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="00">(1700)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1420801"> Another survey ordered by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business shows that 82% of Quebec card holders support having the credit card industry more strictly regulated.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420802"> And what about merchants? The credit card companies charge those who accept a credit card from customers doing business with them. Approximately 10¢ is currently charged merchants on average for each debit transaction, regardless of the amount of the purchase. Credit card transactions average $45 per transaction. The credit card companies are preparing to increase transaction fees charged retailers. The consumer does not see these fees. They currently represent about 2% regardless of the amount of the transaction. Applying a hypothetical charge of 1% would represent, then, 45¢, an increase of over 400%. Who, but the consumer, do you think, is going to pay this dizzying increase?</ParaText><ParaText id="1420803"> On top of that, Canadian retailers have higher hidden costs than do retailers in other industrialized countries. True, the major banks and financial institutions reap a significant profit from this. In 2007, alone, the fees amounted to $4.5 billion in Canada.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420804">Most credit cards are issued by a limited number of companies. Visa and Mastercard control close to 85% of the credit card market, and this gives them total freedom to impose charges and conditions on retailers. One might therefore wonder whether the hikes in hidden fees might not be a sign of abuse of a dominant position. In order to ensure that there is no abuse by issuing companies, the Bloc Québécois contacted the Competition Bureau this past January in order to have the commissioner examine the issue. The Bureau's powers are limited, however. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420805">This is why the Bloc Québécois introduced a bill to reinforce the Competition Act during the last parliament, Bill <Document DbId="3076433" Type="4">C-454</Document>. That bill would have given the Competition Bureau the power to carry out its own real investigations into the industry. At the present time it cannot, on its own, do more than general studies that have no clout. With its own investigations, it will be able to summon witnesses and protect them. If the companies conspire together on price-fixing, they will leave no proof of having done so.If witnesses cannot be summoned and protected, it is very likely that no anti-competitive practice will ever be proven. When businesses want to enter into agreements with their competition, they will have to prove that such agreements are in the public interest. At present, these agreements with competitors are allowed, unless it can be successfully proven that they are contrary to the public interest.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420806">This is not all the Bloc Québécois has done. Following on representations by the Quebec coalition of merchants opposed to the increase in transaction fees on credit and debit cards, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128423" Type="2">Saint-Maurice—Champlain</Affiliation> and I got the following motion passed by the Standing Committee on Finance. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420807"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> That the Finance Committee conduct a study of the various debit and credit card transaction fees imposed on merchants as well as the standard and transactional practices that justify them and report its observations and recommendations to the House. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1420808">This study will be undertaken shortly, in the next few weeks. It will make it possible to hear from a number of witnesses as well as various stakeholders. This will enable the committee to formulate its recommendations to the government. These could then serve as the basis for the legislative measure called for in the motion presented today by the NDP.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420809">As I said, the Bloc Québécois is therefore in favour of the motion, because consumers need legislation to ensure they are protected. The Bloc will, however, ensure that this legislative measure introduced by the government fully respects the jurisdiction of Quebec and the provinces. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It will therefore be important for both Quebec’s jurisdiction and Quebec’s expertise in this regard, which is considerable, to be taken into account. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420814">I would like to point out, and I will come back to this later if time permits, that in 2007 the Supreme Court denied a financial institution leave to appeal in a case involving one of the largest exemplary damage awards in the history of Quebec. That decision affirmed a decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal, and confirmed Quebec’s jurisdiction and its ability to protect consumers in their dealings with credit card issuers. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420815">I will not read the motion before us in full, but we do agree that debt is a major problem in Canada and we find it surprising, to say the least, that the gap between the Bank of Canada’s key lending rate and credit card interest rates is continually growing, when we might have thought, given the rising numbers of all sorts of cards being widely used by consumers, that competition should be narrowing the gap. Surprisingly, the reverse is happening. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420816"> It is also true that the big banks and financial institutions are making large profits from that gap, and even though a few of the items in the NDP motion do not all come within the jurisdiction of the federal government, we believe it is worthwhile for the federal government to take action in relation to matters within its own jurisdiction in this regard. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420817">On that point, item (a) in the motion before us talks about a measure that would “protect consumers from ‘any time, any reason’ interest rate increases and account changes”. That could provide a useful starting point that would, in this case, come under the jurisdiction of the federal government. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420818">We have long said that the federal government could look into linking the credit interest rate to the Bank of Canada's key lending rate with reference to the criminal rate in section 347 of the criminal code, which would better synchronize the cost of credit and the usual rate of interest. In other words, rather than having the criminal rate in section 347 set in absolute terms, we think the government should look into making it relative, if you will, to the key lending rate of the Bank of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420819"> Since I referred to it earlier, I would like to elaborate on the matter of provincial jurisdiction. Everything that concerns local business and civil law comes under the jurisdiction of the provinces and Quebec. So the companies issuing credit cards are subject to the rules of consumer protection contracts in each jurisdiction.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420820"> The legislation on consumer protection sets out many strict requirements specifically governing credit cards of all kinds. Section 118, for example, defines variable credit and raises the issue of credit cards. Section 126 provides that a company issuing a credit card must send a statement of account to consumers setting out a number of points I will not mention here, but which are described quite explicitly in the legislation.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1420821"> Section 128 provides that a company issuing credit cards may not increase the limit of the variable credit, called usually a line of credit or credit limit, except at the express request of the consumer. That is very important, and I will come back to that. For example, it is provided that notice of any change to the terms of a variable credit contract must be sent at least 30 days before it takes effect. So we can see that there are regulations in Quebec to protect consumers and that the Government of Quebec can, if it wishes, continue to legislate in this area. We believe, however, that the federal government could also do its part in its own areas of jurisdiction, as I mentioned earlier. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420822"> A number of examples of class actions are currently before the courts in Quebec against the practices of financial institutions contravening the Consumer Protection Act. I will come back to this later. I would, however, like to give a few examples of practices considered dubious. The typical example is that of over credit limit fees. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420823"> American journalist Bob Sullivan wrote a book on the hidden fees paid by American consumers. Practices in Canada are similar in many respects. Hidden fees include the famous over credit limit fees. The problem lies in the fact that the companies issuing credit cards now allow consumers to exceed the limit of the credit card rather than simply refusing the transaction. They subsequently charge the over credit limit fee. In the United States, the fees run between $10 and $35, which is similar to such fees in Canada. Within my own circle, someone mentioned this problem to me. I was stunned to learn that an institution could charge fees when, in a way, it was the negligent party since it had allowed the credit limit established under contract to be exceeded. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420824">In 2004 and 2006, Option consommateurs launched a class action suit against certain financial institutions which issued credit cards. Their suit was against financial institutions which had made unilateral decisions to raise customers' credit limits and to allow people to exceed their limits by imposing over-limit charges, fortunately an offence under the Consumer Protection Act. I would emphasize that what was “fortunate” was that this practice is banned by the consumer legislation, and not the non-compliance with the law by certain companies. I am sure that was understood by everyone. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420825">So, in November 2006 and October 2007, this class action was allowed by the Superior Court against the following financial institutions: Amex Canada and the Bank of Nova Scotia for over-limit charges to customers; Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Citibank Canada, HSBC Canada, MBNA Canada, and the Bank of Montreal, for both raising credit limits without the cardholder's consent and for imposing over-limit fees. The National Bank of Canada was also included for increasing credit limits.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420826">According to Option consommateurs, the purpose of this class action was to obtain the reimbursement of illegally charged fees and exemplary damages. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420827">In closing, it might be worth pointing out that the consumer protection bureau states in its Internet site that:</ParaText><ParaText id="1420828">
								<Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The merchant or financial institution cannot raise the credit limit, if there is one, except at the express request of the cardholder. The mere fact that the consumer exceeds his or her original credit limit by making a purchase or purchases does not constitute an express request within the meaning of the act. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1420829">The class action is still underway and we wish good luck to all those involved .</ParaText><ParaText id="1420830">I will not have time to discuss excess late payment charges. I will simply point out that it would be appropriate, in these difficult economic times, for the government to pass legislation on this. That is why we are supporting the NDP motion. </ParaText>

On the other hand we have to make sure that we keep the economy moving and we have the essential services moving as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420853">I can give a perfect example. During the 2004 election when I was going door to door in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="128563" Type="2">Newton—North Delta</Affiliation>, I had heard many concerns from the Telus workers who were on strike for many months.

In these tough economic times it is very clear, and it is known, that the government has failed to protect those workers and Canadians. When we look at surplus budgets, budget after budget we had a surplus, but the government brought us down and it has driven us into a tough situation where we have to make decisions on how these workers can protect themselves. They are all worried about their jobs.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420856">Last week I met with the police association. Their members are also worried because the government brought in a pay cut for those police officers. They are the first responders and if they do not have the right to protect themselves, that is a shame.

While the two entities are apart in their desires and how they intend to get there, they are nonetheless in a process where they are going to sit down and try to find an amenable situation where they can come to some sort of an agreement.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420868">When this third force, or third leg, is entered into the process, it makes the water murky and prohibits the bargaining process from going forward and concluding. The employer thinks it has the additional leg up and can exact what it needs from its employees through this third leg when it comes to introducing scabs into the workplace. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420869">History has shown us what it has done. It has made strikes last longer. It has caused undue violence and hardship to all the parties concerned. Not only are those scabs ostracized and perhaps violence inflicted on them, unfortunately, but we see violence on the picket line when legitimate picketers are run down by vehicles driven by those intent on getting scabs into a workplace.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420870">My hon. colleague from the Bloc and I have absolute proof of that. Not so many years ago, in Chatham, a gentleman on a picket line was run over by a van driven by a security force hired by that company to try to get scabs into the workplace. It never succeeded in doing that. The company likes to call them “replacement” workers, because that sounds like a really nice word; if folks do not want to work, they will just replace them with someone else. What they really are in the vernacular are scabs. They are taking work and taking the bread and food off the tables of those hard workers who have been there for a long time.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420871">That man was run over and seriously injured. To this day, he has not been able, and will probably never be able, to return to his work as an electrician. All he was doing was participating in a legal strike, no more and no less. He was not perpetrating violence on anyone. He was not doing what we would consider to be illegal, nor did the law see it to be illegal. He was involved in a legitimate picket. Yet that group of individuals working for that security force took it upon themselves to drive that van through a group of people.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420872">They did not drive through a barricade or the picket line barrels used to keep people warm in the winter. They drove through a group of people as if the van were a bowling ball and the people were the pins. They knocked this gentleman down and critically injured him, almost killing him. Unfortunately for him and his family, he has obviously not been able to return to work. He has suffered many operations over the years because of a situation in Ontario where the use of scabs and replacement workers was permitted.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1420873">If we were to pass this and get back to truly bargaining, the parties would actually understand that they had to bargain and that they had to get to a conclusion. What we have learned in the bargaining process, those of us who have intimate knowledge of it, those of us who have done it, is that we eventually get to the end of that process. We get it resolved. We never win everything we want, but neither do we lose everything we think we are going to lose. At the end, we actually have an agreement between the parties that allows those parties to continue forward, that company to flourish, and those workers to be rewarded in the sense that they feel is justified. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420874">However, when we have replacement workers, what enters into that process makes it very difficult. In fact, it is poison. After everything gets resolved, we have a poisoned atmosphere when the workers who went strike or got locked out eventually return to work. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420875">I will use my Conservative colleagues across the way as an example. We will still be in the same place at the end of the day. What that means is that we will still have to work together. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420876">If we poison the atmosphere because we bring in scabs, that atmosphere remains poisoned for years, in some situations, because folks do not forgive that easily when they have been left out not just necessarily in the cold but have been left in poverty because they have not been able to get back to work when indeed a bargaining process could have enabled that to happen.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420877">So we end up with a situation that is avoidable. That is the real dilemma in all of this. It is an unnatural thing that gets brought into the bargaining process. The times we see replacement workers, in nearly every instance, it is in a unionized workplace. I do not know of any other circumstances, and I will allow other members to perhaps teach me some history that I may not know of where we see replacement scab workers coming into a workplace that is non-unionized. It is only targeted at those workplaces where the workers themselves, in a democratic process, have chosen to be organized and have chosen the union to represent them. They have said to that employer that this is the group they wish to have speak for them. Yet we as a government have the ability to make sure that level playing field happens again and that we do not have that third intrusion, which really is this gap.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420878">When we talk about democratic rights, about human rights, and about the right to organize and bargain, this is a fundamental principle. If memory serves me correctly, there was an appeal to the charter about the right to organize a union for a specific sector of workers, and the charter spoke to that and said they had the absolute right.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420879">I would suggest that what we need to see is the absolute right for the bargaining process to be allowed to continue to its fruition. Again, as I say, it will not always be perfect. The bargaining process never is, because it is with opposing parties, having opposing views, and trying to find resolution. However, what I do know is that the parties, especially when it comes to organized labour, understand and take their responsibility very seriously. They understand that taking their members out on strike will indeed cause great hardship on their members. They do not do it lightly.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420880">I think if we had the ability to make sure that the process was not interrupted by replacement workers, we would absolutely find that process moved more quickly, came to better results, gave us more harmonious labour relations, and indeed, at the end of it, made sure that we did not see another gentleman like the one we saw in Chatham, who is maimed for life.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420881"> I think that is why we need to have this done. We need to support this bill. I would encourage all members in the House to support it because it really is about protecting workers, and I think that is what we all stand for.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

On 11 separate occasions, the Liberals and the Conservatives have worked together to defeat those bills. We came closest to passing a bill on the subject at hand during the last government. Unfortunately, when it reached report stage, the Liberals listened to their leader, the one who replaced Paul Martin, because they were so worried about Bay Street.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420884">The day after they realized that our bill would not make it past second reading to third reading and then to the Senate before being passed into law, the Liberals introduced a very similar bill in which they changed just two words to try to save face. However, when the time came to place it on the orders of the day for debate in the House of Commons, it was delayed for so long that the sponsor, the labour critic, was replaced by another member who was strongly opposed to the bill. They saved face and remained true to form. Dark blue or red, they are cut from the same cloth and they all have it in for workers. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420885">It is also important to remember that the first time the Bloc Québécois introduced this bill, the NDP voted against it because the nasty separatists were introducing a bill. Fortunately, they saw the light, which I hope the Liberals and Conservatives will do one day, and they supported us the other 10 times. We want people to know that. We must avoid repeating the ignominy of violating the rights of striking or locked-out workers who are out picketing while people are taking their jobs so that the employer keeps turning a profit while the workers are forced to live on the meagre strike pay they get, if they get any at all. When this happens, the two sides are not negotiating on a level playing field.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420886">We must also remember that when the previous government was in power, 19 Conservatives voted to refer the bill to committee. But when the time came to take a formal stand, only one stood up and the other 18 toed the party line and voted against workers.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420887">In Quebec, 7% of workers are likely to fall victim to strikebreakers, because they are governed by the Canada Labour Code. In 1977, during the first term of the PQ government of René Lévesque, a sovereigntist government that cared about Quebec and its workers, the National Assembly passed an anti-scab law, which is still in effect today. It is still in effect, and it has shortened strikes. During negotiations, it has become imperative to find a way to avoid a strike. But in sectors under federal jurisdiction, strikes took place after 1977, and they were often extremely violent. People crossed the picket lines and took food out of the mouths of the strikers' children. The strikers negotiated in good faith while these people took away their livelihood. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1420888">And all under the eyes of the federal government. That is completely unacceptable. Harmony is needed and the Bloc Québécois is the party of Quebeckers. Since 1993 we have held a majority of the seats in the House of Commons because the people of Quebec trust the Bloc Québécois, because we fight so that Quebeckers will have better living conditions and to make sure that the money sent to the federal government, as long as we are in this federation, comes back to us so that it respects the consensus in the National Assembly of Quebec. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420889">Anti-scab legislation is essential if we are to have civilized bargaining when disputes occur. In fact, there is no real, full recognition of the right to strike unless the use of scabs, the people who take away workers’ jobs during a strike, is prohibited. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420890">In October 2003, the Bloc Québécois introduced a petition with 46,000 signatures supporting the position of workers and calling on the government to enact anti-scab legislation. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420891">Under the last Conservative government—you were there, Mr. Speaker—we will recall what the Minister of Labour at the time, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128366" Type="2">Jonquière—Alma</Affiliation>, had to say. In 1990 he supported an anti-scab bill, when he was an MP in the Mulroney government. He voted in favour of that legislation. And then, when he became a minister, he turned his back on workers. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420892">I was the sponsor of Bill <Document DbId="2169666" Type="4">C-257</Document>, to introduce anti-scab legislation. In the Human Resources Committee I heard apocalyptic tales, things that simply could not be believed. My stars, it was worthy of a B-grade horror movie. He said that if the baggage handlers at an airport went on strike, Canada’s economy would be paralyzed. Any more and he would have said that the earth would stop rotating on its axis. There was a provision for maintaining essential services. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420893">For a minister to say things like that amounts to saying just anything at all. He said that if telephone operators went on strike, 911 would cease to function. Any more and he would have had the crime rate quintupling or more, because that falls under telecommunications, and that is under federal jurisdiction. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420894">He did go farther. He spoke directly to the Liberals in committee and told them that when they returned to power—and that indicates just how much confidence he has in his government—recess would be over because of the separatists in the Bloc and the New Democrats and they would have labour relations problems, and that is completely false. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420895">British Columbia has also had anti-scab legislation since 1993, and Quebec has had it since 1977. I hope that Quebeckers who fly the red or dark blue colours today remember that this bill has brought about a much healthier labour relations climate in Quebec and much less violence in labour relations situations under Quebec’s jurisdiction. It covers 93% of workers in Quebec. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420896">I hope that members will have their hearts in the right place and will allow the other 7% of workers in Quebec to enjoy the benefits of anti-scab legislation. At the same time, and as fallout from that, I am proud to say that Canadians throughout Canada will benefit from it as well. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Indeed, the principle of this motion is no different than the objectives of the last bill on the matter, Bill C-415.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420902">It is important to note that the Canada Labour Code is already very specific on the matter of responsibility of federal employers and unions in the event of a strike or lockout. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420903">At present, the code does not impose a complete ban on the use of replacement workers during a work stoppage. However, the use of replacement workers with a view to undermining the union’s representational capacity, rather than the pursuit of legitimate bargaining objectives, is prohibited and constitutes an unfair labour practice.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420904"> In addition, it requires the parties to maintain the services necessary to prevent immediate and serious risk to public health or safety. This applies to all employers under federal jurisdiction. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420905">The opposition members go on about the fact that two provinces, Quebec—my home province—and British Columbia, have had a ban on replacement workers for some time.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420906">They claim that labour relations are more harmonious in those provinces than in others or in areas under federal jurisdiction when it comes to strikes and lockouts. Like most generalizations, I doubt that claim would withstand closer scrutiny.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420907">Indeed, in 2005 and 2008, in other words, very recently, Quebec had the highest strike and lockout rate in Canada. So how can anyone claim that the ban on replacement workers has improved the state of labour relations?</ParaText><ParaText id="1420908">I would like to raise some other issues that deserve further attention.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420909">Every time we debate the issue of replacement workers, we make a point of referring to the broad experience on which the member of the Sims task force based their report which led to major changes in the Canada Labour Code. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420910">We should point out that the experts did not reach agreement on the matter of replacement workers and wisely decided not to recommend that their use be totally banned, unless used for the purpose of undermining the union's representational capacity, according to the Canadian Industrial Relations Board. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420911">The previous government is responsible for introducing the current provision in the Canada Labour Code, and we agree with its decision with respect to the bills which sought to ban the use of replacement workers. It felt it was preferable to take the stakeholders' opinions into account and not to make arbitrary amendments to the labour legislation when there was no urgent reason to do so.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420912">As hon. members are aware, the counterbalance to labour's right to strike is management's right to try to continue operations during the strike. When there is no collective agreement in place, the employer can do everything necessary in order to maintain its activities, provided of course that it does not violate the representational capacity I referred to just now.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420913">In a unionized working environment, however, the two parties have opposing interests, but the employer certainly has the right to keep the business open.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420914">On the other hand, if a labour union deems that its rights have been violated in any way whatsoever, it may file a complaint with the Canadian Industrial Relations Board. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1420915">However, we know that the board receives very few complaints, and in the majority of cases management and labour agree to renew the collective agreement and the complaints are withdrawn. As for the complaints not withdrawn by unions, the board felt that, in most cases, there had been no illegal use of replacement workers.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420916">Major employers under federal jurisdiction do not use replacement workers. What is more, the changes to the code proposed in the motion would be a threat to small and medium businesses, the ones most likely to suffer from long closures.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420917">This therefore leads me to conclude that the present system is working and does not need changing. I cannot support this motion and I would encourage other hon. members to follow suit. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Vincent" id="2717303"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128305" Type="2">Mr. Robert Vincent (Shefford, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1420918">Mr. Speaker, what the Conservative member just said is interesting. I do not know if he is unfamiliar with the law or the file, or if he did not take an interest in the matter or if someone wrote his speech for him. I will be examining three elements broached by the Conservative member. The first concerns essential services. Of course we must maintain essential services in the event of a strike. I understand that. Had he dug a little deeper he would already know that section 87.4 of the Canada Labour Code states the following:</ParaText><ParaText id="1420919"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">During a strike or lockout not prohibited by this Part, the employer, the trade union and the employees in the bargaining unit must continue the supply of services, operation of facilities or production of goods to the extent necessary to prevent an immediate and serious danger to the safety or health of the public. </QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText><ParaText id="1420920">This section is clearly designed to ensure that essential services will be available to the public. Thus, what the member said earlier does not hold water because this section of the Canada Labour Code ensures that employers are covered when it comes to essential services. That is my first point.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420921">Second, the member referred to the report of the Sims task force. I will provide him with a better understanding of this report because I am convinced that he has never read it and heard about it from someone else. The use of scabs results in frustration, animosity and violence. It prolongs conflicts significantly. Statistics show that this is true. Allow me to return to the famous Sims report. I note that opponents of the bill find it useful. However, the report is full of major contradictions, leading me to put some of its proposals and statistics into perspective. According to Andrew Sims, the main author of the report, in 1991 and 1994, in Canada, 75% of employers with a labour conflict did not use replacement workers during strikes. Why? Because rather than creating animosity among certain workers they preferred to maintain stable relations with them. That is what the Sims report says.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420922">The other 25% of employers, however—who were party to 12 labour conflicts in which 48% of the employees involved were governed by the Canada Labour Code—did hire scabs. Scabs should not be used to shut out the union or undermine its role. It is important to show that employers who use scabs do so precisely in order to freeze out the union, as confirmed by complaints of unfair practices and statements from the strikers themselves. They say that the issue can go to court. Then the court hears that the unions are not being recognized because they do not have the power to negotiate with the employer. Employers have the upper hand because, under the Canada Labour Code, they can hire scabs. Employers can crush the unions if they want. Under the Canada Labour Code, workers have no power to negotiate. How can they conduct proper negotiations with their employers if they have no power because scabs go in to take their places? It has to be frustrating to be on the picket line, watching scabs show up to do the work. How frustrating.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420923">There is another issue nobody ever considers when hiring scabs, and that is workplace health and safety. The Canada Labour Code governs that too. Employers hire people who have no work experience whatsoever to work in any sector they please. Employers tell them, “Come on over guys, come work here today. Do not worry about health and safety. Do not worry about training. We have to produce. We cannot lose any money.” Employers get scabs to come and work because the real workers refuse to work, because according to the law they have the right to strike.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="00">(1800)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1420924">That right is the only way workers have to stand up for themselves when negotiating a collective agreement. They can say that they are not being paid well enough and that the non-monetary clauses should be adjusted. It is the only time they can stand up and tell the employer as equals what clauses they would like to have added to or changed in their collective agreement.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420925">Today, labour contracts are negotiated. Interestingly, collective agreements used to have terms of a year or two, and for a time they extended for three years. Now, labour contracts run for six to ten years. People can project what will happen tomorrow. They can do that in collective agreements, but the government cannot even figure out whether we are in a recession or an economic crisis while it is happening. During the most recent election campaign, we saw that it did not even know that there was a recession even though we were in the middle of an economic crisis.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420926">How can workers negotiate a 7-year or 10-year collective agreement and predict what wages will be in 10 years? Workers negotiate in good faith with the employer to reach an agreement. They want to keep working for the employer, and they hope the company will continue to grow exponentially so that they will earn good wages. They consent to an agreement with a 7-year or 10-year term.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420927">But when the collective agreement expires and they exercise their right to strike or the employer locks them out, a third party, the strikebreaker, cannot be allowed to take the worker's place. This impedes workers' right to collective bargaining. Employers and members from other parties say that the company must not lose contracts or money.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420928">The workers, for their part, work their butts off—some even die working. There are so many work-related injuries. Despite safety measures, people get injured, lose their limbs, even lose their lives. Some people give their lives for the company. Then, when the workers want to negotiate in good faith, employers laugh in their faces and tell them that if they do not want to work or are not happy with their pay, they are free to leave. Employers know that others will take their places and will be happy to work.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420929">We have seen this happen in the past, in cases like Radio Nord. That conflict lasted so long that the scabs demanded to be unionized. What a paradox. Employees were locked out and others came to take their places, then the employer treated them so badly that they decided to unionize. Replacement workers cannot be accredited and given rights that do not exist when workers who are already unionized are striking just outside. That makes no sense.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420930">That is why it is so important for us to get rid of replacement workers, of scabs, so that the two parties can have proper negotiations. If we get rid of scabs, there will be fewer conflicts, and any conflicts that do arise will not last nearly as long. The member said that labour conflicts in Quebec last a lot longer than conflicts in sectors governed by the Canada Labour Code. That is not true. The latter last much longer, simply because replacement workers can take over a company for years if they want to. We have seen replacement workers take unionized workers' jobs for a year, two or even three. That is why the conflicts last forever. The employer does not have to negotiate with the workers.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420931">Mr. Speaker, thank you for listening. You have listened closely to what I have been saying, and I appreciate that.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

This motion, if passed, will ban the right of federal employers to use replacement workers during a labour stoppage.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420934">These proposed measures should not be treated lightly. This motion is the most recent of a series of attempts by some members of the House to try to bring wholesale changes to federal labour law in Canada without consultation or compromise.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420935">Let me be clear. We remain firmly opposed to the motion, just as we have been opposed to similar legislation or legislative efforts introduced previously in the House. Our position is clear. We do not support the proposed amendments in Motion No. 294, and there are four compelling reasons why.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420936">First, our modernized Canada Labour Code works well. It provides adequate protection to employees involved in a legal work stoppage.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420937">Second, the motion, if passed, will disrupt the balance that was achieved when the Canada Labour Code was modernized back in 1999. It will leave federal employers unable to operate at minimal levels during a strike or lockout. This in turn could result in productivity losses to our national economy at a time when Canadians can least afford it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420938">Third, it would make labour relations more adversarial in the country. Energies and resources should be focused on solving labour relation issues in a peaceful manner. This is a situation that no one can afford to have happen during times of economic uncertainty both in Canada and around the world.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420939">Fourth, we do not see any compelling evidence to support the argument that a ban on the use of replacement workers would reduce the number or duration of work stoppages and benefit workers in a federal jurisdiction.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420940">As I mentioned earlier, the motion is the latest in a series of similar legislative efforts. It is worth taking a moment to take note of that fact, because they share some of the common characteristics and deficiencies of previous legislative efforts over the last number of years.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420941">Over the past two decades, the House had debated numerous private members' bills on the matter of replacement workers in the federal domain.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420942">First, there was Bill C-201, tabled in April of 1989. Next, there was Bill C-317, tabled in June of 1995. There were two more attempts between 2002 and 2005 in the form of Bill <Document DbId="608611" Type="4">C-328</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="1444021" Type="4">C-263</Document>, the latter of which was defeated after second reading. Next, there was Bill <Document DbId="2169666" Type="4">C-257</Document>, tabled in May of 2006. It was also defeated on third reading. Finally, there was the predecessor to the motion before us today, which was Bill <Document DbId="3073355" Type="4">C-415</Document>. It died on the order paper at the dissolution of Parliament in September of 2008.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420943">All these bills were defeated because a majority of members of the House recognized that what each bill proposed would be ineffective and would have negative effects on labour relations and on the economic health of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420944">A common characteristic shared by some of the more recent legislative efforts is that they do not fully consider just how vital it is that a middle ground be maintained between unions and employers on the matter of replacement workers. They overlook what was accomplished when the Canada Labour Code was modernized in 1999. The existing replacement worker provision in section 94(2.1) of the Labour Code was the product of much consultation with stakeholders. It also provided an ever important characteristic, one that is the backbone of this country, and that is compromise.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1420945">Existing provisions do permit employers to at least try to carry on basic operations during work stoppages. However, it also protects the union's right to strike and its bargaining authority. The balance would have been lost if any of these private member's bills had been passed by the House to eventually become law.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420946">Motion No. 294 before this House today is no different in terms of the disruption that it would pose to labour relations and the economic health of our nation. As with the private member's bills that have preceded it, this motion stands in complete opposition to the well-established facts about replacement worker legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420947">I will review these key facts in the House right now.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420948">First, legislation of that nature is rare in Canada. Only two provinces have legislation that restricts the right of employers to use the services of replacement workers during work stoppages. Quebec implemented its legislation in 1977. In 1993, British Columbia passed its own regulations. Ontario had enacted similar provisions in 1993 but they were repealed in 1995.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420949">That leads me to my second point of fact. After nearly two decades of experience with this kind of legislation in Quebec and in British Columbia, the results are not encouraging for Canadian workers. Statistical data analysis provided by the labour program suggests both of these provinces continue to experience work stoppages of long duration and the length of their work stoppages is not that much different from other jurisdictions in Canada that do not have the replacement worker legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420950">For instance, in the period from 2005 to 2007, the average duration of a work stoppage in Quebec was 43.8 days compared to 43.6 days in Ontario and 41 days in the federal jurisdiction. This data supports independent findings which maintain that statutory prohibitions on the use of replacement workers are not necessarily effective in reducing the duration of a work stoppage.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420951">That takes me to the third key fact that I want to share with the House this evening. Since the 1980s, over 90% of disputes in federal jurisdiction have been settled without a work stoppage, and that is often with the assistance of federal mediators and officers. In the majority of cases, employers do not employ external replacement workers to keep their operations functioning. Instead, they reassign management and other non-bargaining unit personnel.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420952">What does Motion No. 294 seek to accomplish? In light of the facts that I have shared with the House, it is unclear what the drafters of Motion No. 294 are seeking to accomplish with this latest in a series of legislative attempts to drastically revise the Canada Labour Code, the outcome of which would essentially outlaw any use of replacement workers in the federal jurisdiction. It cannot be to bring about balance and fairness to labour relations in Canada. The proposed amendments would undo what has been achieved over the past decade. It cannot be a solution to help reduce the number of work stoppages. The experiences in the two provinces with anti-replacement worker legislation show us that they continue to struggle with lengthy work stoppages. It cannot be a solution that would help boost Canada's ability in today's competitive environment.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420953"> The proposed amendments call for changes that would bring instability and uncertainty to Canadian labour relations and would do so in the midst of significant global economic difficulties.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420954">The facts and the risks posed by anti-replacement worker legislation are just as clear today as they were in the past. As with each previous legislative attempt introduced in this House, this motion calls for amendments that would ultimately harm workers and undermine the labour peace that both sides have enjoyed for years.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420955">For those reasons, I remain firmly opposed to this motion.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

They are a necessity in today's working world because they provide greater transparency in case of conflict.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420966">The federal government needs to assume its responsibilities in areas over which it has constitutional jurisdiction. In these difficult economic times, the government needs to assume some leadership and keep in mind that it has a duty to protect the most vulnerable: those who are at risk of losing their jobs. It needs to protect labour relations, before, during and after a labour conflict. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420967">Let us acknowledge the full importance our working people hold in our society and give them all the recognition they deserve for the work they do, day after day. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420968">Lacking any valid arguments, the Conservative government is taking refuge behind scenarios that have no connection with Quebec reality. Thanks to the efforts of René Lévesque. Quebec has for 30 years had legislation that bans the use of replacement workers. We have healthy labour relations and the 7% of Quebec workers who come under federal legislation should be entitled to the same.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420969">I urge my Liberal, Conservative and NDP colleagues to support this measure proposed today by the Bloc Québécois with respect to labour relations, in order to ban the use of scabs or replacement workers in labour conflicts involving employees who come under the Canada Labour Code.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420970">The message is such a simple one.

Today I hope I will get a more detailed explanation of what the Conservatives are doing to address our economic crisis and to answer my question.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420983">We have a very serious economic situation and taxpayers expect us to spend their money wisely because it is their money. We need to be very judicious with public funds at a time of economic crisis and a recession, but first we need a government that really understands the nature and the depth of the problem. So far, we have not have had that.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420984">We have a government that started out by saying that Canada would avoid a recession when it was already clear that we were in a recession. Then it acknowledged that it was a recession but just a technical recession, not a real one. Then it was a synchronized global recession, as though that were an explanation for its past inability to understand the fiscal and financial realities that were obvious to other parties. After that, it was a mild recession and now it is a serious recession. I have a lot of concern that we have a government that is wrestling to figure out what is going on rather than how it can help.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420985">I also want to comment on the idea of this being a mild recession. It is insulting to the 300,000 Canadians who have lost their jobs since January 1 and to the almost 15% of young people who are unemployed. </ParaText><ParaText id="1420986">The finance minister said that his analysis that this was a mild recession related to the fact that most people came from other places, including the United Kingdom, that most came on boats, that many came with nothing and that many died as a result of contracting diseases while travelling to Canada. He was painting a picture of everything but covered wagons and horses and buggies, as though that had to do with the human distress that people are experiencing, people whose life-savings are being drained away, people who built small businesses and are now e bankrupt with the assets they were aiming to retire on gone.</ParaText>

It is important that all Canadians fully understand what it is that the Liberals would do had they been given an opportunity to do so.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420989">Let us go back just a few short months ago when the Liberals were crying out for more money, billions of dollars, to be infused into the Canadian economy. So much so that at the time they tried to form an unholy coalition with the NDP and the Bloc Québécois in an attempt to wrest control of government away from a duly elected, democratically elected government, this Conservative government. Luckily, sanity prevailed, due in large part, I believe, to the visceral outrage of Canadians from coast to coast to coast against the concept of such a coalition.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420990">Once things calmed down, our government brought down a budget on January 27 recognizing the worldwide global deterioration of the economy. We brought in a stimulus package with that budget which on a percentage basis to the GDP was probably larger than any other country in the industrialized world.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420991">What was the reaction of the Liberal Party at that time? The Liberals said it was not enough. They said we must do more and pump more money into the economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420992">As a result of the stimulus package, we are going to be experiencing a short-term deficit. But the Liberal solution was to make the deficit larger because the Liberals were criticizing us for not going far enough.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420993">Now fast forward to today. What is the position of the Liberal Party? The Liberals actually have the audacity to criticize our government for having a deficit, when in fact they would have had a much larger deficit. They criticize us for creating the deficit, when in fact they were advocating a deficit.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420994">What is the reaction of the Liberal leader? What is the position of the Liberal leader in dealing with the deficit? He said, and these are his words not mine, “We must raise taxes”. Yes, that is right, incredible as it sounds, the Liberal leader is saying that we must raise taxes to pay off the deficit.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420995">This should not surprise anyone who has followed the career of the Liberal leader because he has a history of favouring higher taxes. Only a few short years ago he characterized himself as being a “tax and spend Liberal”, his words not mine.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1420996">Also, he has advocated, as has the rest of his party, that they bring forward a carbon tax. That was the previous Liberal leader's pet project in the last election. He was the father of the doomed federal carbon tax that the Liberals were projecting.</ParaText><ParaText id="1420997">As well, the Liberal leader and the rest of his party criticized us for lowering the GST from 7% to 5%. The Liberal leader has constantly advocated raising taxes, and now he must answer the basic questions that all Canadians have: What taxes would he raise? How much would he raise taxes? Who would pay for these taxes?</ParaText><ParaText id="1420998">The Liberal leader and the Liberal Party are absolutely giddy in anticipation these days of the possibility of an election. I can guarantee one thing: when the election does come, there will be a very basic and fundamental question that all Canadians will be asking, which party and which leader best protects the Canadian taxpayer? Will it be the Conservative Party led by <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister Harper</Affiliation>, who has obviously always lowered taxes, or the Liberal Party and the Liberal leader who advocate raising taxes?</ParaText><ParaText id="1420999">That is the debate I want to have.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Indeed, during these sessions, the government had already defined legislation as the only option for bands to choose. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1421010">We also have the Safe Drinking Water Foundation's advanced aboriginal water treatment team being highly critical of this process. It has indicated a number of problems, including the fact that invitations were problematic because first nations communities did not receive adequate notice to attend and the timing of the sessions overlapped with critical annual budgeting events which prevented many leaders from attending. </ParaText><ParaText id="1421011">The facilitators provided misleading or incomplete information to participants and government voices tended to dominate their conversations advocating for a particular goal. Having water quality on reserves be subject to variations of less strict provincial guidelines instead of the guidelines for Canadian drinking water quality, thereby abdicating its fiduciary responsibility and liability for first nations drinking water quality.</ParaText><ParaText id="1421012">Later in its report, it talked about the fact that the SDWF's AAWTT feels that the INAC's engagement sessions and attempts to deal with first nations drinking water quality were utterly inadequate, did not offer opportunity for meaningful consultation, diminished first nations' treaty rights and attempted to absolve INAC of its fiduciary responsibility. The SDWF's position in this respect was further explained and it went on to outline a number of problems with the process.</ParaText>

In some cases the bands received the information package at noon the day before and had to drive three hours in order to even get to a session.

As a result of this mobilization, the federal justice minister appointed the Pay Equity Task Force in 2001 to examine the shortcomings of the system and propose solutions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1421036">The task force spent three years doing extensive research on the issue and consulting with unions, women's groups, and human rights groups throughout the country. The group organized round tables with unions and employers to understand the problems and explore proposed solutions, particularly in Ontario and Quebec.</ParaText><ParaText id="1421037">In May 2004, the task force published its report, <I>Pay Equity: A New Approach to a Fundamental Right</I>, which contained several recommendations. The main recommendation was that the government put in place proactive pay equity legislation. We hoped that the government would move forward with this proactive legislation. We waited but realized that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> did not support pay equity.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1421038">In 1998, when he was the head of the National Citizens Coalition, he declared, “For taxpayers, pay equity is a rip-off. And it has nothing to do with gender. Both men and women taxpayers will pay additional money to both men and women in the civil service. That is why the federal government should scrap its ridiculous pay equity law.” </ParaText><ParaText id="1421039">Thus, it is not surprising that the Conservative Party is doing an about-face on pay equity and today wants us to pass so-called legislation requiring these people to attempt to obtain a small degree of pay equity through collective bargaining. That is not how you achieve pay equity. Pay equity is a right that should be guaranteed.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="1421041">There is no about-face here, and I hope that I will provide clarity on this issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="1421042">The Public Sector Equitable Compensation Act was tabled as part of the government's Budget Implementation Act, 2009 on February 6 and it received royal assent on March 12. I would like to take the opportunity to thank all the members who supported the legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1421043"> This act replaces an adversarial complaints-based system with a collaborative one as part of the collective bargaining process.</ParaText><ParaText id="1421044"> Our government respects the principle of equal pay for work of equal value. That is why we have acted to ensure a more modern and collaborative approach to equitable compensation in the federal public service. Our approach brings much needed reform to our complaint-based pay equity regime, which has proved to be a lengthy, costly and adversarial process, a process that does not serve employees or employers well.</ParaText><ParaText id="1421045">Our government is proud to be leading the way when it comes to recruitment and compensation of employees. </ParaText><ParaText id="1421046">We should be especially proud of the progress toward gender balance in the public services, particularly within the senior ranks. It is worth noting that back in 1983 fewer than 5% of women were in senior management. Today, women are approaching half of the senior and executive ranks of the federal public service. They are not only taking the top jobs, but their representation in many groups has also increased dramatically over the years.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1421047">Today's public service provides women and men with equal access to all positions and identical wages within the same groups and levels. I am proud of the example we are setting for both private and public sector organizations around the world.</ParaText><ParaText id="1421048">Given this situation and given the need to ensure the strides women have made in the federal public sector continue to be maintained, we have put in place a more modern approach to pay equity from public service employees. We need to put an end to the long and drawn out court cases of the past.</ParaText><ParaText id="1421049">Before this act, public service employers and unions were not required to take pay equity issues into account during wage setting. The issues were raised only when complaints were made. Many Canadians would be surprised to know that the last court case on pay equity concluded in 1999, at a cost of millions of dollars to taxpayers, a settlement that took over 15 years to achieve.</ParaText><ParaText id="1421050"> Public service employees deserve better. Taxpayers deserve better. This has clearly been a case of justice delayed being justice denied. That is no longer acceptable.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1421051">The new system will address any unfairness in women's wages and deal with it straight up, instead of allowing a settlement to drag on in the courts. It will make employers and bargaining agents jointly accountable for setting fair wages. It will ensure these decisions are made at the time of collective bargaining for unionized employees. It will impose a rigorous process to ensure employers address pay equity in a timely way for non-unionized employees.</ParaText><ParaText id="1421052"> The legislation ensures that such prolonged court cases become a thing of the past. This is about doing the right thing, finally, for Canadian women. Our government makes no apologies for taking long overdue steps to protect the rights of women to fair and equitable pay.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

If the government had been that interested in listening to employees, women's groups, and the people affected by the pay equity problem, we would clearly see that these people have not been heard. Unfortunately, once again, they are conducting bogus consultations. They pretend they were acting in people's best interests, but it was in the interests of the government. They do not care about people's best interests.</ParaText><ParaText id="1421054">The people involved are all against this pay equity legislation and were very sorry to see it hidden within the budget. That prevented us from debating it properly and publicly, and from having an informed debate. Now, any debate on it was drowned out by the budget debate and we were not able to discuss it, and the government was in a hurry to see it passed by the Liberals, who had no choice but to accept it, in order to avoid an election. That is the reality.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
