This was recently underlined in a report produced by a former Liberal MP, which was based on telephone recordings made by the NGO, the Coalition to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong in China. The report cites a price list on a Chinese transplant centre's website, which offers corneas for $30,000, kidneys for $62,000, livers for $130,000 and lungs for $170,000. All this despite the fact that China supposedly banned organ trafficking in 2007.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091217">Organ harvesting without consent is wrong and must be stopped. If China is serious about human rights, as it says it is through trade talks, then China must get serious about stopping this barbaric practice or we should stop trade negotiations.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Your explanation to the House was as follows:</ParaText><ParaText id="3091520"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">—motions to delete clauses have always been found to be in order and it must also be noted have been selected at report stage. These motions are allowed at report stage because members may wish to express views on a clause without seeking to amend it. As is the case on such occasions, I have tried to minimize the amount of time spent in the House on this kind of motion by grouping them as tightly as possible and by applying the vote on one to as many others as possible.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3091521">While I am now raising an objection to this practice, Mr. Speaker, I know that you were simply following what has been done by the House and others on such occasions. However, when I looked into the written explanation for this practice, the practice that is written in our guidelines and practices for this place, I was somewhat surprised to find very little in the way of direct guidance for you as Speaker. In fact, what I found was very simply a passage in the Annotated Standing Orders of the House of Commons, on page 272 under Standing Order 76.1(5). To be clear, this is not the Standing Order itself, but rather, the explanation of it. All that is said is the following:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091522"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The Speaker determines the order in which the motions will be called and the effect of one vote on the others (for example, if the vote on one motion can be applied to another motion). The purpose of the voting scheme is to avoid the House having to vote twice on the same issue.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3091523">That is very clear. Even in this annotation to our Standing Orders, the intention of those groupings is to avoid having the House vote twice on the same issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091524">There is also a similar explanation in the <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, second edition, which I will, from this point on, refer to as O'Brien and Bosc. On page 784, it states:</ParaText><ParaText id="3091525"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">—the Speaker...also decides on how they will be grouped for voting, that is, the Speaker determines the order in which the motions in amendment will be called and the effect of one vote on the others. The purpose of the voting scheme is to obviate any requirement for two or more votes on the same issue.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3091526">It is pretty clear in its intention and its practice. To avoid voting more than once on the same thing is essential for the House. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091527">Here is the problem. The groupings that you, Mr. Speaker, created for the government's last large omnibus bill were not, in my view, limited to preventing multiple votes on the same issues. Groupings were made to have only one vote applied to completely different clauses in the bill, each of which constituted a separate and distinct issue for the House to address, which is in fact our guideline in our practices, not a suggestion but an actual strict rule and guideline.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091528">It is the government, with the help of its lawyers in the Department of Justice, that has told the House that it deemed each of the clauses to be distinct issues, not us in the opposition. If they were the same issue, they would be in the same clause.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091529">I submit that in the ongoing effort to review and improve the living tree of our procedures and practices, saving MPs from voting on the same issue is not what Speakers have been doing during the report stage groupings. It seems to me that they have been treating motions at report stage as a nuisance and one that should be severely limited, rather than as what they are, as was referenced in the practices before.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091530">I find this somewhat disturbing. If these motions are legitimate questions that the House is meant to deal with at report stage, the final stage, surely MPs should have a choice on how to vote on them. As it stands, MPs are forced to make one single vote on a multitude, sometimes dozens, of individual questions, which are separate in their concepts and ideas.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091531">A clear example of this practice comes again from your report stage ruling on Bill <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document> from June 11 of this year. Motion No. 143 is a motion I know you, Mr. Speaker, remember well. It read that Bill <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document> would be amended by defeating clause 68, good old clause 68. In your ruling, Mr. Speaker, MPs were told that with regard to Motion No. 143, the choice to vote yea or nay on that question would apply to 47 other individual questions, which MPs had moved and you, as Speaker, had selected for debate in the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091532">Those questions were: clauses 144 to 146, 149, 151 to 153, 156, 158, 170, 172, 174, 175, 177, 179, 194, 208, 201, 211, 213, 215 and 217, 222 to 224, 226, and 228 to 230, and 232 to 249.</ParaText>

That is all it did. It seems to me that some members may not want to oppose that change and would therefore tend to vote against the motion. However, that choice applies automatically to Motion No. 144, a completely different idea and concept. It asked to delete clause 69 of Bill <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document>. Clause 69 changed the definition of a navigable water and penalty under the act in question, which the same member could easily wish to support.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091536">Just to be clear, we voted once in the groupings that were made by your Chair. One motion on changing the heading in a French version of the bill was also connected to the very definition of a navigable water.

That goes against the rules and practices of the House.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091537">As a result of those groupings and nothing else, I am afraid to say, MPs were forced to make a single choice, yea or nay, despite the fact that they would be voting against their conscience no matter which way they voted.

The effect of these amendments to the Standing Orders was to eliminate what then constituted the equivalent of report stage. In 1968, the House undertook a thorough revision of its legislative process with the result that all bills, except for those based on supply or ways and means motions, were thenceforth to be referred to standing or special committees, and would not be reconsidered by a Committee of the Whole House. In addition, the House restored report stage [that was the trade-off] and empowered the Speaker to select and group amendments.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="3091601">That was the management aspect of it. </ParaText><ParaText id="3091602">Therefore, in restoring report stage, effectively, it was not done carte blanche, so that everything had to be considered.

As I said, that is particularly the case since each clause did carry separately in the clause-by-clause votes. </ParaText><ParaText id="3091625">The second paragraph of the note that is in our Standing Orders accompanying Standing Order 76.1(5) with respect to the Speaker's power to select amendments states in part, “It is not meant to be a reconsideration of the committee stage of a bill”. I repeat that: report stage is not to be a repeat of the consideration that occurred at committee.</ParaText>

Therefore, we have seen it happen before. We have seen that Parliament has decided that the kind of abuse that occurred in the past should not be allowed to be repeated and, hence, it changed our Standing Orders to reflect that such abuse should not be permitted and that you, Mr. Speaker, have the power to prevent it and to prevent the undue delay.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091630">In the present case we have again seen the notice paper flooded.

I am not a betting man, but I am willing to bet anyone in the House that I do not foresee any of them passing.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091631">We know that most of the motions have already been considered at committee. We know that the House has approved overwhelmingly the budget, the budgetary policy of the House and this particular legislation at second reading. By breaking these out into multiple deletion clauses and other frivolous and vexatious amendments, nothing is being achieved but a waste of time, resources and the discrediting of our parliamentary system. </ParaText><ParaText id="3091632">I respectfully submit that the Liberal and NDP report stage motions taken as a whole simply constitute an attempt to reverse the decision of the House at second reading of the bill, but to do so in ultra-slow motion. These amendments would be a reconsideration of committee stage and are of a nature that will merely serve to prolong unnecessarily the proceedings at report stage. Ultimately, if a member seeks to oppose the entirety or the preponderance of a piece of legislation, that member's recourse should lie in voting against the motion on concurrence in the bill in report stage, not in detaining the House through round-the-clock voting.</ParaText>

							<ParaText id="3091655">Others are similar in nature to amendments considered at committee. I would argue that the issue was generally considered by the committee. Therefore, report stage motions should not be selected.

I have been advised that officials in the Privy Council Office note that at least two of the motions by the member for <Affiliation DbId="170542" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation> would require a royal recommendation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091657"> Motion No. 381 would increase the government's liabilities in respect of refunds for employment insurance premiums to small business for 2012-13, which expands the provisions in the bill for such refunds for 2011. By adding two additional years, this motion alters the terms and conditions of the original royal recommendation attached to Bill <Document DbId="5754371" Type="3">C-45</Document> respecting the provision for such refunds for 2011.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091658">Motion No. 382 also increases spending in a manner that is not currently authorized.

							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3091659">As a result, this would go beyond the terms and conditions of the original royal recommendation.

They require some attention, because the independent member does not sit on committee. However, they should not be dealt with in such a manner that they represent, effectively, a harassment of the balance of the House. Compared to the several hundred amendments proposed by the member for <Affiliation DbId="170542" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation> in June, on Bill <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document>, her proposals as of today's date are slightly less unreasonable. However, the fact remains that the rights of individual members of Parliament must be balanced with the ability of the majority of the House to dispatch its business with some reasonable, practical speed. Allowing a single member of Parliament to hold the House hostage in a voting marathon is simply not reasonable.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091662"> I propose the following arrangement, which could, in future, extend to other government bills. </ParaText><ParaText id="3091663">Report stage motions submitted by a member of Parliament who is not part of a recognized party shall be selected in the manner provided for by our rules. The selected motions may be grouped for debate in the usual fashion. Subject to the next point, the voting patterns for the motions would be set in the usual manner, as required by the ordinary practices of considering legislative amendments. However, one amendment per independent member of Parliament would be chosen to be a test vote. The voting pattern for the rest of that independent member's motions would only be implemented if the test motion were adopted. A rejection of the test motion would be inferred as a rejection of all that member's proposals. Therefore, the balance of the independent member's motions would not be put to the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091664">In summary, any ordinary person familiar with parliamentary process, in even a passing way, would agree that more than 1,600 amendments are an abuse of process. Most should not be selected. In summary, this member's proposals are collectively a repetition of the committee stage and only seek to prolong report stage proceedings unnecessarily, particularly through the round-the-clock voting that would result.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091665">There is no evidence that the House would willingly agree to be subjected to this. In fact, the history of how our rules have changed and the Speaker's rulings since 1968 confirm this. The Speaker's power to select amendments is clearly designed to prevent that abuse from happening. Mr. Speaker, the note that accompanies Standing Order 76.1(5) is a further clear articulation and reinforcement of the notion that part of one's obligation as Speaker is to protect not just the rights of the minority or an individual member; it is also to protect the rights of all members of Parliament not to see this place brought to discredit through procedures that are entirely frivolous, vexatious, repetitious, designed to delay and certainly designed to inconvenience all members of Parliament to an extraordinary extent.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091666">I submit that the report stage motions, taken as a whole, run counter both to the spirit and the letter of the rules that govern our proceedings. Therefore, I recommend that most of the report stage motions on notice should not be selected and that the balance should be grouped in the manner I have proposed.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091667">Finally, I point out, Mr. Speaker, your ruling in the spring, even though it was not seen as sufficiently aggressive in some fashion and was not seen as efficient as some would have liked in terms of respecting the ability of this House to continue to function. You clearly said, with respect to the 871 motions placed on the notice paper, the following: </ParaText><ParaText id="3091668"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">[I]t is clearly not intended, nor do our rules and practices lend themselves to the taking of 871 consecutive votes.

Motions to delete have been dealt with in conformity with the grouping scheme you outlined....</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091669">Mr. Speaker, I have certainly given you a proposal that I think falls squarely within the context of what you established in your spring ruling. Here we see that the effort to be frivolous and vexatious has come close to, and has perhaps by now more than doubled, the effort to do so in the spring. The result, I am quite confident, will be the same in terms of the substantive outcome of those amendments. I invite you to ensure that the processes of this House are managed in such a fashion that our proceedings are not brought into discredit and are not made into a farce. Rather, they can operate in a fashion that allows views to be expressed but that also allows the nation's business to be done.</ParaText>

I hope you did not take that too personally from the government House leader. It was a little bit of a procedural smack-down of your previous ruling on Bill <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document>. I know that it was not meant personally, but boy, he did not appreciate your ruling before.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091672">In terms of the disrepute of the House and using procedural games to do it, this comes from a government that prorogued Parliament to avoid a confidence vote and then lectures the House on how it holds Parliament in high regard. </ParaText><ParaText id="3091673">The selection for debate my hon. friend spent so much of his time on was not our point at all. The point we were making was that, of course, you have the selection as to which motions come. Our entire premise, if he had been listening, was on the idea of what gets grouped together. I raised a very specific point with the member, with you and with the House to say that in the groupings last spring, many votes were put together that caused the members of Parliament to vote singly on multiple issues on which they may have had multiple opinions. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091674">The example I used in my speech, which I know my hon. colleague would understand and agree with, was that a single vote cast on changing the language in the French text in the bill was also connected and became the same vote as the definition of a navigable water. Any member of Parliament from the government or the opposition who may have agreed with the first part of the vote and disagreed with the second was allowed to vote only once. </ParaText><ParaText id="3091675">The point of the groupings is to allow members to vote freely and fairly. I know the government House leader has been very helpful, in his own eyes, in now grouping all the different amendments for you, Mr. Speaker. I know that he is often inconvenienced by the cost and the burdensome nature of democracy. However, I will remind him that receiving only 39% of the vote does not give the government somehow the mandate to run roughshod over our Parliament and our parliamentary procedure. </ParaText><ParaText id="3091676">The evil the member talked about and quoted often, and this is important as you seek to group amendments, with respect to vexatious amendments, were the 471 amendments moved by the Reform Party against the Nisga'a treaty. This is now coming from many members who were in that movement and in that party who did not like the treaty and moved commas and semicolons and periods around to try to delay the work of the House. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091677">There are many things Canadians can contemplate. However, the outright hypocrisy coming from Conservatives and former Reform members in saying that they do not like the rules that they themselves applied so vexatiously in the House of Commons in trying to deny the first modern-day treaty in Canadian history is passing strange.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091678">I will end on this. Democracy is from time to time a complicated and difficult process. It can be a difficult system. That is hard for the Conservative government to contemplate, but it is a much better system than the other options available for governing ourselves.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091679"> It seems to me that when we gave examples that the groupings are important to allow members to vote freely and fairly, the government House leader chose to ignore all of those things. It is the Speaker's choice as to which ones are vexatious and inconvenient. I said that in my comments to the House. If they are vexatious, they should not be chosen and selected for votes. What I did say was that in a grouping of these amendments, it is important that members are able to vote freely.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091680">It seems to me that the government helped make our point about the amendments, none of which have been moved. Many are serious and substantive amendments to improve, in this case, a 450-page piece of legislation. In the previous bill of some 425 pages, the government adopted none. Conservatives did not change a comma, a period or a semicolon or a single word of text. Somehow the government was able to create perfectly more than 900 pages of legislation without a single error or omission. It got it all right. We know that not to be true, because for Bill <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document>, the first omnibus bill, which was moved in the spring, Conservatives are now having to make corrections in Bill <Document DbId="5754371" Type="3">C-45</Document>, some months later, before they have even had a chance to enact the legislation. Therefore, were they perfect? No. </ParaText><ParaText id="3091681">Maybe from time to time the government may learn that slow and steady slide from feeling that they are somehow ordained with this perfection crosses into arrogance and is ultimately an allergy to Canadians. They want a government that is humble. They want a government that from time to time listens and does not believe that in all cases every piece of legislation it has written is perfect. It has already shown time and again that it writes bad legislation. Conservatives should use this process to make better their imperfect attempts at reforming Canadian law.</ParaText>

I hope I can only match that. I assure the House I will surpass him on the aspect of brevity.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091686">I rise on a point of order with respect to Bill <Document DbId="5295287" Type="4">C-377</Document>, an act to amend the income tax act (requirements for labour organizations). Although my colleagues from the NDP have also risen on this matter, I am not convinced the arguments they put forward have been complete in terms of substance. As such, I want to offer further points on this matter for your consideration, Mr. Speaker. </ParaText><ParaText id="3091687">I submit that Bill <Document DbId="5295287" Type="4">C-377</Document>'s provisions to provide for reporting and public disclosure of certain financial transactions and administrative practices of labour organizations envisages a new function and purpose within the Canada Revenue Agency, or CRA. As such, the terms and conditions of the royal recommendation that authorizes CRA's current spending are being altered so that a new and distinct authorization for spending is being permanently created, which will therefore require a royal recommendation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091688">Past Speakers have ruled that legislation imposing additional functions on bodies funded by public money, if the functions are substantially different from their existing functions, will require a royal recommendation. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091689">I believe that Bill <Document DbId="5295287" Type="4">C-377</Document> will require royal recommendation for two reasons. First, the bill creates a new purpose for CRA in terms of a public reporting function that has no obligatory ties to taxation under the Income Tax Act. The bill would follow up on this additional purpose by creating what the CRA characterizes as “a comprehensive system that includes electronic processing, validations, and automatic posting to the CRA Web site”.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091690">The Income Tax Act is concerned with the taxation of individuals, organizations and businesses. Any reporting requirements imposed on individuals and organizations are directly tied to their tax obligation or the exemption of these obligations. For example, charities can only keep their tax exempt status and donors only receive a tax receipt if the charity meets reporting requirements. </ParaText><ParaText id="3091691">The Canada Revenue Agency is responsible for applying and interpreting the Income Tax Act in this regard. The primary goal of the agency, as Canada's tax administrator, is to ensure that taxpayers comply with their tax obligations and that Canada's tax base is protected. I want to stress that again: tax obligation. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091692">Bill <Document DbId="5295287" Type="4">C-377</Document> is strictly a function of publicly reporting information on one specific group of individuals, in this case labour organizations and labour trusts, outside of any direct obligations that those organizations or their members must have under the Income Tax Act. Given that it would create an additional purpose and new program requirements that would amend the Income Tax Act and modify the purpose of the CRA, the result is a new expenditure. The bill should be accompanied by a royal recommendation. </ParaText><ParaText id="3091693">Mr. Speaker, I want to draw your attention to a Speaker's ruling in the other place on February 27, 1991 on pages 2262 through 2264 of the <I>Journals</I> regarding Bill S-18, an act to further the aspirations of the aboriginal peoples of Canada. The Speaker found that provisions imposing additional functions on bodies funded by public money, if the functions are substantially different from their existing functions, require royal recommendation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091694">The member for <Affiliation DbId="170506" Type="2">South Surrey—White Rock—Cloverdale</Affiliation> and the government will no doubt argue that because labour organizations receive a public benefit, as charities do, they should be required to report as charities do. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="25">(1625)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3091695">The simple rebuttal to this argument is the fact that the reporting requirement for charities is based on a tax obligation. A charity must publicly report information in order to keep the tax exempt status it receives and the preferential tax treatment its donors enjoy. This will simply not be the case with labour organizations under Bill <Document DbId="5295287" Type="4">C-377</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091696">To further disprove this counter-argument, I think we need to look no further than the first incarnation of Bill <Document DbId="5295287" Type="4">C-377</Document>, which was Bill <Document DbId="5146724" Type="4">C-317</Document>. The bill tied the reporting function of labour organizations to the enjoyment of the tax exempt status offered to them in paragraph (k) of subsection 149(1) of the Income Tax Act. Labour organizations not in compliance with the financial disclosure requirements outlined in Bill C-317 would lose their tax exempt status. Bill C-317 also sought to effect the tax treatment of union members if their union did not comply with its requirements by not allowing union dues to be tax deductible.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091697">In your ruling, Mr. Speaker, on Bill <Document DbId="5146724" Type="4">C-317</Document>, which was delivered on my birthday of November 4, 2011, and found on pages 2984 to 2986 of the <I>Debates</I>, you said that Bill C-317 had not respected the rules of the Standing Orders because to remove a tax exemption was in effect to raise taxes, which would require a ways and means motion, which the bill did not have.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091698">Your ruling, Mr. Speaker, disallowed that and forced the member for <Affiliation DbId="170506" Type="2">South Surrey—White Rock—Cloverdale</Affiliation> to remove the parts of the bill that tied the reporting requirements to the enjoyment of tax exempt status by labour organizations and tax deductibility of dues by their members. In doing so, there is no longer any direct tie or connection to taxation or benefits received by labour organizations or their members. Labour organizations or trusts who fail to comply with the requirements of Bill <Document DbId="5295287" Type="4">C-377</Document> will not lose their tax exempt status and their members will not lose the tax deductibility of their dues.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091699">Bill <Document DbId="5295287" Type="4">C-377</Document> solely becomes a simple public reporting function, which is a new function of the Income Tax Act and a new purpose for the CRA in its capacity to administer the act. As such, it should require a royal recommendation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091700">The second issue I want to bring to your attention, Mr. Speaker, has to do with how Bill <Document DbId="5295287" Type="4">C-377</Document> regulates the internal affairs of unions and their relationships with their members.

This sends a message that linguistic ability is not among the prerequisites and skills required to be appointed to these positions. As a member of Parliament from Quebec, I find this to be a completely unacceptable message. That is what I had to say about the first amendment. </ParaText><ParaText id="3091776">The second amendment that the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="170117" Type="2">Sudbury</Affiliation> proposed involved the creation of an advisory council in accordance with the second recommendation of the financial literacy task force.

							<ParaText id="3091777">Once again, this bill leaves much to be desired.

The government seems to think that websites have magical powers. That is the answer we always get any time we ask the ministers about the cuts made to public service positions responsible for answering questions from the public. We are often told that people can simply consult the website, because all of the information is there. That is more or less what we have heard from the government members who have spoken on this.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091779">Furthermore, people have a tendency to forget that we can teach financial literacy to Canadians and enhance their knowledge, but there is no point in explaining how to manage their money if they have no money to manage. Sometimes they have no money because the banking system is sucking up such a huge amount of money.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091780">I would like to give some of the figures from Canadian banks, which, as we know, have a virtual monopoly. Let us look at the banks' profits after taxes—not the total business but the profits. The profits of Canadian banks have increased from less than $10 billion—or to be more specific, $9.7 billion—in 2000 to over $25 billion in 2011.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091781">Twenty-five billion dollars for a population of approximately 35 million represents $700 per person. In other words, on average, a family of four gives $3,000 to Canadian banks. I see that the members opposite find that completely acceptable. They would say that this is a sign that the banking system is well managed. However, for me, it is a sign that we are all being swindled by the banks since they are charging ridiculous interest rates in certain cases, particularly in the case of credit cards.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091782">I would like to remind you of a proposal that was made and has been supported by the NDP for a number of years. We proposed that credit card interest rates be limited to 5% above the Bank of Canada's key lending rate, which has been at 1% since September 2010. Then, instead of having interest rates of 25% or 26% in some cases, an NDP government would legislate to have these rates limited to 6%.</ParaText>

							</ParaText><ParaText id="3091806">We need to recognize that financial institutions and banks in this country have an extremely powerful role to play with regard to persuasion over Canadians. It is that persuasion that could be used rightly or wrongly to affect the financial lives of Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091807">As well, members should keep in mind the glaring statistic that 26% of Canadians struggle with even the most basic numeracy and 56% do not have high enough levels of numeracy to demonstrate the skills and knowledge associated with the ability to function well in Canadian society. Keeping that fact in mind, we should all be worried. We should also be worried about the high level of domestic debt. This problem needs to be addressed.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091808">HRSDC reveals that the relevant statistics for financial literacy are 20% and 48%. If we compare that with the United States, Canada has one of the highest levels of annual costs for equity funds, which is 2.31% compared to 0.94% in the U.S. It is no wonder banks want more customers.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091809">The highest earning 11% of Canadians contribute more to RRSPs than the bottom 89% of tax filers combined. Canadian taxpayers subsidized those RRSPs to the tune of $7.3 billion in annual net tax expenditures. </ParaText><ParaText id="3091810">To continue with some interesting statistics, 30% of Canadian families lack any retirement savings outside of the Canadian pension plan. Also, as I mentioned before, Canadian household debt is at 150% of income and 25% of Canadians increased their debt load over the past year. In the last quarter, the CPP outperformed the markets by a margin of 10 to 1. </ParaText><ParaText id="3091811">Why am I referring to all of these statistics? It is because what we are discussing with the bill is the relationship of power between the average Canadian citizen's knowledge of the financial system and that of the banks in this country. If we do not empower Canadian citizens with the ability to understand the financial system and what financial institutions impose on them, then we are on a slippery slope. </ParaText><ParaText id="3091812">The measure proposed by Bill <Document DbId="5281963" Type="3">C-28</Document> is a good one. However, from our perspective, it is not enough.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="3091813">For example, we are concerned that there is no explicit requirement that the incumbent of this position be bilingual. And yet, we live in a country with two official languages.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091814">We believe that the person responsible for improving financial literacy throughout Canada must be able to communicate in both French and English. The minister of state has assured us that the incumbent will be bilingual, but the Conservatives are refusing to put this in the legislation. That worries us. </ParaText><ParaText id="3091815">The conclusions of the task force on financial literacy clearly state that the financial literacy leader must be kept apprised of the situation by an advisory council consisting of representatives of the industry, unions, educators, government and voluntary organizations from across Canada. This provision is included in this bill and will prevent the participation of a number of partners following implementation of financial literacy. The Financial Consumer Agency of Canada and the government have said that an advisory council will be established, but that this does not require legislation. This is confusing.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3091816">At committee stage, we proposed some amendments in order to address some of the shortcomings. We proposed that the requirement of bilingualism be added—we did ask for that—that a definition of financial literacy be added and that more responsibility be given to the incumbent of the position to be created.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091817">However, the Conservatives rejected our amendments. Stakeholders told us that creating this position is better than the status quo. The government has at least agreed to create this position. In light of the fact that the expenses related to this position were approved in the 2012 budget, we support the bill. We will nevertheless continue to push the government to go further. Even though it has taken a small step in the right direction, there is still a long way to go.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091818">How could we improve the situation? Financial literacy is an important aspect of consumer protection. The fact that many Canadians do not have savings and the rise in consumer debt are symptoms of the discrepancy between the rise in the cost of living and salaries, not financial illiteracy. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091819">Too many Canadians are living paycheque to paycheque. This situation proves that the government is not taking a leadership role and that it is incapable of addressing issues that are truly important to Canadians. The government has never implemented strict laws and regulations to protect consumers. This bill falls far short of providing any real help to consumers.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091820">We believe that the best way to support consumers is to establish a single-window consumer protection department or agency that would handle all consumer issues. If the government really wants to protect consumers, then it should move forward with credit card regulations, for instance, and implement important regulations that would cap interest rates and eliminate the excessive fees paid by consumers.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091821">We in the NDP have a better plan in mind for financial security for retirement. We need to strengthen the Canada and Quebec guaranteed pension plans by gradually doubling benefits in an affordable manner to a maximum of $1,920 a month, thereby providing Canadians with an adequate level of guaranteed income during their retirement. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091822">However, the government and politicians basically need to ensure that Canadians are educated and have access to financial training, as well as ensure that Canadians are protected, particularly from the banks, credit card companies and other financial institutions such as insurance companies, and the power they can hold over Canadians' lives. To that end, those institutions need to be properly controlled through legislation that focuses on the common good.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

					<ProceduralText TocType="TPC" id="20">Bill C-428. Second reading</ProceduralText><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Raynault" id="7821810"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170145" Type="2">Ms. Francine Raynault (Joliette, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3091884">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have the privilege of talking about an issue as important as the one addressed in Bill <Document DbId="5618344" Type="4">C-428</Document>. I believe that this bill is important because it tackles the horrible Indian Act of 1876. There can be no doubt that this bill is one of Canada's most archaic colonial legacies. That is why I commend the member for <Affiliation DbId="170607" Type="2">Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River</Affiliation> on his initiative. However, it is not enough. It is too little, too late. The Conservative government should consider a much farther-reaching rewrite of the Indian Act and a much more open process. </ParaText><ParaText id="3091885">As a New Democrat, I believe that a complete overhaul of this cursed bill should be led by aboriginals. If the changes are imposed unilaterally, then what, really, has changed? That is why Bill <Document DbId="5618344" Type="4">C-428</Document> seems inappropriate.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091886">I will explain why this bill is not likely to go down in history. I do not claim to have a plan to make up for 136 years of colonialism, but I can say that ideally, new legislation should be drafted in collaboration with aboriginals, be introduced by the government and honour the goals of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Because Bill <Document DbId="5618344" Type="4">C-428</Document> does not satisfy any of these conditions, I cannot support it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091887">I want to begin by pointing out that the goal of the 1876 act was the assimilation of all aboriginals and their forced integration into what was then a fledgling Canadian society. When I visit Manawan, people there are still speaking Atikamekw in 2012. In that respect, the act failed. It also includes many provisions that make life difficult for aboriginals. The government will have to do better than a private member's bill to fix it.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091888">In 1969, the Liberal Party tried to get rid of the act in order to integrate aboriginals into Canadian society. That was supposed to happen without compensation, without special status, and with no respect for treaties signed in the past. As one, aboriginals rejected the idea, but that does not mean they wanted to keep the Indian Act. Quite the contrary.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091889">In their red paper, aboriginals stated that it was neither possible nor desirable to abolish the Indian Act. They said that a review of the act was critical, but that it should not happen until treaty issues were resolved. Some 45 years later, that issue is still outstanding. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091890">Other attempts were explored in this House. In 1987, a list was made of discriminatory provisions in the Indian Act, and this led to a bill. Later, in 2003, the Liberals introduced Bill <Document DbId="514757" Type="3">C-7</Document>, which, once again, was heavily criticized by first nations. The Conservatives are now bringing forward Bill <Document DbId="5618344" Type="4">C-428</Document>, a private member's bill, which seems just as irrelevant as other attempts.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091891">In the words of Einstein, “Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.” In my opinion, this quote points to what is clearly lacking in Bill <Document DbId="5618344" Type="4">C-428</Document>: a different approach. Perhaps this flaw is the reason why there is very little support for the bill outside the Conservative caucus. The chief of the Assembly of First Nations, Shawn Atleo, said that this bill is along the same lines as the policy espoused in the 1969 white paper.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091892">Had the Conservatives listened to Mr. Atleo, they would have understood that what to do with aboriginals is no longer the question. In the 21st century, the question is: what do aboriginals want to do with us? <Sup></Sup></ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="55">(1855)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3091893">Bill <Document DbId="5618344" Type="4">C-428</Document>, which the Assembly of First Nations has said came out of nowhere, does not reflect the current reality. During the Crown–First Nations Gathering, the Conservative <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> spoke at length about how his government would work with the first nations.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091894">Aboriginal peoples were not consulted about Bill <Document DbId="5618344" Type="4">C-428</Document>, or about Bill <Document DbId="5258273" Type="3">C-27</Document> or Bill <Document DbId="5409479" Type="3">S-8</Document>. When the government promises something—and especially something so important—it must follow through. It is shameful to see that this government is not keeping its own promises.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091895">Speaking of broken promises, the government committed to removing the residential school provisions from the Indian Act. We can see that the government preferred to hide the clause in a private member's bill. The NDP thinks that something so important should come from the government, and with apologies, no less. The government must take responsibility and come up with a real, serious solution to replace the Indian Act.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091896">Bill <Document DbId="5618344" Type="4">C-428</Document> contains some clauses that seem to be chosen at random, when they are not downright negative. For example, the elimination of the provisions dealing with wills and estates could put aboriginal people in a very frustrating legal void. Does the bill's sponsor understand its implications?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091897">Finally, we must recognize that the living conditions of aboriginal people are getting worse all the time. While the first nations communities are experiencing an ongoing demographic boom, their social services budgets are increasing by only 2% a year, thanks to the Liberals. The fact that the social services budgets for other Canadians are increasing by 6% a year does not seem to bother the government at all.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091898">Malnutrition and education problems are hitting first nations communities hard. I am afraid that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> will have to do more than give a medal to Justin Bieber to make young aboriginals forget about this sad reality. When the government decides to really tackle the problems resulting from the Indian Act, I will be there.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091899">Furthermore, I expect that the proposed measure will be very much in line with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. This declaration, which Canada ignorantly refused to support, recognizes the specific needs of aboriginal people. It recognizes their right to be consulted about the use of resources on their land. Do we not owe at least that to those who played key roles in our history and the development of our economy?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091900">If the government does not change its attitude toward the first nations, they will understand that the NDP is the only party that can offer them a truly open consultation process. We want to help them to govern themselves. Other Canadians need to know that the excellent social services they receive must also be provided to aboriginal people, in a spirit of sharing and recognition.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091901">The Indian Act needs to be revised, but not without real consultation, clear objectives and a detailed plan of steps to follow. Unfortunately, Bill <Document DbId="5618344" Type="4">C-428</Document> does not meet any of these criteria.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="00">(1900)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Rickford" id="7821819"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170863" Type="18">Mr. Greg Rickford (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, for the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency and for the Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3091902">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to stand today to speak to the private member's bill from the member for <Affiliation DbId="170607" Type="2">Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River</Affiliation>. I count him not just as a colleague but as one of my personal friends. I could not be more pleased for the hard work he does, not just on the standing committee but as a first nations person in this place, starting a process that is long overdue and is a great opportunity for us as parliamentarians to debate.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091903">Tonight I will address a couple of elements in the private member's bill. First is the issue of first nation bylaw publication; second, outdated sections in the act; and finally, the repeal of the residential school references in the act.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091904">Currently, first nation band councils do not have the same opportunities that municipalities and rural municipalities have to independently develop bylaws. There is also no requirement for first nations to make their bylaws publicly available to their members. As a result, for years confusion has reigned as first nation residents and law enforcement officials have often found themselves in the dark as to the specific nature of the bylaws of each individual first nation. </ParaText><ParaText id="3091905">In addition, first nation band councils have had to go to the <Affiliation DbId="170680" Type="4">Minister of Aboriginal Affairs</Affiliation> to request approval for each and every bylaw. This cumbersome process has caused many bands to wait for extended lengths of time for approval or even to have their bylaws declined. Others have chosen to completely bypass the minister and as a result do not openly inform their membership of the changes to band bylaws.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091906">Bill <Document DbId="5618344" Type="4">C-428</Document> would create a more transparent and accountable process for first nation band members wherein first nation councils would be required to publish their bylaws on their website or via some easily accessible communication channel, such as a band newsletter or widely read local newspapers, television, et cetera. The bill would also eliminate the need to request approval from the minister. The requirement to make each first nation bylaw publicly accessible would provide clarity for first nation residents, visitors and law enforcement officials seeking to understand their role in either abiding by or enforcing these rules. It would also place the responsibility for these bylaw-making powers squarely back in the hands of the first nation, where it belongs, and provide grassroots members of the bands with greater accountability from their band councils. </ParaText><ParaText id="3091907">This change would benefit not only law enforcement officers who would more fully understand the expectations of the chief and council of each first nation for a given bylaw, but also those members of the council and band members eager to see the bylaws that they have enacted enforced in an efficient, effective and timely manner. Importantly, this change would also streamline the decision-making process by eliminating the unnecessary step of having to submit any and every new bylaw to the <Affiliation DbId="170680" Type="4">Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development</Affiliation> for approval. Currently, following the submission of new bylaws to the minister, there follows a 40-day period during which the law may be disallowed by the minister.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091908">Bill <Document DbId="5618344" Type="4">C-428</Document> would also repeal sections of the Indian Act that, while they remain in the law, are no longer enforced. This is equivalent to what we would call “legal underbrush”, which confuses the real issues facing the Crown and the first nations. We must clear this underbrush away, so that we can see the parts of the Indian Act that are substantively affecting the daily life of first nations. One of these is the removal of restrictions on the sale of produce from reserves. There are several other similar examples of sections of the Indian Act that are no longer enforced and that simply have no place in modern legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091909"> Though there have been numerous amendments to the Indian Act over the years, the substance of the statute remains very much in the 19th century and that fact is reflected in the language of the document. The bill would seek to do bring the language and content of the statute into the modern era. Incremental changes such as these would pave the way for future legislation to be developed in collaboration with first nation members that would benefit all Canadians.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="05">(1905)</Timestamp><ParaText id="3091910">Some of the detractors of Bill C-428 have chosen to ridicule this set of changes. That is misguided. As a lawyer, I feel very strongly that it is important to take those steps to remove from the law things that are no longer relevant, or in the case of residential schools, institutions we no longer support. It is a dark chapter in Canada's history and we must move on from that.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091911">By taking concrete steps to amend the language and remove outdated and irrelevant sections of the Indian Act, this bill addresses some of the challenges facing first nations communities in regard to their political, social and economic development.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091912">Bill <Document DbId="5618344" Type="4">C-428</Document> would also remove the provisions allowing for the establishment of residential schools. </ParaText><ParaText id="3091913">On June 11, 2008, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada made an impassioned and heartfelt apology to the first nations people of Canada for the treatment of children in residential schools, a sad and shameful chapter in our nation's history. The Prime Minister deservedly received praise, not only for the sentiment of the statement but also for the eloquence with which it was expressed and the sincerity of his remarks. Following this momentous apology, the government also announced its intent to repeal those sections of the Indian Act that allowed for the establishment of Indian residential schools and the removal of children from their homes and communities.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091914">Bill <Document DbId="5618344" Type="4">C-428</Document> would do exactly that. It would remove from the Indian Act, once and for all, any mention of residential schools as well as the outdated language dealing with the religion of first nations residents in relation to their schooling. This would ensure that no future government could open a residential school for first nations. </ParaText><ParaText id="3091915">The pain arising from the legacy of residential schools continues to affect constituents in the great Kenora riding and across the country. By removing this antiquated language and all references to residential schools, we can take another collective step on the path toward healing as a nation. </ParaText><ParaText id="3091916">While the horrors of the residential school situation cannot be erased or forgotten, removing the segments of the Indian Act, which still to this day refer to residential schools, can provide a path to better understanding and can reassure our first nations' communities of our commitment to never see this happen again.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091917">The Indian Act has had the effect of robbing children of their goals and ambitions. By nourishing and encouraging the dreams of first nations youth, we help not only these children but our entire community. For generations the Indian Act has allowed the potential of first nations youth to wither. We cannot afford to allow this waste to continue. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091918">The colonial and discriminatory nature of the Indian Act has led to decades of discrimination and cultural division. The residential schools were a vehicle for the social, cultural and spiritual destruction that was embedded in the act. Removing offensive and irrelevant sections from the Indian Act is symbolic and will help residential school survivors on their personal path to healing.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091919">Bill <Document DbId="5618344" Type="4">C-428</Document> has as its primary goal the empowerment of first nations people and their governments.

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Duncan (Edmonton—Strathcona)" id="7821829"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170183" Type="2">Ms. Linda Duncan (Edmonton—Strathcona, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="3091920">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House to speak to this bill. It is very clear that the member for <Affiliation DbId="170607" Type="2">Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River</Affiliation> has the best of intentions. With great regret, I have to join those who are opposed to this bill. For the most part, it is not because of the substantive changes the member has brought forward, which a number of members in his party have spoken for. The main problem with this bill is that it is breaking the constitutional obligation for advanced consultation, consideration and accommodation.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091921">I would go to the preamble of the member's bill. My concern with the preamble is the reference to the commitment of the Government of Canada to exploring creative options for the development of new legislation “in collaboration with the First Nations organizations that have demonstrated an interest in this work”. Right off the bat, the member is narrowing the constitutional obligation to consult with all first nations. Perhaps this was unintentional. The member might want to reconsider that, because I think he has the best of intentions for his fellow first nations. It fails to reference first nations governments, and that will derogate from the overriding constitutional obligation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091922">The bill proposes, as a number of members and the member who tabled the bill have pointed out, a number of measures to rescind or amend provisions in the Indian Act. For example, there are specific provisions to do with residential schools, wills and estates, the duty to attend school, the process for enacting band bylaws and the sale of produce. Few would oppose the right of Canadian first nations to make these kinds of decisions for their own peoples. The problem is not the intention of passing over those powers. The problem is the way in which the member has gone about it.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091923">Another measure I find problematic, which would be a good provision if the rest of the bill could stand and if it had been consulted on in advance, is that the bill would require the <Affiliation DbId="170680" Type="4">Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development</Affiliation> to report annually to the aboriginal affairs committee on actions taken to replace the Indian Act. What would have been preferable in such a bill, and I would think first nations would agree, is that the report should be to Parliament, which is normally what happens with a matter of interest to this place. Of course, there should be the duty of prior consultation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091924">The member suggested when he tabled the bill that clause 2 of the bill, on the minister reporting to the committee, also requires a collaborative consultation between first nations and the <Affiliation DbId="170680" Type="4">Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development</Affiliation> on the Indian Act. Regrettably, there is no such provision in the bill. It would have been a useful one and would certainly be supported by first nations.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091925">The biggest problem with this bill is the duty to consult. As I mentioned, and as should be known to members in this place, there is an overriding constitutional duty to consult. That duty was upheld in the famous Mikisew Cree case, which originated in my province, with the Mikisew Cree First Nation. It has been repeated in numerous cases since. That duty is on the Government of Canada to advance consultation, consideration and accommodation of first nation peoples' interests before any decision is made by the Government of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091926">That duty is reiterated in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in both articles 18 and 19. Article 18 states:</ParaText><ParaText id="3091927"><CommitteeQuote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Indigenous peoples have the right to participate in decision-making in matters which would affect their rights, through representatives chosen by themselves in accordance with their own procedures, as well as to maintain and develop their own indigenous decision-making institutions.</QuotePara></CommitteeQuote></ParaText><ParaText id="3091928">Article 19 states:</ParaText>

I conferred with a number of first nations, particularly in the Prairies, to determine their views so that I could share them in the House and confirm if they had been expressed to the member. This is what I have been able to determine. In the first nations that I was able to reach in Alberta, I was advised that several presentations were made by the member to the Alberta first nations after the tabling of the bill. That is not a case of advance consultation. Moreover, both of the sessions that were brought to my attention were ticketed events at a cost of $575, including for students. The notice for the meetings clearly said that space was limited and that it was not a consultation. </ParaText>

This is an individual who, as a first nation man, has conducted his whole life living under the Indian Act. He is someone who has been able to interact with his fellow first nation brothers and sisters for his entire life. This is consultation. It is a degree of consultation that no one in the House currently has, in my opinion, in their past. He has been meeting with people across Canada on this important subject. However, I do know of some recent bills that have not been consulted on.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091961">The member for <Affiliation DbId="170183" Type="2">Edmonton—Strathcona</Affiliation> has referred to article 18 of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. She is quite right, there is an obligation to consult with indigenous peoples. I wholly support that and I thank the member for bringing it up. However, there are cases where it has not happened. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091962">Yesterday, I was at the justice committee. Currently, Bill <Document DbId="5122660" Type="4">C-279</Document> is before the committee and we had witnesses from the Canadian Human Rights Commission. I asked the commission whether that bill had an impact on first nation people. Are first nation communities impacted by this act and does it have an impact on the lives of first nation people? Their answer was yes, that bill absolutely does affect first nation people. </ParaText><ParaText id="3091963">My question then became whether there was consultation on the bill? In fact, there was not. The member for <Affiliation DbId="170462" Type="2">Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</Affiliation> did not indicate that there was any consultation. I spoke with the Assembly of First Nations, which the member for <Affiliation DbId="170183" Type="2">Edmonton—Strathcona</Affiliation> referred to as an important entity with which we discuss these issues. They are the bona fide organization of first nation people. However, they were not contacted on that bill. Also, during those deliberations, the member for <Affiliation DbId="170299" Type="2">Gatineau</Affiliation>, in a cavalier way, just set aside that there was any obligation to consult with first nation people on that bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091964">Therefore, I take offence to what the member is suggesting. The member for <Affiliation DbId="170607" Type="2">Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River</Affiliation> is truly a hero to me and others in the first nation community for the work that he is doing. To suggest that we are not reaching out to our aboriginal friends is, in my opinion, not reality. It is something that we are endeavouring to do.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091965">I would ask the member to talk to some of her colleagues about some of the bills that they are proposing and the impact they have on first nation people. She shakes her head much like the member for <Affiliation DbId="170299" Type="2">Gatineau</Affiliation>, who cavalierly set it aside that there was any obligation to consult with first nation people on a bill that would impact their communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091966">As I said, this is an important day. The bill is timely and necessary. With each passing day, the Indian Act is revealed to be unfit for the times in which we live. When it was first enacted in 1876, it disenfranchised first nation people and it still disenfranchises everyone who lives under it today.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091967"> Just recently, we have seen a clear example of why the Indian Act must go in my home province. In fact, in Manitoba in Buffalo Point First Nation there are residents, women and children, living in that community who risk being put out on the street because of political disagreements with their chief. Because of these protests, they could have their homes taken away from them and be disenfranchised through the powers granted under the Indian Act. </ParaText>

Imagine if someone disagreed with their city councillor and all of a sudden were evicted from their home and put out on the street. There would be mass outrage and nobody would stand for that. This is the exact point I would like to make about this community and unfortunately sometimes other communities as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091969">Disenfranchisement is occurring. It violates not only any sense of justice or decency but all democratic principles, which is one reason and just one reason why the Indian Act needs to be replaced. It is an archaic, oppressive and unjust legislation. It denies aboriginal Canadians the rights they deserve. It denies individual rights. It denies matrimonial and property rights, leaving women in danger of losing everything due to disputes outside of their control.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091970">Many people may not be aware, but the Indian Act denies first nations people the right to control their own wills and estates. The <Affiliation DbId="170680" Type="4">Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development</Affiliation> has the power to void the will of a first nations person if he or she so chooses. As my colleague has said, Bill <Document DbId="5618344" Type="4">C-428</Document> would repeal the sections of the Indian Act that gives this paternalistic power to the minister. It would be a step toward true freedom and independence for first nations people.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091971">Bill <Document DbId="5618344" Type="4">C-428</Document> would also return the authority over the creation of bylaws on reserves where it belongs, with the leadership of that reserve. As it currently stands, the <Affiliation DbId="170680" Type="4">Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development</Affiliation> must sign off on bylaws made by leadership on reserves. First nations people can govern themselves. They do not need this pre-Confederation prison to remain. As with the wills and estates rules, this is a further denial of independence and decision making for first nations people.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091972">The Indian Act has no place in the 20th century or the 21st century. It is time to replace this act.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091973">The member for <Affiliation DbId="170762" Type="2">Kenora</Affiliation>, who was here earlier, has done great work as the <Affiliation DbId="170863" Type="18">parliamentary secretary to aboriginal affairs</Affiliation> and has been a great advocate for the Métis people in my community and first nations Inuit people as well. I think back to previous members from other parties in that riding who have also done great work. A former member of the Liberal Party, Mr. Robert Nault, who was the then minister of Indian Affairs, brought forward some very innovative solutions, namely the First Nations Governance Act, which I thought was a step in the right direction. Many first nations did not like that approach, but many did. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="3091974">One of the aspects of that bill on which everyone agreed was the Indian Act needed to be repealed. The starting point that everyone in the House agrees on is the Indian Act must be replaced.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091975">I have had the opportunity to work with first nations people from across Canada. I have had the opportunity to work with first nations chiefs, councillors and regular community members. There is no question that everyone believes it is time for this act to be replaced. I believe the Indian Act is nothing less than a prison that shackles aboriginal people in our country and prevents them from achieving economic actualization.</ParaText><ParaText id="3091976">We need to proceed with the initiatives that the member has proposed before the House. He started a debate that I am glad we are having. There are opinions from all sides on this matter, but what we can all agree on is that the Indian Act must be replaced.
