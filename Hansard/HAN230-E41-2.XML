Report Stage</ProceduralText><ParaText id="4158239">
The House resumed from May 28 consideration of Bill <Document DbId="6761928" Type="3">S-7, An Act to amend the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the Civil Marriage Act and the Criminal Code and to make consequential amendments to other Acts</Document>, as reported (without amendment) from the committee, and of the motions in Group No. 1.
</ParaText><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Kellway" id="8749369"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170669" Type="2">Mr. Matthew Kellway (Beaches—East York, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4158240">Mr. Speaker, I am standing today at report stage on Bill <Document DbId="6761928" Type="3">S-7</Document>, which has the very unfortunate short title “the zero tolerance for barbaric cultural practices act”. I stand in opposition to the main motion and in support of the NDP's proposed amendments to the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158241">I want to stress that I support the intent of the bill. No woman or child should be subject to any form of violence and certainly not to the forms of gender-based violence, such as forced marriage, polygamy, and underage marriage, the bill purports to address. Further, the fact of these forms of gender-based violence in Canadian society is not in dispute here, and neither is the fact that there are things we can do and ought to do to prevent and respond to the practices at issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158242">However, the bill is not the appropriate response and needs at a minimum to be amended, because it threatens to aggravate, not help, existing circumstances and to further victimize or re-victimize those subject to the practices the bill purports to address.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158243">The precautionary principle ought to apply here. The Conservative government has heard enough from enough knowledgeable people on the matter of the bill from those with experience and expertise in these matters to stop this here, to take a step back, and rethink its approach to this issue before it does more harm than good to people who need help.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158244">Here are the main provisions of the bill. It amends the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act to make polygamy grounds for inadmissibility to or removal from Canada of immigrants and permanent residents if there are reasonable grounds to believe that these individuals have practised, are practising, or may in future practise polygamy.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158245">It amends the Civil Marriage Act to make free and enlightened consent to marriage a legal requirement and to require that any previous marriage be dissolved or declared null before a new marriage is contracted and to make 16 years of age the minimum legal age for marriage.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158246">It amends the Criminal Code to clarify that it is an offence for an officiant to knowingly solemnize a marriage in contravention of federal law; to make it an offence to celebrate, aid or participate in a marriage rite or ceremony knowing that one of the persons being married is doing so against their will or is under the age of 16 years; to make it an offence to remove a child from Canada to marry a child against that child's will or if the child is under 16; to allow a judge to issue a peace bond for a period of up to two years if a person is suspected on reasonable grounds of preparing to force someone else to marry, to marry a child, or to remove a child from Canada for one of these purposes; and to address the issue of so-called honour killings to limit the defence of provocation to circumstances in which the victim engaged in conduct that would constitute an indictable offence under the Criminal Code that is punishable by five years or more in prison.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158247">However, stakeholders and expert witnesses have testified before the Senate Standing Committee on Human Rights and the House of Commons Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration that the bill is also likely to have many and serious unintended consequences. For example, the bill makes no provision to allow women who are conditional permanent residents to remain in Canada if their polygamist partner is deported. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158248">There is no clear definition of polygamy, leading, likely, to confusion and potentially arbitrary decisions regarding deportation and inadmissibility and discrimination against nationals from certain countries. </ParaText><ParaText id="4158249">UNICEF has expressed concern that the bill would criminalize minors who celebrate, aid, or participate in forced marriages, and UNICEF has recommended exemptions for children and young people from certain provisions in the bill. </ParaText><ParaText id="4158250"> Criminalization, in the context of family and social relations, may end up simply driving these practices underground. </ParaText><ParaText id="4158251">In all of this, the bill falls in a long line of socially insensitive, ham-fisted and unsophisticated responses to complex social issues by the Conservative government.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158252">In March 2012, for example, the Conservatives introduced new measures to crack down on marriage fraud, including a requirement for a sponsored spouse to live with the sponsor for two years or face deportation and possible criminal charges. Clearly, this measure leaves women reluctant to report abuse, because they fear losing permanent residency. Consequently, they are vulnerable to abuse.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158253">In April 2014, the Conservative member for <Affiliation DbId="170092" Type="2">Mississauga South</Affiliation> introduced a motion that purported to deal with forced marriages by banning marriages by proxy or by telephone, for example, from qualifying for spousal sponsorship. Distance marriages of this sort are largely conducted by refugees, so we have the consequence that this motion would serve to limit family reunification rather than limit forced marriages.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158254">These are the kinds of sensitivities, nuances, understandings, et cetera, missing from the Conservative government's world view, and it is problematic. </ParaText><ParaText id="4158255">Beyond that, and just as egregiously, the current Conservative government forgoes opportunities to even consider, much less heed, the advice of those who actually understand the complexity of these issues. For example, during the House of Commons Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration's study on strengthening the protection of women in our immigration system, most witnesses insisted that newcomers must be informed, in their language of origin, and before coming to Canada, of their rights in Canada and about the resources available to them in Canada. The committee recommended in its report to the House:</ParaText><ParaText id="4158256"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">... that the Government of Canada expand pre-arrival orientation to ensure sponsored spouses receive information in a language they understand and to ensure that the topics covered include gender equality, women's rights, their legal rights, what constitutes abuse in Canada and how to seek help. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158257">However, no funds were earmarked in the 2015 budget to implement this recommendation. </ParaText><ParaText id="4158258">Here is another example of the government ignoring expertise and forgoing data and information and in so doing putting people at risk, sacrificing vulnerable people on the altar of political expediency. I call it political expediency quite deliberately, because the truth here is that so much of what is in the bill actually duplicates existing laws. </ParaText><ParaText id="4158259">For example, the bill would amend the Civil Marriage Act to make free and enlightened consent legal requirements for marriage, but these requirements already exist as part of the civil code of Quebec and of common law in other provinces. The bill would limit the defence of provocation, ostensibly to exclude honour killings, but the courts have already ruled that the concept of honour and a culturally driven sense of what is an appropriate response does not count as provocation under the Criminal Code. The Canadian Criminal Code also already provides recourse that is relevant in most cases involving forced marriages, prior to and after marriage, as well as in cases of travelling with minors with the intent of forcing them to marry.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158260">There is a broad range of existing Criminal Code provisions on everything from intimidation to forceful confinement to sexual assault that deal with these issues already.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158261">So much of what we are talking about here today in this House stands as so fully representative of the four years of the 41st Parliament and the style and substance of the current Conservative government. It takes complex social issues, with real victims, and responds the only way it seems to know how, with its reflex to criminalization without regard to evidence, experience, expertise, or the potential of the unintended consequences of its reflex. </ParaText><ParaText id="4158262">Witness its response to the over 1,200 missing and murdered indigenous women: no inquiry, no search for intelligence or understanding, just criminalize, as though that helps victims, as though that will somehow prevent having more victims.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158263">With so few days left in the 41st Parliament, this elected chamber is here considering a bill put forward by a chamber of unelected people. We have a Conservative government giving priority or ceding priority to an ill-considered, reactionary, and potentially harmful bill from the unelected Senate while at the same time it is shutting down debate in this elected chamber, as it has done 100 times already, as has been the fate of nearly 60 bills to date, on matters that elected representatives of this chamber want to debate.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158264">In all, what a fitting way for the current government to close out the final days of this Parliament, and what an unfortunate way for Canada and Canadians.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Vaughan" id="8749382"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="207341" Type="2">Mr. Adam Vaughan (Trinity—Spadina, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4158265">Mr. Speaker, I listened with care to my colleague's speech. I am struggling to find in this bill something that is not already illegal. It is almost like we are making it illegal twice because we hate it so much. In doing so, we are ignoring what I think is the real cruelty in the government's current legislation with respect to marriage, in particular marriage that spans the globe, which is that families have had their separation extended from 11 months to 29 months almost arbitrarily.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158266">I was in a restaurant on Queen Street, in my riding, when a young chef came out from the back of the fast-food restaurant and said, “What happened? My spouse was told that she would have to wait 11 months to come to this country. I just checked the website, and it is 29 months.”</ParaText><ParaText id="4158267"> I am not very familiar with the cultural customs on the Barbary Coast from 1,500 years ago, but it seems to me like a cruel practice to make young people suffer like that, yet that is legal in this country. Yet all the steps in this bill simply make what is illegal already illegal twice. It is like the Conservatives like it so much they thought that doing it twice would make it even more of a vice.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Kellway" id="8749384"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170669" Type="2">Mr. Matthew Kellway</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4158268">Mr. Speaker, it is certainly a habit the current government has of not paying attention to the criminal provisions that already exist in the Canadian Criminal Code across a broad range of issues. The Conservatives put forth legislation in this House that duplicates existing provisions, as though these things are not already taken care of. What is most problematic is not just the reflex to criminalization but the insensitivity to the fact that when they deal with matters of family and social relations through criminalization or immigration only, they are inevitably catching in their web family issues and are doing harm to families.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158269">At committee, there were experts talking about this issue. For example, Dr. Hannana Siddiqui, head of policy and research at Southall Black Sisters in London, the United Kingdom, said:</ParaText><ParaText id="4158270"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Anything that you introduce around immigration is not going to affect just the perpetrator but the whole family—the women and children in that polygamous relationship; and that can have a detrimental effect on them as well.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4158271">According to Avvy Go, director of the Metro Toronto Chinese and Southeast Asian Legal Clinic, the bill seeks to deport people who are engaged in polygamy, and that would include the very women the government claims to be trying to protect. These are the unintended consequences and the insensitivities I talked about in my speech.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Gravelle" id="8749389"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170294" Type="2">Mr. Claude Gravelle (Nickel Belt, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4158272">Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170669" Type="2">Beaches—East York</Affiliation> for his wonderful speech on this matter. I would appreciate it if the member for Beaches—East York could tell us a bit about the amendments that were suggested by the NDP at committee, which were rejected.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Kellway" id="8749391"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170669" Type="2">Mr. Matthew Kellway</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4158273">Mr. Speaker, the member will recall that at second reading, the NDP actually put forward a motion in response to this bill. It was rejected. It was a comprehensive motion that was intended to capture a whole bunch of issues that this bill, in its reflex to criminalization, did not capture. The issues dealt with the need for support for families and for social services.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158274">Repeatedly we see that these things are not dealt with by the government. It is a bill that is missing, for example, the social support required by people caught up in a web of domestic violence. It omits, for example, as UNICEF has called for, educational support and mental health services for people who are caught in these circumstances. </ParaText><ParaText id="4158275">Most critically, and we hear this time and again, this is a bill that is missing anything on affordable housing. We had a budget tabled not long ago by the current government that was missing the same thing. Affordable housing is cited by many as the single most important factor in permitting women and children to escape circumstances of domestic violence and abuse. There is nothing in the Conservative budget to deal with affordable housing. There is nothing to deal with that practical response here in this bill. The amendments proposed by the NDP are intended to build into this bill some of those critical supports for people caught in these cultural practices.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Eglinski" id="8749396"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="208785" Type="2">Mr. Jim Eglinski (Yellowhead, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4158276">Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this debate on Bill <Document DbId="6761928" Type="3">S-7</Document>, the zero tolerance for barbaric cultural practices act. This bill proposes to amend the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the Civil Marriage Act and the Criminal Code. The amendments proposed in Bill <Document DbId="6761928" Type="3">S-7</Document> would provide more protection and support for vulnerable individuals, most especially women and children.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158277">The passage of Bill <Document DbId="6761928" Type="3">S-7</Document> would render permanent and temporary residents inadmissible if they practice polygamy in Canada. It would strengthen Canadian marriage laws by establishing a new national minimum age for marriage of 16 years and by codifying the existing legal requirements for free and enlightened consent for marriage and for ending an existing marriage prior to entering another. It would criminalize certain conduct related to underage and forced marriage ceremonies, including the act of removing a child from Canada for the purpose of such marriages. It would help protect potential victims of underage or forced marriages by creating a new specific court-ordered peace bond where there are grounds to fear someone would commit an offence in this area and ensure that the defence of provocation could not be used in so-called honour killings and many spousal homicides.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158278">Undertaking these measures would support the government's throne speech commitment to ensure that barbaric cultural practices do not occur on Canadian soil. Women seeking better lives for themselves and their families in Canada should never be subject to constant fear and threat of violence or death simply for living their lives and pursuing better opportunities for themselves. Practices that include early and forced marriages, polygamy and any so-called honour-based violence run counter to Canadian values and democratic norms. They often contravene basic human rights, especially subjecting women and girls to brutal and inhumane treatment.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158279">The negative impacts these practices have on families and society in general range from influencing immigration outcomes to reducing opportunities for integration and success while also limiting the free choice of vulnerable women and children. We know that there are additional barriers for immigrant and newcomer women and girls who wish to protect themselves and seek help. We want to ensure that help and protection is available if and when they need it.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158280">I would like to speak on one specific measure proposed by Bill <Document DbId="6761928" Type="3">S-7</Document>. I would like to focus the remainder of my time on the provision that aims to augment tools that currently exist to counter the practice of polygamy.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158281">As we know, polygamy has been illegal in Canada for 125 years. For many years we have recognized in this country that this practice is an affront to Canadian values. Polygamist marriages are not legally valid in Canada and are currently prohibited in the Criminal Code. As well, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act already specifies that polygamist spouses cannot be sponsored.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158282">When he upheld Canada's criminal law ban on the practice of polygamy, the hon. Chief Justice Bauman of British Columbia's Supreme Court recognized the physical, psychological and social harms associated with the practice of polygamist marriage. For these reasons, it remains against the criminal law in Canada to practice polygamy or to enter into a polygamist union.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158283">While the responsibility for the prosecution of most crimes, including polygamy, rests with the provincial attorneys general, the prohibition in the Criminal Code upheld in 2011 is the responsibility of this Parliament. In turn, this Parliament and the Government of Canada also have jurisdiction over immigration laws and their enforcement. Since polygamy does occur in some countries from which Canada draws immigrants, we need to ensure that our immigration system has the necessary tools to counter it. Bill <Document DbId="6761928" Type="3">S-7</Document> would give us these additional tools.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4158284">Bill <Document DbId="6761928" Type="3">S-7</Document> would create a new ground of inadmissibility in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act for practising polygamy, increasing our ability to prevent polygamy from occurring on Canadian soil and ensuring that the immigration system is not enabling this practice in any way.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158285">The bill would give immigration officers enhanced tools with which to render both temporary and permanent residents inadmissible for practising polygamy. The new inadmissibility would mean that those in polygamous marriages abroad wanting to enter Canada on a temporary basis would only be able to enter this country alone, without their spouses. Those who cease to practise polygamy would, of course, no longer be inadmissible.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158286">It also means that permanent residents found to be practising polygamy could lose their status and be removed from Canada on that basis alone. Further, we would no longer need a criminal conviction or a finding of misrepresentation in order to begin removal proceedings.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158287">We know that more needs to be done to protect women and girls in our immigration system, despite all of our government's best efforts and intentions. That is why it is so important that the measures in Bill <Document DbId="6761928" Type="3">S-7</Document>, including the additional measures I have discussed regarding polygamy, are enacted. If passed, they would strengthen our laws to protect Canadians and newcomers to Canada from barbaric cultural practices.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158288">This bill sends a clear message to anyone coming to Canada that such practices are not acceptable and run counter to our principles of freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law. The zero tolerance for barbaric cultural practices act stands up for immigrant women and girls who have come to Canada for a better life and better opportunities, ensuring that they have every chance to succeed and make their own choices about the way they want to live their lives.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158289">As legislators, it is our responsibility to prevent those practices that abuse vulnerable women and children, such as polygamy, from happening on our Canadian soil. By ensuring the passage into law of the zero tolerance for barbaric cultural practices act, we will be taking a major step towards the goal by increasing the Government of Canada's ability to prevent polygamy from occurring in this country.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158290">I strongly encourage all members to join me in supporting Bill <Document DbId="6761928" Type="3">S-7</Document>.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We are both members of the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration, so we participated in the same study. I am surprised that he did not talk about the many expert witnesses who expressed concerns about Bill <Document DbId="6761928" Type="3">S-7</Document>. Maybe he remembers that everyone, including all of the witnesses who appeared before the committee, agreed with the intent of the bill, which is to protect women. However, the debate actually centred on aspects of the bill that could put some victims at risk and make them even more vulnerable.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158292">Experts on the ground who work with these victims every day told the committee to be careful because this could discourage victims from seeking help or result in women being deported or fearing deportation if they report their husband.

Under our Constitution, it is within provincial and territorial jurisdiction to make the determination of “independent marriage age”. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158346">Under our Constitution, it is the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada to determine the age below which no minor may legally marry, sometimes called the “absolute minimum age for marriage”. Right now in Canadian law, federal legislation specifies that age 16 is the absolute minimum age for marriage only for the purposes of the law in the province of Quebec. Elsewhere in Canada, because there is no federal legislation, the common law still applies and it is usually interpreted as an absolute minimum age for girls of 12 and for boys of 14. </ParaText><ParaText id="4158347">The other issue I wanted to touch on is concern that the bill has no definition of “practising polygamy”. One witness before the Committee referred to the decision of the British Columbia Supreme Court in the Polygamy Reference case and suggested that it did not determine the meaning. This is incorrect. </ParaText><ParaText id="4158348">There was disagreement before the court on the correct interpretation of the Criminal Code polygamy offence, but Justice Bauman clearly indicated that polygamy was a form of marriage involving more than two people, and included legal marriages, as well as “purported forms of marriage”, meaning religious marriages that were not recognized in law, but where the parties believe they were bound together. He further accepted the Attorney General of Canada's argument that “marriage” was a form of union that is dependent on an event, a ceremony of some kind that sanctions a union of individuals. It is absolutely clear that polygamy does not include common law relationships or other informal relationships, such as polyamory or affairs.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158349">All of the evidence presented demonstrated the harms, both to individuals and to society, of multi-party marriage. These harms of polygamy caused Justice Bauman to find the prohibition against polygamy constitutional .</ParaText><ParaText id="4158350">Clear guidance with respect to the meaning of "practising polygamy" will be provided to front-line immigration officials.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158351"> Another witness suggested that only the man was practising polygamy because of his union with more than one spouse, but that the women in a polygamous union should not be included because their union was to only one spouse. This suggestion, while I am sure well-meaning, completely defies logic. </ParaText><ParaText id="4158352">The final point I want to make concerns another confusion. Some have suggested that a person who is married to someone and either does not know that the person is already married to someone else, or who is forced into that marriage, would be considered to be practising polygamy. This is completely untrue. Under the Criminal Code, a person who has no actual knowledge that he or she are in a polygamous union, or a person who was forced into such a union, has not behaved in a morally blameworthy manner, which is the cornerstone of the criminal law. If a person is unaware of relevant facts, or has been compelled to act, he or she is not guilty of a criminal offence. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158353">Bill <Document DbId="6761928" Type="3">S-7</Document> would protect young people from early marriages by enacting a new, national, absolute minimum age for marriage that would apply to all marriages performed in Canada, and to all marriages performed outside of Canada that involved young people ordinarily resident here. This is an important protection for all our young people. I have been told of instances where young people are excused from classes to be married by telephone at age 12 and 13. That will no longer be possible once the bill receives royal assent. </ParaText><ParaText id="4158354"> The bill would also give young people the ability to tell their parents that they could not be forced to marry someone they did not want to marry because it was against the law. It would give young people the ability to ask for a court order to take their passports from their parents if they were afraid they may be taken out of the country to marry.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158355">These are important changes in the law to protect vulnerable youth until they are old enough to better know their own minds. Marriage is hard enough, and young married couples will face many challenges without adding to them the burden of marrying too young or marrying someone they do not wish to marry. </ParaText>

During these fishing periods, recreational fishers are permitted to catch up to 5 groundfish per day, including cod. However, the maximum boat limit when three or more people are fishing is 15 groundfish. There is no requirement for licence or tags, and the fishery is open to both resident and non-resident recreational fishers. Fishing is only permitted using angling gear and handlines with a maximum of three hooks. Retention of Atlantic halibut, northern and spotted wolffish, and any species of shark is prohibited.

Prior to question period, I talked about some of the issues that were involved with the bill. I want to speak now about what is ahead of us on family matters.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158731"> I would refer the House to a <I>Globe and Mail</I> article this morning that talked about a Nanos poll. Nanos indicates:</ParaText><ParaText id="4158732"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">When asked which federal party was most trusted to help Canadian families, 34 per cent of the poll’s respondents picked the NDP. That compared with the 27 per cent who chose the Liberals and the 26 per cent who chose the Conservatives.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4158733">This speaks directly to the problems with this bill. The Conservatives have proposed an approach on marriage, a part of the family cycle that is so valuable to everyone. They proposed changes to it without consultation with the provinces and territories, putting forward an idea that really does not accomplish much. The laws of duress are already in place. Other countries that have established similar laws have shown no results from them.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158734">What the NDP would do for families and for women to deal with violence was very clearly articulated by the member for <Affiliation DbId="170756" Type="2">Churchill</Affiliation> when she put forward Motion No. 444. It was a motion to establish a coordinated national action plan to address violence against women. Part of that would be strategies that address the specific needs and vulnerabilities of different communities, including specific attention to aboriginal women, women with disabilities, women from minority groups, and young women.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158735">What we proposed in our national action plan was to get to the bottom of the issues surrounding groups such as those. Certainly the ideas that the Conservatives are concerned about and would deal with by criminalizing forced marriages would be dealt with inside a framework that would look for actual solutions to the problems rather than by criminalizing those engaged in it, and criminalizing them in a very broad and capricious way that really does not allow for definition or for any kind of rational action on that part.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158736"> I think this is really important, as it comes on the heels of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's report, which followed many groups in society by asking for an inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women. </ParaText><ParaText id="4158737">Violence against women is one of the biggest and most pressing problems that we have with families in this country, and the need for that public inquiry is so important. Why is it so important? The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said that this is not a social issue. Of course it is a social issue, much as forced marriages are a social issue. All of these are social issues that need to be dealt with in a respectful, responsible fashion. We need to get to the bottom of the issues in society that create the conditions that lead to violence and forced marriages and all of the things that all of us in this House today would not want to have happen in our families, in aboriginal families, or in minority group families. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158738">Yes, we are concerned about it, but using retail politics to put forward a bill that does nothing except provide a title to an issue is really the wrong approach. That is why the polling results that we see today across this country with respect to who the Canadian population trusts to deal with issues for families are so revealing. We talk about real ways to come to grips with society's ills. That is not through legislation; that is through careful, enunciated conditions that arise out of a careful examination of the issues.</ParaText>

They have no place here in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158755">In his appearance before the Standing Senate Committee on Human Rights on the bill, the <Affiliation DbId="194611" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship and Immigration</Affiliation> made it clear that any practice that involves violence directed at women is barbaric. I think if we asked most Canadians across this country, especially women, they would agree with that statement. </ParaText><ParaText id="4158756">The measures in the bill would help vulnerable women and children in a number of ways. </ParaText><ParaText id="4158757">First, it would strengthen Canadian marriage laws by establishing a new national minimum age for marriage of 16 years old, and by codifying the existing legal requirements for free and enlightened consent for marriage and for ending an existing marriage prior to entering another. </ParaText>

Provincial and territorial legislation set out certain ages for additional requirements, such as parental consent for those under the age of majority, or court approval for even younger children. However, they lack the constitutional jurisdiction to set the absolute minimum age below which no child can marry. Again, it is lacking.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158762">Federal law currently sets the absolute minimum age at 16 years old, but only in Quebec. In other parts of Canada, the common law applies because there is no federal legislation. The common law minimum age causes uncertainty. It is usually interpreted as a minimum of 12 years of age for girls and 14 years of age for boys. That is 12 for girls, and 14 for boys.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158763">Amending the Civil Marriage Act to set a national minimum age of 16 years old for marriage would make it clear that underage marriage is unacceptable in Canada and will not be tolerated. Even though, in practice, very few marriages in Canada now involve people under the age of 16, it is important that we clarify the law.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158764">Other significant amendments to the Civil Marriage Act proposed in Bill <Document DbId="6761928" Type="3">S-7</Document> include codifying the requirement that those getting married must give their free and enlightened consent to marry each other. The amendments would codify the requirement for the dissolution of any previous marriage as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158765">Continuing on from proposed amendments to the Civil Marriage Act, Bill <Document DbId="6761928" Type="3">S-7</Document> also contains measures that would amend the Criminal Code to help deter and prevent forced or underage marriage. These measures would criminalize knowingly officiating at an underage or forced marriage; actively participating in a wedding ceremony, knowing that one party is marrying another against his or her will or is under 16 years old; and removing a minor from Canada for a forced or underage marriage.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158766">There is also a new peace bond, which would give courts the power to impose conditions on an individual when there are reasonable grounds to fear that a forced marriage, or a marriage under the age of 16, would otherwise occur. The ways such a peace bond could be used to prevent an underage or forced marriage include requiring the surrender of a passport and preventing a child from being taken out of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158767">This is important for young women, women across this country, and for our children. It would help to prevent family members from taking them out of the country to be forcibly married, without being placed in the difficult situation of requiring individual women or girls to press criminal charges against another family member. </ParaText><ParaText id="4158768"> All of the provisions in Bill <Document DbId="6761928" Type="3">S-7</Document>, including those that address underage and forced marriage, would help to ensure that women and girls are protected from isolation and violence. </ParaText>

The first is the lens of unintended consequences, because when we present legislation, we need to think about what the consequences will be. Sometimes there are unintended consequences, and there are a lot in this bill. The second lens I want to apply is what we would do if we actually wanted to stop forced marriages. What kind of legislation or policy could we bring forward if we were really serious about putting an end to underage marriages in Canada? I will talk about those two things, because the NDP is very serious about bringing forward legislation and policy that can put an end to underage marriage and put an end to forced marriages. </ParaText><ParaText id="4158792">First though, I want to tackle the issue of the title. We heard a little bit of a back and forth between my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170821" Type="2">Northwest Territories</Affiliation> and the parliamentary secretary about the title.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158793"> The title of this bill is the <Document DbId="6761928" Type="3">zero tolerance for barbaric cultural practices act</Document>. I have a big problem with this title. The parliamentary secretary stood here, wrung her hands, implored us to think of the children, and asked if this was not a barbaric cultural practice. We all agree that these are terrible practices. However, when we have this kind of provocative title it is not about working together to eliminate this kind of behaviour or these practices. What this title does is fuel racist stereotypes. It creates xenophobia toward very particular groups in Canada. We are targeting particular groups with this title.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158794">I think about the other barbaric cultural practices happening in this country. Why are the Conservatives not standing up against other barbaric cultural practices? I happen to think it is a barbaric cultural practice that a woman who is raped and becomes pregnant is forced to carry that baby to term because she cannot access abortion services in this country. I happen to think it is a barbaric cultural practice, yet I do not see the Conservatives standing up and fighting for that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158795">I happen to think it is a barbaric cultural practice to force a woman to bring a baby to term if she does not want to have that baby, but we do not see the Conservatives crusading to change the fact that only 16% of hospitals in Canada offer abortion services. They are not champions on the lack of access to abortion services in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158796">I think it is a barbaric cultural act that we have created a culture that puts such shame on women. It shames them to the point that they will do anything to terminate a pregnancy without having to tell someone, like throwing themselves down the stairs, taking drugs to self-abort, and using coat hangers. I happen to think this is a barbaric cultural practice, yet I hear silence in the House about putting an end to that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158797">In Prince Edward Island, a woman took medication to induce an abortion and had a complication. She went to the ER. She was bleeding. She did not know if she was bleeding to death. She had no idea. She waited for five hours in the ER. When someone actually came in to talk to her about what was going on, the attending health care provider told her that he was not comfortable treating her and that she should go to Halifax. Halifax is not down the street. Halifax is 300 kilometres away. I happen to think it is a barbaric cultural practice to have left that woman in that ER for five hours, not knowing about the health or the state of her fetus, not knowing about her own health, and not knowing if she was going to bleed to death and then having the doctor say that he was not comfortable treating her.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158798"> I happen to think that was a barbaric cultural practice, yet I do not see the Conservatives standing up to enforce the Canada Health Act to ensure that we have equal access to health services across this country. Come to think of it, I do not see any of the Liberals standing up to talk about this either. It is a Liberal government in P.E.I. There are three Liberal MPs here in the House of Commons, and we have a whole lot of silence when it comes to standing up for women's rights and their ability to access abortion services.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4158799">Moving on, let us get back to unintended consequences.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158800">If we are serious about putting an end to these practices, then let us look at how we do it. Let us draft some legislation and think about what the consequences are, both intended and unintended. Unfortunately, there are a lot of unintended consequences here.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158801"> We have heard several of my colleagues talk about these unintended consequences. I think they are really serious. I think they are so serious that we cannot support the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158802">There is something as simple as the definition of polygamy. There is no real definition of polygamy here. We might think we all know what polygamy is, so what is the big deal? Well, it is a big deal. We are playing with people's lives here. We need a definition.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158803">We heard testimony at committee about what would happen if there was a legally sanctioned marriage and one that was not legally sanctioned. For example, a person is married, the partners split up, and the person gets into a common-law relationship. If that first relationship has not been legally terminated and that person is in a new common-law relationship, is that polygamy? We do not know. What may be perceived as a small detail could have serious consequences for all kinds of people in Canada who might not know that they are in a polygamous relationship.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158804"> However, this is a small detail that I can maybe even wrap my head around, but there are other unintended consequences that are beyond the pale. </ParaText><ParaText id="4158805">If we are trying to help marginalized and disadvantaged women, then we cannot put them in situations where they are so fearful that they cannot come forward. We heard tons of expert testimony about this. It is actually shocking when we look at the transcripts from committee how passionate some of these witnesses were about the fact that this legislation would drive those women deeper underground. If we want to help these women and children, we cannot have them be fearful that they will be deported.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158806">Imagine if this deportation happened. It would not be just for the big bad guy we are always talking about, the one who is forcing a little girl into marriage. I heard the minister talk about forced rape for the rest of her life. If that little girl does not know she can get protection from our government, why would she come forward? If there are laws that say that everyone involved in a polygamous marriage will be deported, that will include that little girl. How does it help that little girl to send her to another country where there are no protections, where there probably are not even opportunities for her to go to school? </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158807">How about we put an end to that kind of barbaric cultural practice? Imagine sending a little girl out of the country when all she wants is protection. That is an unintended consequence I cannot get past. The legislation before us is full of these unintended consequences.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158808"> I will skip to how we can work together. We had some really good testimony at committee about how we need to have institutional support for these victims. We can have that kind of support without alienating and harming the women who are involved in forced marriage and gender-based violence. We need to have those institutional supports for them.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158809">UNICEF talks a lot about the fact that if we are going to protect children from human trafficking, we have to recognize the failures in the system that allow those women and children to be trafficked. We have to recognize that they often come from low-income families without access to community support, without access to settlement services, and without access to people in the community they can turn to about their situation to ask for help.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158810">If we were serious, we could get together, sit down, scrap Bill S-7, and start over. We would come to the table and talk about what would help these women and children and what kinds of supports we could give them. I do not think deporting them is exactly what we had in mind when we thought we wanted to put an end polygamy, underage marriage, and forced marriage in this country. I do not think that is the right solution. I think if we took our partisan hats off for a minute, many of us would come to that conclusion.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

During my speech, I would like to highlight the provisions of the bill that are designed to protect Canadian children from early and forced marriage. </ParaText><ParaText id="4158826">Although we lack national statistics on the incidence of early and forced marriage among children in Canada because these practices are kept hidden, there are indications that children in Canada are in fact subjected to the barbaric practices of early and forced marriage. According to the South Asian Legal Clinic of Ontario's study on forced marriages, in Ontario between 2010 and 2012, 10% of the 219 victims identified were between the ages of 12 and 15 and 25% were between the ages of 16 and 18. </ParaText><ParaText id="4158827">International studies have shown that girls are predominantly the victims of a child marriage, increasing their risk of being exposed to violence and complications in childbirth and creating a significant barrier to achieving gender equality, as they are regularly forced to disrupt or abandon their education.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158828">A number of witnesses testified during the committee's hearings about the very disturbing cases of girls in Canada who had been forced to marry or who had been taken abroad to get married, despite their young age or lack of consent. In some instances, young girls are tricked into leaving the country, supposedly to attend a wedding ceremony of a relative, only to discover that the wedding is their own.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158829">While there are currently some legislative tools available in Canada to prevent and respond to underage and forced marriages of children, there are some significant gaps in the law that Bill <Document DbId="6761928" Type="3">S-7</Document> aims to fill. </ParaText><ParaText id="4158830">First, there is currently no national minimum age below which children are not legally capable of consenting to marriage. In Canada, the free age of marriage—the age at which children become adults and can give consent to marry on their own, with no additional requirements—is 18 or 19 years of age, depending on the province or territory where the marriage takes place.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158831">All provincial and territorial marriage acts set out additional requirements for minors to marry, such as parental consent, a court order, or proof of pregnancy. Under the Constitution, setting the absolute minimum age for marriage is a matter of federal jurisdiction. However, apart from federal legislation that sets the minimum age of 16 years for marriages in Quebec, the minimum age elsewhere in Canada is set out in the common law, or court decisions. This old common law sets the minimum age at 14 for boys and 12 for girls. There is no clear minimum age across the country setting the absolute minimum age.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158832">Bill <Document DbId="6761928" Type="3">S-7</Document> would enact changes to the Civil Marriage Act that would effectively prevent marriage of any person under the age of 16 from occurring anywhere in Canada. This will close the current legislative gap and set a national minimum age for marriage across Canada that would be consistent with countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. Further, by making all children under age 16 legally incapable of consenting to marriage, Bill <Document DbId="6761928" Type="3">S-7</Document> would also ensure that if a child is taken out of Canada and married in a country where such child marriages are legal, upon the child's return to Canada, the underage marriage would be voidable because the child lacked the legal capacity to marry.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158833">Bill <Document DbId="6761928" Type="3">S-7</Document> would amend the Criminal Code to provide criminal protections against underage and forced marriages. The new provisions are directed to the public sanctioning of an underage and forced marriage ceremony, which creates an unwanted and harmful legal bond within which sexual offences are expected to occur.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158834">The two new offences would criminalize conduct related to knowingly officiating or knowingly and actively participating in a marriage ceremony in which one or both of the spouses is either under the age of 16 or marrying against their will. While a person will not be prosecuted for just being a guest at the wedding, those who conduct the marriage ceremony and those, including family members, who actively engage in conduct directed at facilitating the underage or forced marriage ceremony with full knowledge that one party is underage or marrying against his or her will may be criminally liable.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158835">In keeping with the objective of the criminal law to deter people from committing crimes, these new provisions send a clear and important message about the need for all Canadians to reject the misguided belief that any underage or forced marriage can be in a child's best interest.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4158836">As well, the bill would make it an offence to remove a child from Canada for the purposes of a forced or underage marriage ceremony outside of Canada. It would build upon an existing provision in the Criminal Code that makes it an offence to remove a child for the purposes of committing certain crimes, such as child sexual offences and female genital mutilation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158837">Bill <Document DbId="6761928" Type="3">S-7</Document> would add the new offences related to officiating or actively participating in an underage or forced marriage ceremony to the list of offences in the existing provision. This would effectively punish those who attempt to, or who do, remove a child from Canada for the purposes of an underage or forced marriage ceremony abroad. It should also serve to prevent these removals from taking place at all because it would allow officials to intervene before the child left the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158838">Without this amendment, the current law requires authorities to have evidence that a sexual offence is intended to be committed abroad following the marriage. With the amendment, evidence of an intended forced or early marriage will enable preventive measures to be taken.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158839">I want to take this opportunity to respond to comments that I have heard many times about how child victims of forced marriages are reluctant to contact the authorities prior to the marriage because they do not want their parents or other relatives prosecuted.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158840">The Criminal Code amendments in Bill <Document DbId="6761928" Type="3">S-7</Document> that I have just noted would provide the foundation for a very important prevention measure. Bill <Document DbId="6761928" Type="3">S-7</Document> would provide for specific forced or underage marriage peace bonds, which would provide courts with the power to impose conditions on an individual when there were reasonable grounds to fear that a forced or underage marriage would otherwise occur.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158841">For example, an order under the new peace bond provision could prevent a victim from being taken out of Canada or require the surrender of a passport. These peace bonds are available to victims who want protection but do not want their parents or other relatives prosecuted. People subjected to peace bonds are not charged with a criminal offence unless they breach the conditions of the order.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158842">It is important to point out that a third party, such as a social worker, a police officer or a relative, can intervene to request the peace bond on the child's behalf. </ParaText><ParaText id="4158843">It is important that everyone know and understand that this conduct is illegal because it is the most vulnerable in our society, our children, who suffer serious harm when forced, usually by their family members, to marry underage or against their will. How can we not do everything possible to stop this?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158844">Our government is taking steps to strengthen the laws to help to ensure that no young girl or woman in Canada becomes a victim of early or forced marriage, polygamy, so-called honour-based violence or any other form of harmful cultural practices.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158845">I am proud to support the zero tolerance for barbaric cultural practices act.

I would really like to talk about that aspect in particular. However, first, I would like to mention a few little things that are directly related to the Conservative government's proposal and the work that my colleagues on this side of the House have done on Bill <Document DbId="6761928" Type="3">S-7</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158861">To begin, I would like to thank my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170188" Type="2">Pierrefonds—Dollard</Affiliation>, our immigration critic, who did an incredible job examining Bill <Document DbId="6761928" Type="3">S-7</Document>. I saw the work that she did in committee and the amendments that she wants to propose. She has my full support for the amendments she wants to make to improve Bill S-7, as it now stands.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158862">First of all, I have to say that I support the intent of the bill, which seeks to combat polygamy and forced and underage marriage. I also recognize that any violence against women and children is completely unacceptable and that there is still a lot of work to be done to prevent and crack down on these crimes.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158863">However, I remain convinced that this bill does not adequately respond to such serious problems. In fact, Bill <Document DbId="6761928" Type="3">S-7</Document> could make existing problems worse. It is important to mention that no woman should be subjected to gender-based violence, and that includes forced and underage marriage. This bill could inadvertently have very serious consequences for women and children by putting more social pressure on the victims of forced marriage and deporting victims of polygamy, for example.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158864">If, as they often say, the Conservatives really care about the victims, they will heed the warnings of the different experts who appeared before the committee and conduct more detailed studies before adopting measures such as the ones proposed here. Instead of focusing on such a sensationalistic bill, with the short title proposed by the Conservatives, a bill that does not address the root of the problem, I sincerely believe that the <Affiliation DbId="194611" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship and Immigration</Affiliation> should conduct serious, large-scale consultations with community groups and experts to fix the real problem of sexual violence.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158865">There are a number of things that the government could do to help women who are marginalized. Despite the fact that the number of women MPs in the House of Commons has reached a record high, women have a long way to go to achieve equal representation. However, I hope we will steadily approach that target as more women stand for office. Nonetheless, there are different measures that the government could adopt to help women throughout the world take an interest in politics—whether municipal, provincial or federal—and in changing laws to meet their needs. We know that when more women hold power, the laws and approaches are very different. Problems are solved by women for women. It has been shown that it is very positive to have a parliament composed of 50% or more women. This leads to changes in the bills that are introduced.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158866">This is an extremely sensationalistic bill, and I deplore that. I sincerely hope that my colleagues on the other side of the House will take the time to examine the amendments put forward by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170188" Type="2">Pierrefonds—Dollard</Affiliation>, who simply wants to bring some common sense to this bill. Once again, I still believe in and have a lot of faith in this Parliament, and that will not stop. I sincerely believe that we can work together.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4158867">The House of Commons has committees to study bills with various experts, such as community leaders and experts in general law, civil law or immigration. </ParaText><ParaText id="4158868">These experts did not have harsh words, but they did share some concerns. On this side of the House I would say that we did some worthwhile work with the proposals made by the experts and others invited to the committee. We took their ideas to try to improve this bill, because what we have been trying to propose all along is common sense. However, the concrete measures set out in Bill <Document DbId="6761928" Type="3">S-7</Document> will unfortunately not have the desired impact.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158869">I am making a heartfelt plea to the <Affiliation DbId="194611" Type="4">Minister of Immigration</Affiliation> today. I ask him to consider these amendments, eliminate the sensationalistic and partisan aspects of this bill, and bring some common sense to this bill. A real consultation on Bill S-7 is needed.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158870">From what I read of the testimony, there was a lack of consultation. I would like to quote a statement by Action Canada for Sexual Rights and Health:</ParaText><ParaText id="4158871"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> The bill reflects a lack of consultation (closed-door meetings and invitation-only consultations), and a lack of transparency, participation and public debate. The proposed amendments are not based on the experiences of women and girls who have survived acts of violence, such as forced marriage. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="4158872">That is pretty serious testimony about the lack of consultation. I sincerely believe that if a bill purports to help women and children across Canada in terms of forced marriage and violence against women, it should include real solutions to help them. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158873">All members of the House are very familiar with the organizations in their ridings and the incredible work they do. In Laval, many organizations work to help women in various ways. They might be active in politics, encouraging women to run for office and participate actively in elections. Organizations also help women who are often in need. One that comes to mind is the Table de concertation de Laval en condition féminine. Many of my colleagues on this side of the House also have Afeas in their ridings. I see my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170220" Type="2">Laval—Les Îles</Affiliation> nodding. That organization is very visible in my riding; I am speaking for both of us. Afeas is very visible in Laval. Its goal is to help women, help them escape marginalization and misery, and ensure that women have the same rights as men across the country. So much needs to be done.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158874">I see that my time is almost up, but I would like to comment briefly on what could be done to help women across the country. It is not necessarily just what is being put forward in Bill <Document DbId="6761928" Type="3">S-7</Document>. There are a lot of things we could do to help women in different communities.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158875">When I asked my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170380" Type="2">Halifax</Affiliation> a question, I mentioned the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, which recently submitted its report and 94 recommendations. I think the federal government has a role to play in about a good third of the recommendations. It could do something about the issue of murdered and missing indigenous women all across Canada. It should have done something about that issue a long time ago. I truly believe that if the government really wanted to help murdered and missing indigenous women and their families, it would do something.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158876">A number of other subjects could have been addressed to end the marginalization of women. Two examples that come to mind are pay equity and women's leadership on corporate boards, whether public or private. Something really meaningful could have been done.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158877">Regarding Bill <Document DbId="6761928" Type="3">S-7</Document>, I have to point out again that we could make it better. It is not too late. The NDP has proposed some amendments. I still hope that the Conservatives will agree to compromise a little, ensure that these amendments are incorporated into the bill and put an end to all the smoke and mirrors. In the end, that is all that Bill S-7 really is.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Today, we are basically talking about the fees that businesses are charged by credit card companies when consumers make purchases.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158907">In Canada, the processing fee for credit card payments varies between 1.5% and 4% of the purchase price. In 2012, retailers paid $832 million in credit card charges. This is significant, and it is quite a staggering amount for our small business people. </ParaText><ParaText id="4158908">In 2009, the NDP moved a motion in the House asking the Government of Canada to put in place a binding law—“binding” is the key word—to protect Canadians against excessive credit card interest rates.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158909">However, although the NDP's motion has the support of many Canadian merchant associations, the government still has not passed binding legislation. Instead, the Conservative government opted for a voluntary code of conduct. We know that this does not work for the major credit card companies.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158910">Motion No. 574, which we are debating today, calls on the government to reduce the burden on businesses and consumers by reducing the transaction fees charged to merchants by credit card companies.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158911">The motion also calls on the government to allow merchants to disclose to the consumer the transaction costs relating to the payment method chosen. This is very important, since consumers are not properly informed. They do not necessarily know that when they use their Visa or MasterCard, the merchant is required to pay exorbitant fees.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158912">Unfortunately there is a lack of awareness. That is why I launched a campaign in my riding of Rivière-des-Mille-Îles in 2013 to talk about these transaction fees.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158913">The NDP wants a law that will set a limit on these transaction fees. We also held consultations across the country to develop a clear position on this. At the time, our consumer protection critic travelled all over the country and organized a number of round tables on the subject. Six recommendations came out of those round tables. I would like to share them with you.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158914"> First, the NDP recommends the development of robust regulations for electronic and mobile payments in order to establish standards and make the rules transparent and fair for all stakeholders, particularly small and medium-sized businesses, entrepreneurs and consumers. </ParaText><ParaText id="4158915">We are also calling on the government to tighten the loopholes in the pre-existing governance structure of the payments system to ensure that processors are not taking advantage of these loopholes to the detriment of Canadian merchants. </ParaText><ParaText id="4158916">We recommend continued support for the Interac payment system, which provides businesses and consumers with a safe, secure and cost-effective means of processing electronic payments in Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="4158917">Very few people know that merchants pay a fixed 12¢ fee for every Interac transaction. That is much lower than the fees they may have to pay when customers pay by credit card.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4158918">We also recommend ordering the public disclosure of the cost per transaction of the merchant discount rate charged to Canadian companies by issuers of credit cards and other methods of payment. These costs affect companies' competitiveness and retail prices. We want consumers to be educated and aware of the practices and fees associated with using these cards.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158919">We also recommend disclosing to consumers at the point of sale the hidden cost to the retailer of the method of payment used.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158920">Lastly, we recommend establishing dispute resolution processes that are more efficient for merchants and take into account how financial institutions' payment processing services work.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158921">I would like to provide a little background on this file and all of the recommendations and observations of the past few years. Seven years ago, in 2008, several retail associations, including the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, the Retail Council of Canada and the Small Business Matters Coalition, launched national lobbying campaigns against the exorbitant merchant fees charged by credit card companies. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158922">In July 2013, the Competition Tribunal of Canada said that the conditions imposed by Visa and MasterCard on Canadian businesses were anti-competitive and that the fees they charged were excessive. The tribunal called on the government to intervene in the market to correct these problems. The government has since reacted by simply introducing a voluntary code for credit card companies, a code that does not work. That is why the Small Business Matters Coalition and most of the small retailers we talked to are dissatisfied with the government's measures. The government must act and take measures to impose binding laws that cap the excessive fees charged to retailers.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158923">The fees paid in Canada are among the highest in the world. The average rate is more than 2% in Canada, whereas it is roughly only 1% in Australia and 0.79% in the United Kingdom. Those countries have taken measures to cap credit card transaction fees. It is therefore possible to regulate the abusive practices of banks. It is done in other countries. Unfortunately, the banks and the oil companies have this majority government in their pockets. That is why the government does not want to do anything about this. Political will is needed to deal with this and on this side of the House, we want to regulate the abusive practices of the banks.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158924">Choosing to not regulate credit card transaction fees is regressive. It only helps those who can afford credit cards that give them rich rewards and very high points. A document published in 2009 by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston estimated that, on average, each cash-using household actually pays $149 to card-using households every year. What is more, because of the demographics of credit card users and those who use cash or debit cards, this is in fact a regressive transfer from poor consumers to rich consumers. If we really want to reduce inequality in Canada, then capping credit card transaction fees is one way to do that. When I go door-knocking in my riding, my constituents also ask me to put a limit on credit card interest rates.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4158925">Political will is needed to protect consumers from the abusive practices of the banks. The NDP will protect consumers when we form the next government of Canada.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Caron" id="8749928"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170671" Type="2">Mr. Guy Caron (Rimouski-Neigette—Témiscouata—Les Basques, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4158926">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak in support of the motion brought forward by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170545" Type="2">Marc-Aurèle-Fortin</Affiliation>, which is very timely. There is a lot of talk these days about standing up for consumers and small and medium-sized businesses. This issue was addressed in the government's throne speech and two most recent budgets. However, the Conservatives are a long way from walking the walk.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158927">The motion addresses an issue that all small and medium-sized businesses in Quebec and Canada really deplore, credit card interchange fees, which are borne by businesses. These fees are extremely high in Canada. They are usually about 1.5%, but they can be as high as 4% in the case of premium credit cards, which allow cardholders to collect points that they can exchange for goods and services. People need to realize that these cards, although beneficial to the cardholder, are largely paid for by merchants themselves and by other consumers. It is basically a brilliant marketing and advertizing strategy thought up by credit card companies. However, at the end of the day, they entail additional fees that are assumed by all consumers and that contribute to price increases.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158928">I say that because in some places outside Canada, whether it be in Australia or even the European Union, a cap has been placed on these fees. In many cases, small businesses have profit margins of 5%, 6% or 7%, which is not very much. When credit card payments eat up between 1.5% and 4% of that profit margin, it becomes very difficult for these small businesses to survive. What other choice do they have? The only other choice is to no longer accept credit cards.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158929">We know full well that in this day and age, refusing to accept credit cards puts businesses at a huge disadvantage because many people use their credit cards for everyday purchases. Refusing to accept credit cards seems to be the only option for these companies, but it is not a realistic one, because obviously, customers who cannot use their credit card and are not in the habit of using a debit card or cash may choose to shop somewhere else.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158930">This motion is very timely because it confirms the official opposition's intention to cap credit card interchange fees. It also confirms our intention to no longer rely solely on the voluntary code that the Conservatives seem so proud of, but to set real restrictions that will benefit all SMEs, merchants and, by extension, consumers.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158931">The government is saying that it has already negotiated with Visa and MasterCard, which are the two major credit card companies, to ensure that they will voluntarily agree to set a limit on interchange fees. However, that is not enough. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business and other businesses and organizations representing small businesses and the business community are still on edge and still do not know when Visa and MasterCard might change their minds and do something to violate this voluntary code.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158932">Instead of a voluntary code, what we really need are federal regulations. We could always discuss how to apply the regulations and their parameters. However, it is clear that the government can play a role in a market such as the credit card market, which is neither free nor competitive, but is a duopoly. Visa and MasterCard control approximately 92% of the market. Even a known quantity like American Express cannot bite into the market share of Visa and Mastercard. When we are faced with a duopoly, there is an imperfect market, a failure of market forces. In that sense, the government is completely justified in intervening to protect the consumer, the industry and business.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4158933">We can look to the regulations, such as these, that have been adopted in other countries. Australia is an interesting example. I am not saying that this is what an NDP government would do, but it does deserve to be studied.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158934">In Australia, the decision to cap interchange fees is made by the Reserve Bank of Australia. It is not up to the federal government to make that decision, which is not a bad thing, but up to the body responsible for the country's monetary policy. This is an interesting approach, and it demonstrates that such regulations or such an approach can be successfully implemented. Our interchange fees vary between 1.5% and 4%, but Australia has managed to decrease its fees significantly.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158935">Elsewhere, the European Union has just adopted regulations that will impose a cap of 0.3% on credit card fees paid by merchants and a cap of 0.5% on debit card fees. We clearly see that there is the political will in Europe to tackle a real situation that penalizes small and medium-sized business.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158936">The European Union just limited this rate to 0.3%, and in 2006, Australia reduced it to 0.5%. Of course, Visa, MasterCard and other credit card companies will say that this will destroy them and that they will not be able to provide efficient service if the market is disrupted like this. That is what they said in Australia to try to halt the efforts of the Australian government. They said that if the government got involved, the consequences would be disastrous.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158937">In reality, credit card use continued to increase after 2006. There was no disruption to Australia's credit card system. The companies adapted. They lowered their costs elsewhere and adapted to their decreased revenues as a result of the Australian government's regulations. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158938">It is clear that we need to do something. The merchants I speak to in my riding are happy with voluntary codes of conduct. However, when I speak to them about the interchange fees they have to pay for using credit cards, the reaction is overwhelming. These fees eat into their profit margin, which is often not very high.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158939">When I speak to them about the NDP's proposal, the motion moved by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="170545" Type="2">Marc-Aurèle-Fortin</Affiliation>, they see a real desire to make meaningful changes. That is the best gift we can give our artists and our merchants, who simply want to provide services in their communities and grow their businesses. However, in order to do so they must be able to set aside this profit margin for future investments, in order to have a greater presence on the domestic market within their community.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4158940">That is why they wholeheartedly welcome the NDP's proposal, which is well known. Three years ago, I worked alongside the member for <Affiliation DbId="170820" Type="2">Montmagny—L'Islet—Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup</Affiliation>, who was our tourism and SME critic at the time. We launched a campaign to raise awareness among small business owners and the business community in Quebec and Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="4158941">At the time, it was the member for Sudbury who was leading the campaign in the rest of the country. The campaign was very popular, both among chambers of commerce and such organizations as the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. That was three years ago already, but we still need to implement this measure. It was already overdue even before that campaign began, which is why we will continue to advocate for stricter regulations.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158942">The motion brought forward by the member for <Affiliation DbId="170545" Type="2">Marc-Aurèle-Fortin</Affiliation> is therefore most welcome. It reveals what direction the official opposition plans to take, once we form the new NDP government in October 2015, in order to help small businesses and merchants in Quebec and Canada deal with the various challenges they face by limiting credit card interchange fees.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Why? It is because in the House, there are two sides. One side is the side of Canada and of Canadians. It is the side of the spirit of Tommy Douglas, a great Canadian. This Canadian developed a policy to include economic development and social solidarity. At the same time, everybody had a job and the respect and help of the state. </ParaText><ParaText id="4158944">The other side is the side of great American losers. This un-Canadian government is motivated by the spirit of George W. Bush, a great loser. Those guys are on the other side. Presently, this un-Canadian government refuses to help small Canadian enterprises. Imagine: the result of the un-Canadian government policy is a 2% rate for credit cards in Canada for small enterprises, but in the European Union it is 0.3% and in Australia it is 0.5%, a fraction of the present rate.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158945">For this reason, it is a clear deception, but absolutely not a surprise. Each time this un-Canadian government has a chance to sabotage the Canadian economy, it does not lose the opportunity. It transformed Canada into a kingdom of corporate welfare dumps. That is it. That is all.</ParaText><ParaText id="4158946">It is our choice. We refuse to have such a Canada, and in the next election, Canadians will vote for a Canadian party.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
