Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="200981">Mr. Speaker, last night, I think quite inadvertently, a mistake was made during the deferred recorded division on the Liberal amendment to Bill <Document DbId="2334521" Type="3">C-24</Document>. </ParaText><ParaText id="200982">I am sure you will recall, Mr. Speaker, as you were in the chair at the time, that during the vote process the NDP rose to seek consent to have NDP members who were present for the previous vote recorded in support of the Liberal amendment to Bill <Document DbId="2334521" Type="3">C-24</Document>. Unfortunately, the reality is that when the NDP House leader rose for a second time to seek consent, that consent was denied by the House at that time.</ParaText><ParaText id="200983">As it was very evident to me, I rose on a point of order and stated that no points of order were to be entertained by the Chair during the vote process and, second, that I wanted to ensure the public viewing the vote process last night did not blame the clerks for the NDP members missing their opportunity to vote. Likewise, I believe that when a party, or an individual member for that matter, seeks to correct the record of a vote after the vote process is completed, it is normal tradition in the House that consent is granted by the members present in the House.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="200984">In conclusion, I believe that one mistake in the House should not be compounded by a second mistake. Therefore, in the interest of non-partisanship, common courtesy, traditional practice and in fairness to the New Democratic Party, in particular my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78825" Type="2">Acadie—Bathurst</Affiliation>, I seek the unanimous consent of the House at this time to have the results of the deferred division taken last night on the Liberal amendment to Bill <Document DbId="2334521" Type="3">C-24</Document> corrected to indicate that the NDP did intend to support the Liberal amendment.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Jay Hill</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="200986">Mr. Speaker, I respect the desire to have all the parties involved in this but, as I just explained, it is common practice and common courtesy for the House to grant unanimous consent. It has happened many times to members from all four parties present in the House. From time to time mistakes are made during votes. I have seen the situation where some members during private members' votes because of confusion vote both ways and have it corrected afterward.</ParaText><ParaText id="200987">Mr. Speaker, I would again ask you to put the motion. I see the official opposition House leader is here. Perhaps he would be willing to consult with his members very quickly and grant permission for them to support this motion to amend the vote results from last night.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="05">(1005)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Goodale" id="1695739"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78924" Type="2">Hon. Ralph Goodale (Wascana, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="200988">Mr. Speaker, the proposition that the whip for the government presents on the floor this morning comes as a bit of a surprise because of the government's position last night, which was exactly the opposite.</ParaText><ParaText id="200989">The proposition that he is bringing forward appears, from a substantive point of view, to be a reasonable one in view of the fact that there was either confusion or an error in the course of the taking of the vote on the amendment to Bill <Document DbId="2334521" Type="3">C-24</Document> that was entirely unintentional and inadvertent on the part of the New Democratic Party. I suspect there is a will in the House to see that it is corrected.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="200990">However, I need to point out, Mr. Speaker, that this is not the first time this has occurred. We saw a similar incident in the spring in relation to a vote on a budget bill; I hasten to add, not on the budget itself, but in relation to the vote on the budget bill. At that time the House, specifically on the part of the government and perhaps the Bloc, but I do not want to characterize its position because I do not know for sure, did not have the will to accommodate the simple correction of what was an obvious inadvertent occurrence that, since that time, I must say, the government has been at some pains to exacerbate.</ParaText><ParaText id="200991">The point is that these incidents do, unfortunately, occur. It is obvious to all members of the House that they are inadvertent and there has, at least up until last spring, been the will in the House to immediately recognize the reality of the situation and to cooperate with each other to correct the error and ensure the record accurately reflects what the will of the House would be.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="200992">In this instance I think it is obvious what the NDP intended, even though that was not reflected in the detail of what happened last evening. From the opposition's point of view, we are certainly prepared to see that inadvertent situation put right and the accurate reflection of the NDP's position to show through in the proceedings of the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="200993">I simply make the point that the same goodwill, the same give and take and the same sense of fair play and accurate reflection should apply in all circumstances.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The reality is that due to inattention--</ParaText><ParaText Interjection="e1" id="200995"><Affiliation DbId="78924" Type="2">Hon. Ralph Goodale: </Affiliation> It's exactly the same thing.</ParaText><ParaText id="200996"><Affiliation DbId="78995">Hon. Jay Hill: </Affiliation>It is not exactly the same, Mr. Speaker. In fact, it was quite different.</ParaText><ParaText id="200997">I have only been here 13 years but I remember when the Liberal Party was in power and quite often it would deny unanimous consent to correct errors that opposition parties made.

This report is essentially comprised of the motion adopted on October 4 by a majority of committee members, which reads:</ParaText><ParaText id="201006"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">That, pursuant to Standing Order 108(2), the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage recommend that the government continue funding the Court Challenges Program at the fiscal 2005-2006 level. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201007">It will come as no surprise to anyone that this recommendation or proposal was not adopted unanimously. It was adopted, however, by a majority of committee members. That is why, having given notice of this proposal, I hasten to put it forward this morning. I do believe that this is a matter of critical importance. So much so that I might suggest a possible connection with the government bill to amend the Criminal Code that was just introduced. This bill introduced by the government this morning could very well be challenged in court some day. It is highly likely that people will need financial assistance to assert their rights then. Initially, that is what the court challenges program was intended for.</ParaText><ParaText id="201008">Let us look at a bit of history. Hon. members might remember that, in the early 1980s, Canada established the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and patriated the Constitution, opening the way to a marvellous societal adventure. The subsequent decades saw the rights proclaimed at that time, rights enshrined in a charter which is the envy of many, be affirmed in our country. That is indeed what happened. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201009">It has often been said that, on paper, the Russian constitution was probably the best in the world. But we have to go further than that and see to what extent people's rights and freedoms are respected on a daily basis. In that respect, Canada is a leader. </ParaText><ParaText id="201010">For over two decades now, we have upheld those rights. The Court Challenges Program of Canada has been an important part of asserting our rights and liberties. Our success as a country is due in large part to this program, which has enabled traditionally underprivileged groups and the poor to assert their rights and exercise their citizenship fully. A former Conservative government abolished this program, and the Liberal government reinstated it in 1994. I find it very disturbing that, once again, the Conservative government is targeting the court challenges program and, at the end of September, announced its intention to eliminate it. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201011">I hope that a majority of the Canadian people's representatives in this House will choose to maintain this program because it is a social tool of vital importance. Many have said so. To those who indulge in exaggeration, who allege that this program encourages parties to challenge government actions in court, I would say that we must look to the facts. I know that the <I>Calgary Herald</I> published an editorial on July 16, 2006, stating that over 50,000 suits were brought against the government in court. That may be, but not all of these cases went through the Court Challenges Program of Canada.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="201012">As we know, charter law is a rather specialized area and most cases against the government would not even involve constitutional issues. The 50,000-plus cases the <I>Calgary Herald</I> editorial was referring to this past July are cases that individuals may bring against the government on whatever grounds, but in terms of charter cases, let us be clear.</ParaText><ParaText id="201013"> This information can be obtained from the annual report of the court challenges program. Between 1994, when the program was re-established after the Mulroney government cut it, and 2005, the program has funded 375 equality rights court cases and 142 language rights court cases. Of those, 121 of the 375 equality rights cases were to fund interveners, not the original plaintiffs, and 44 of the 142 language rights cases were also to fund interveners.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp><ParaText id="201014">That is the nature of what we are addressing. The cost of the program was slightly over $2 million, which of course we know is, in the grand scheme of things, a sum of money that the government and the country can afford. We will get to that in a few minutes.</ParaText><ParaText id="201015">So that people understand the nature of the program, I note that it does not even involve constitutional issues. It involves very specific issues of equality and language rights. It is restricted by contribution agreements between the non-profit organization that was created to manage the program and the Government of Canada. Therefore, it is all spelled out and directed as per the will of the government. </ParaText><ParaText id="201016">To say that it is a program that benefits only certain groups and certain people is not accurate. On that front, I would like to give an example. I can give this example because the people involved have given their permission to be quoted. Indeed, some of the cases are now before the court system.</ParaText><ParaText id="201017">There is a group from the linguistics side and also a number from the equality side.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="201018">On the official languages side, the Centre d'avancement et de leadership en développement économique communautaire de la Huronie believes that its rights to community economic development have not been respected. This case is before the courts.</ParaText><ParaText id="201019">In another case, Claudette Chubbs has challenged the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador in the court of appeal on the issue of the rights of parents of eligible children in the L'Anse-au-Clair, Forteau and L'Anse-au-Loup regions to have their children educated in French.</ParaText><ParaText id="201020">For its part, the Fédération Franco-TéNOise is taking a legal challenge to the court of appeal for clarification as to whether the Government of the Northwest Territories—and, by extension, all the territorial governments—is an institution of the Government of Canada for the purposes of section 20 of the charter.</ParaText><ParaText id="201021">The case of Raymond Robinson and Gerry Deneault is a legal challenge filed by parents of children who attend the Centre Jules-Léger in Ottawa, the only public primary or secondary school in Ontario that provides instruction in French for children with learning disabilities.</ParaText><ParaText id="201022">Despite court statements that have identified school management and control as important aspects of exercising the rights set out in section 23 of the charter, there are no mechanisms for consultation or cooperation between centre administrators and parents of eligible children. There are other similar cases and cases relating to equality.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="201023">On equality rights, we have a number of cases being funded by the court challenges program. I have to list a few so that Canadians have a sense of the scope and the importance of the court challenges program.</ParaText><ParaText id="201024">There is one case by the name of Amparo Torres Victoria v. Canada, in this case the <Affiliation DbId="78748" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship and Immigration</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="78755" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation>. It is the case of a lady who was a trade union and human rights and political activist in Colombia and is now accused of terrorism. She is defending herself against the charges. In doing so, she is challenging sections 33, 34, 78 and 86 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, essentially because she is being charged in secret. We have just had a very famous case dealt with in this country in that regard and we ought to be very careful about this. This kind of case would indeed probe the legality and the constitutionality of certain sections of that law.</ParaText><ParaText id="201025">There is the case of the Council of Canadians with Disabilities v. Via Rail Canada Inc. This application was on the agenda for the panel's November 2006 meeting but cannot be heard. The appeal concerns the purchase by Via Rail of passenger railcars that are inaccessible to persons in wheelchairs.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201026">We also have the case of the Canadian Association of Retired Persons v. Canada. The applicant is an organization representing elderly persons who wish to challenge paragraph 15(1)(c) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, a provision that allows for mandatory retirement. This is of rather significant importance.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="201027">There is also Le Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec v. CRTC.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="201028">In this case, the applicant is challenging section 5(1)(b) of the broadcasting regulations as violating section 15 of the charter based on under-inclusiveness. </ParaText><ParaText id="201029">The Metro Toronto Chinese and Southeast Asian Legal Clinic is involved in challenging provisions of federal immigration law that require sponsors to meet minimum levels of income or deny social assistance recipients' right to sponsor, something of significance to a number of Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="201030">I can go on. A number of cases are of great importance to the social fabric of our community. Some involve aboriginal Canadians, for instance the Fort Providence Metis Council, and some involve the Inter-Cultural Association of Greater Victoria. </ParaText><ParaText id="201031">This is a program rooted in our communities. I take great exception to the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister's</Affiliation> response when asked why his government did this to the court challenges program. He said two things, one of which was that he did not like funding “Liberal lawyers”. That is a great mis-characterization and is disingenuous at best, because this program funds our communities, our associations, our non-profit organizations and our individuals, rooted in Canada and their communities, who are fighting to make sure their rights are respected. They choose their lawyers. For the Prime Minister and some of his ministers to respond the way they did is not worthy of the offices they hold. I take great exception to that. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201032">However, the second response given by the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> in his reasoning why the court challenges program was cancelled is frightening. The Prime Minister said something to the effect that his government intends to behave in a constitutional manner. I hope so. All governments and all executives should be expected to behave in a constitutional manner. It goes without saying. For the Prime Minister to think that he has to say his government intends to behave in a constitutional manner is rather outlandish.</ParaText><ParaText id="201033">Then the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said in this House, “We do not intend to adopt unconstitutional legislation”. I have serious problems with that statement. First, not only does the court challenges program address proposed legislation, but it addresses existing legislation as well, legislation that has been on the books since the start of this country, legislation both here in the Parliament of Canada and in the provinces and territories. That is what is involved in the court challenges program. We have seen a number of cases in which we have had to reach back and where, because of laws passed before the advent of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, some sections of laws were struck down. That is the first difficulty I have with the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister's</Affiliation> response.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201034">Another difficulty I have is that his statement implied that it only applies here for legislation passed by this Parliament and sanctioned by the Queen. That is not so. Some of the rights protected in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms affect provincial legislation as well. Education is a case in point. A number of the linguistic rights cases that have been funded by the court challenges program fall under that category. For the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to say we do not need this because the government will only adopt constitutional laws is disingenuous again, because it applies to the entire universe of laws that this Parliament has put in existence plus what is out there in the provinces.</ParaText><ParaText id="201035">There is another point about the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> saying that his government does not intend to adopt unconstitutional legislation. Two provinces have said that some of the bills introduced by the government are unconstitutional. There is a slight problem here. The Government of Quebec and I believe the Government of Ontario have said that in terms of legislation dealing with the other place.</ParaText><ParaText id="201036">So which is it? Does the government not intend to adopt unconstitutional legislation? That brings me to the fourth and most important difficulty, a scary consequence of what the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201037">There are three branches of our government: the executive branch, which is the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and his cabinet; the legislative branch, which is us in this House; and there is the judiciary. By the Prime Minister saying that we, the executive, do not intend to adopt unconstitutional legislation, he is actually substituting the executive for both the legislative and the judiciary branches in this country. That is very scary. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp><ParaText id="201038">As a legislator I am very concerned that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> would have the attitude that he knows best, that his government, his executive, can decide what laws are to be adopted. First of all, that is the prerogative of the legislature. The Prime Minister should know that especially in a minority situation. Then, that the judiciary would not have a say, as a legislator I am concerned. As a citizen I am scared. </ParaText><ParaText id="201039">If that is the attitude that is coming from this government, then I understand why it cut, eliminated, and slashed the court challenges program. I think the will of this House should be listened to by this government. Where the country is going now is not very good.</ParaText><ParaText id="201040">In effect, we are starting to see here a bit of an advocacy chill. We are seeing a government that is trying to shut down systematically those who would speak in ways that do not please the government. The court challenges program is very much a case in point. It is not the only one. </ParaText><ParaText id="201041">We have seen what this government has decided in terms of funding for women's groups in this country. The government has actually taken advocacy off from what the groups could do in order to receive money. The groups can no longer advocate. If they do, they are not eligible for subsidies. If that is not an advocacy chill, I do not know what it is.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201042">The <Affiliation DbId="78749" Type="4">Minister of Agriculture</Affiliation> is getting into the game. He has put out a directive that the Wheat Board cannot use its resources to promote itself. If that is not an advocacy chill, what is it?</ParaText><ParaText id="201043">Canadians are starting to see a pattern here. This government is not even prepared to listen to another point of view. It is still a minority government. I guess that is the reason why polls are indicating that Canadians have no appetite to give this government a majority. Canadians are starting to be very concerned about the consequences of that.</ParaText><ParaText id="201044">If my colleagues think that I am the only one here, there are a number of people in our society that have made comments. I would like to take a few minutes and read a couple of quotes from people who have been following this issue. The national president of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, Paul Moist, said:</ParaText><ParaText id="201045"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">When we look at just 2 of these program cuts $5 million from the Status of Women and $5.6 million from the Court Challenges program, a clear message is being sent. The government is essentially saying that any voice given to addressing gender inequality in this country will be further silenced--furthermore any voices wanting to challenge the current status of the laws of this land will be muzzled.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201046"> Marcus Tabachnick, president of the Quebec English School Boards Association, had this to say in a letter sent to the <Affiliation DbId="79005" Type="96">Minister of Justice</Affiliation>:</ParaText><ParaText id="201047"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The pertinence of the Court Challenges Program of Canada has been recognized by the Canadian Bar Association.

The difficulty with the member's premise is that the court challenges program in effect deals with much more than that.

I will give him an example.</ParaText>

The francophone community went to court, had some support from the court challenges program, and the Supreme Court of Canada determined indeed that it was right and now it has a school. There were no laws in this case. It was a provincial inaction. The court challenges program has that broad a scope, it does not just deal with current legislation that is before us.</ParaText><ParaText id="201076">In terms of current legislation, I tend to agree.

However they believe in it when everything is going well, in times of prosperity when there is no need to rely on solidarity. </ParaText><ParaText id="201125">Who would have thought that a government could be so low, so irresponsible, so servile and petty—to use words that are parliamentary—as to abolish a program that calls for total spending of almost $3 million, because that is what it comes down to for the court challenges program?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201126">I have been here since 1993 and one of the stupidest things I have heard in my life as a parliamentarian came out of the mouth of the Prime Minister. I truly could not believe my ears when he justified himself in answering a question from the leader of the Bloc Québécois, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78493" Type="2">Laurier—Sainte-Marie</Affiliation>. The member asked why the government was abolishing the court challenges program, and what was the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s response? In all his wisdom and enlightenment, the Prime Minister said that the government had no intention of introducing unconstitutional legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="201127">Can you imagine the stupidity of such a statement, which is all the more worrisome coming from a head of state, a <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">prime minister</Affiliation>, a man who has major responsibilities when it comes to the value of equality?</ParaText><ParaText id="201128">Of course, governments never introduce unconstitutional legislation. When a submission is made to cabinet, the <Affiliation DbId="78758" Type="4">Minister of Justice</Affiliation> must ensure that the content of the bill is compatible with various human rights mechanisms. In the Canadian example there is the 1982 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and Diefenbaker's Canadian Bill of Rights, adopted in 1962, the year of my birth.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201129"> But that is not the substance of the debate. The substance of the debate is that certain rights are denied today. The law is in fact a changing thing. Our view of the law is subject to a certain evolution, for morals change. We no longer define indecency as it was defined in the 19th century. </ParaText><ParaText id="201130"> Take the death penalty for example. It was partially abolished in Canada in 1977, and definitively in 1982. Ultimately, it can be called cruel and unusual punishment in light of the Canadian Charter. </ParaText><ParaText id="201131"> So how can a head of state, in this instance the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, say that his government does not intend to table unconstitutional legislation? </ParaText><ParaText id="201132"> We will be returning to the Conservatives’ record on human rights. However, it is true that when a bill is tabled in this House, it has been evaluated by the Department of Justice.</ParaText><ParaText id="201133"> Nonetheless, that is not what we are talking about. The court challenges program is primarily a means of verifying the scope of rights. Moreover, the fact that a right is not recognized by the Supreme Court in 2006 does not mean it will not be recognized in 2012. I have some examples.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201134"> First, we know that the Conservatives are not fond of homosexuals, not fond of people of the homosexual orientation: they have exercised a policy of institutionalized homophobia. I am not saying that individually they are homophobes.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="05">(1105)</Timestamp><ParaText id="201135"> I am not saying that. I will give some examples. </ParaText><ParaText id="201136"> Since 1993, each time they have had the opportunity, the Conservatives, as a group, have voted against the rights of gays and lesbians. That is called institutionalized homophobia. I am not claiming that, as individuals, they are homophobes.</ParaText><ParaText id="201137"> Imagine if the Bloc Québécois had voted nine times against the rights of aboriginal people. Imagine if the Bloc Québécois had voted nine times against the rights of women. Imagine if the Bloc Québécois had voted nine times against the rights of the cultural communities. Well, on nine occasions all of the Conservatives, with about five exceptions, none of whom unfortunately are current members of this House, voted that way. Those are the facts.</ParaText><ParaText id="201138"> There was the first bill I tabled, on recognition of common-law spouses, which was supported by Mr. Lucien Bouchard and almost all of my caucus. This was in 1995. I remember that the vote on my bill was held on a Monday morning, and Alfonso Gagliano was the Liberal government whip. That was the only time in my life I voted on a Monday morning, and it was concerning my bill. Now, Sheila Copps was the only Liberal cabinet minister present at the time in this House. She represented the generous, humanist left wing of the Liberal Party. That Monday morning in 1995, however, other hon. members, 55 in all, supported that sole member of the Liberal cabinet present in the House.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201139"> So the Conservatives have voted against the rights of gay men and lesbians nine times. That is not insignificant.</ParaText><ParaText id="201140"> In 1995, when the motion I had introduced regarding same-sex common-law partners was voted on, Allan Rock amended the Criminal Code to add sexual orientation as a prohibited ground of discrimination in section 718.2.</ParaText><ParaText id="201141"> This was referred to as a provision relating to violent crimes motivated by hate. In imposing a sentence, the judge may look to a number of provisions under which he may find that there is an aggravating circumstance.</ParaText><ParaText id="201142"> In the second vote on Allan Rock’s bill, all of the Conservatives voted against it.</ParaText><ParaText id="201143"> The same was true when former minister Anne McLellan introduced a bill dealing with recognition of same-sex common-law partners. Obviously she introduced a bill because she was well aware that the federal government had little hope of winning the foreseeable court challenges. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201144"> The Conservatives introduced a motion saying that homosexual unions were not real families.</ParaText><ParaText id="201145"> They voted against Svend Robinson’s hate crimes bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="201146"> In committee, they voted against an amendment I proposed relating to access to new reproductive technologies by lesbians.</ParaText><ParaText id="201147"> Twice they voted against a motion relating to marriage introduced by the Conservatives, and against a bill relating to marriage introduced by the previous government. </ParaText><ParaText id="201148"> And so on nine occasions, the Conservatives, as a parliamentary caucus, have voted against the rights of gay men and lesbians.</ParaText><ParaText id="201149"> In 1995, a couple who had lived together for 40 years challenged the provisions of the law relating to the old age pension income supplement that is paid to people who have not reached the age of 60 or 65 years. They had been living together for 40 years, but one of them was not eligible because same-sex common-law couples were not recognized. At that point, the Supreme Court said that sexual orientation had to be added to section 15 of the Canadian Charter as a prohibited ground of discrimination.</ParaText><ParaText id="201150"> There is an example of a case which allows the Supreme Court, whose responsibility it is to bring about progress in the law, to take an updated look at our important legislation and the management of public funds used to assist minority groups in challenging laws. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="10">(1110)</Timestamp><ParaText id="201151"> I will say it again, when the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> rose in this House to say that his government did not intend to introduce unconstitutional legislation, that was one of the stupidest things I have heard in this House. Of course the government does not introduce unconstitutional legislation. It is the courts that bring about progress in the law, in some circumstances.</ParaText><ParaText id="201152"> I have cited the example of minority groups in terms of sex, but could we not say the same thing about minority groups in terms of language?</ParaText><ParaText id="201153"> Once again, what is it about the court challenges program that the government is afraid of?</ParaText><ParaText id="201154"> This is not the first time that this problem has arisen. Remember that this program was established in the 1970s. It is worth recalling that under Brian Mulroney, who was in fact more progressive than conservative, in their next to last year in power, the Conservatives wanted to abolish the court challenges program. In fact, they did not want to abolish it, they abolished it. It was only when the Liberals returned to power, in 1993, that the program was reinstated.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201155"> Obviously, there was great indignation over the elimination of the program. All the human rights activists made their opposition known. This is typical of the current government. It has no sympathy for the most vulnerable people. It is not sensitive to minorities. A government really needs to be low to slash literacy programs. It really needs to be low to attack the status of women. </ParaText><ParaText id="201156"> I would agree if a government were to say that a part of its responsibilities is to periodically evaluate how effective programs are in light of their objectives. We are not against program reviews and evaluations. But this government cut the court challenges program because it thinks that minorities do not need government assistance.</ParaText><ParaText id="201157"> Do they know how much it can cost to go to court? This is not a gratuitous criticism of lawyers; everyone has a right to earn a living. When a good lawyer wants to challenge some legislation and it goes all the way to the Supreme Court, he has to write statements of argument and must be very well prepared in order to back up his challenge. The legal fees for all this can reach hundreds of thousands of dollars. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201158"> Let me say parenthetically that two of my fellow citizens, Michael Hendrix and René Leboeuf, were the first to challenge the lack of equality when they were refused a civil marriage. They relied on the court challenges program because section 15 of the 1982 Canadian charter provides for equal treatment. What equal treatment means is not specified in the act. It is the courts that have defined what equal treatment is. </ParaText><ParaText id="201159"> Does anyone think that we would have made the great legal strides in minority rights without the court challenges? </ParaText><ParaText id="201160"> It is terrible to see what is happening now. It is terrible to see this lack of sensitivity on the government’s part. </ParaText><ParaText id="201161"> Maybe we need to look into whether the court challenges program is well managed. Maybe it should not be administered by a non-profit agency. We are open to this kind of discussion. But that is not what the government wants to hear. The government says that this program is not needed because it will not introduce any unconstitutional legislation. </ParaText><ParaText id="201162"> This government is extremely dangerous insofar as human rights are concerned. The Conservatives’ agenda is of deep concern to anyone who is a member of a minority, to anyone who believes deeply in equality, and to anyone who believes that minorities deserve to be helped to defend their rights. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="15">(1115)</Timestamp><ParaText id="201163">I cannot name one person in their cabinet or even their caucus who is an advocate for minority rights. I believe that two Conservative members may be somewhat more sensitive to the issue. I cannot name them, but the parliamentary secretary to the senator who has not yet been elected has some sensitivity.</ParaText><ParaText id="201164">The Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Treasury Board is moving ahead, but has not yet fully matured in similar files. He is giving me a sign, and we will see how he votes when his government introduces a motion to revisit the issue of civil marriage for same sex couples. The member is nodding his head and gesturing. I would like to assume that he is concerned about minority groups, but I am curious to know how he will vote when the time comes. If memory serves, he is not among the short list of Conservative members who supported the bill introduced by the former Liberal justice minister concerning marriage rights. </ParaText><ParaText id="201165">It is a rather sad state of affairs when we begin bargaining with minority rights and when we hear that $1.1 billion has been cut, even though there is a budget surplus of $15 billion. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201166">I saw the President of the Treasury Board on television, quite happy to be on camera to sign a $15 billion cheque. Meanwhile, our constituency offices had received the list of programs that were cut. Surprisingly, the programs cut were the programs that helped those less fortunate through literacy, housing and status of women.</ParaText><ParaText id="201167">Proof that this government in not interested in hearing public debate on human rights is that, in addition to cutting the court challenges program, it also abolished—yes, abolished—the Law Commission of Canada. True, the commission was known to question governments and to recognize, in its opinions, that the current state of rights may not be generous enough towards a certain minority group in our society. Nevertheless, a government that is proud of its minorities is one that gives them the tools they need to assert their rights.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201168">I will close by stating that it is possible to support the court challenges program without necessarily supporting institutional bilingualism in Quebec. I hope that the member for <Affiliation DbId="78455" Type="2">Ottawa—Vanier</Affiliation> will agree, although I doubt it. We all have an interest in helping the francophone community outside Quebec, for example, to become as dynamic as possible. In a minority language situation, one has to constantly fight for access to institutions. The governments did not just wake up one morning and decide to ask what they could do to improve the situation of minorities. It was the court challenges program that made it possible for linguistic minorities to gain access to educational institutions and to manage their own school boards. Just remember the fight that was waged on behalf of the Montfort, a French-language hospital. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201169">Finally I would like to say that this government will pay dearly for its insensitivity towards minorities, no matter which ones. The Bloc Québécois, and the other opposition parties, will never condone this lack of sensitivity towards minorities. On behalf of my Bloc Québécois colleagues and all the members of this house, I say shame on this government. One day its representatives will have to explain their gross neglect of minorities. We will never be a party to abolishing the court challenges program, a valuable program that defends human rights. And if this government has any sense of responsibility and honour, it will restore the budget of the court challenges program, which strongly supports human rights.</ParaText>

Although I say I am pleased to rise in this House, I think this is a sad day. The Conservative Party, the government, has decided to cut the court challenges program. By doing so, the minister has said, here in this House, that it was not right to give money to groups so that they can challenge a government that has created the laws. It is not right. If not, then the Supreme Court of Canada should be abolished.

Let us not forget that the ministers and members of this government cannot even talk to the press. Is that the kind of Canada we want?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201202"> I can give examples of the contribution that the court challenges program has made to minorities, and the support they have drawn from it. In New Brunswick, an attempt was made to move the food inspectors from Shippagan to Moncton, in the Dieppe and Shediac regions, and the Association francophone des municipalités du Nouveau-Brunswick, thanks to money from the court challenges program of Canada, brought a court challenge and won its case. This decision was then brought before the Supreme Court by the Liberal government of the time, which contested the decision of the Federal Court of New Brunswick. At least the municipalities had some tools at the time to defend the minority communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="201203"> Did they think that one person, an individual on his own, the Shippagan food inspector on his own, Mr. Gauvin and his colleagues, would have had the money to appeal to the Supreme Court? No.</ParaText><ParaText id="201204"> That is what the Conservative government wants. It wants to lay down laws, it does not want citizens to defend themselves; it is depriving citizens of the right to bring a court action against the government. It is setting itself up as a saint, it believes it is perfect, it thinks it is establishing good laws which citizens must respect. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201205"> If that were the case, the government should not have to be afraid of investing in court challenges, for it would win in court. However it is shameful to remove the democratic tool that allows citizens to defend themselves in Federal Court, in the Supreme Court of Canada and in the provincial courts. The Conservatives should be ashamed. I do not know how they can sleep at night.</ParaText><ParaText id="201206"> Let us consider the RCMP in New Brunswick, which was not providing service in both languages. Once again, New Brunswick organizations, through the SANB, received money from the court challenges program to go to court, and they won. At the time, the Liberals in power decided to contest this decision up to the Supreme Court. At least the organizations had the money to keep defending themselves.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201207"> If citizens and organizations cannot receive money through the court challenges program, to be fair the government should not have the right to take taxpayers’ money to fight citizens in court. That would be a bit more fair. Yet the government takes in money through taxes—whether citizens like it or not, taxes are deducted from their pay—and uses it to fight an individual in court. At the same time, it says it will not give the community the chance to benefit from this money in order to reach a happy medium, a balance of power.

The reason that women have made it to where they are today is because funding has been granted to create groups so that women are able to show what they can do and are recognized even here in Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="201210"> Equality between men and women must also be recognized. Equality was not achieved as a result of the wishes of a single person who stood up one fine day and said that he or she wanted equality between the sexes so that women would be respected and government would support this. There were battles fought and there are organizations that worked hard to achieve that objective.</ParaText>

So we are being told that when we get to be 40 years old we are no longer citizens, we are no longer human beings? What kind of attitude is that, Mr. Speaker? The attitude that the Conservatives are taking today toward these people and these organizations is disgraceful. They are going to realize that there are people working in these organizations and that those people talk to one another. At this moment, those people are protesting and a big wave will be hitting Ottawa, telling them that they are not right and they do not deserve to be leading this country. They have taken things away from us that are fundamental to our country.</ParaText><ParaText id="201212"> If you can imagine, two days before the literacy cuts the wife of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> of Canada took part in a march for literacy, all the while her husband, right here in the House of Commons, was cutting the funding for literacy training.

With all the cuts going on in industry today, we have to help the workers and equip them with the skills they need so that they can find new jobs. And yet the Conservatives are telling us that there will be budget cuts for the organizations that do this, cutting the fat, they say.</ParaText><ParaText id="201214"> So someone will have to go to the library in Bathurst by himself or herself to pick up a book. That person will go home and study independently, with no help from anyone, no teacher, no local organization. The same will be true in Timmins, Ontario, or in Regina, Saskatchewan, or in Edmonton, Alberta. People in Alberta love it when people from our hometowns work on their oil wells. What these cuts mean is that we will not give the people in our hometowns a hand so that they can learn to read and write. These are people who started working when they were very young and never had a chance to go to school. Are we going to let all these people fall by the wayside?</ParaText><ParaText id="201215"> You know, Mr. Speaker, I did not come to the House of Commons yesterday. How many times have we heard it said in committee that we have to do something for minorities? And then came the question of how much it is going to cost us.</ParaText>

Do not tell me that it is not true, because it is true.</ParaText><ParaText id="201217">Last year, I was forced to make a proposal to the effect that if the Standing Committee on Official Languages did not travel, none of the committees would travel. If we can send 12 people across the country to see where seals live, we can send the Standing Committee on Official Languages to anglophone and francophone communities to find out what people need.</ParaText><ParaText id="201218">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> had said that we should perhaps look at the system in Belgium, and he suggested that Quebec look after the francophones and the rest of Canada look after the anglophones. I was born in New Brunswick, on the Acadian Peninsula, and I am Canadian.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="40">(1140)</Timestamp><ParaText id="201219">I want to obtain services in both official languages, like any English- or French-speaking Canadian. Anglophones should be able to obtain service in their mother tongue where they live.</ParaText><ParaText id="201220">Someone has said that no one was asking all the anglophones to learn French and all the francophones to learn English. People were asking the government to offer service in both official languages. It is not hard.</ParaText><ParaText id="201221">It was sad when Senator Jean-Robert Gauthier had to introduce Bill <Document DbId="1426991" Type="4">S-3</Document> three times. The bill amended section 41 of part VII to make the obligations therein enforceable rather than declaratory. It applied to federal institutions, and the Bloc Québécois voted against the bill on the grounds that the government had no right to interfere in Quebec's areas of jurisdiction. However, at issue were areas of federal jurisdiction.</ParaText><ParaText id="201222">I am sorry, but we cannot rely on Quebec alone to defend francophones outside Quebec. Quebec showed in that instance that it had not defended them. This is a federal law that applies to federal institutions.</ParaText>

But even though I told them to vote against the bill they voted in favour. Now they think that, since they voted in favour of this bill, they can take away our right to appear in the various courts. That is what they did. They took our tools away from us.</ParaText><ParaText id="201224"> Take the example of the Montfort Hospital, here in Ottawa. It was not just because someone was sick and bedridden at the hospital that they won that case. It was because organizations got together to fight for it. They used money from the court challenges program. That is when the case was won, thanks to the support and desire to help.</ParaText><ParaText id="201225"> The government is a big machine and can become a dictatorship. It has the army on its side, the police on its side, it has everyone on its side in order to enforce the law. But in our democracy citizens get a chance to attend court. They are entitled to go to court and obtain judgment. Is the government right or not?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201226"> I will give some other examples. Take the example of electoral boundaries. In my riding this has caused some problems. They wanted to send some of the francophones from <Affiliation DbId="78825" Type="2">Acadie—Bathurst</Affiliation> to Miramichi, where 70% of the constituents are anglophone. Thanks to a court decision, that did not happen. In the history of Canada, that was the first time a boundary was changed by the court. The association of municipalities managed to do that with money from the court challenges program. Without that money, which boat would we have missed, what direction would we have taken?</ParaText><ParaText id="201227"> Here is another example. This morning at the Standing Committee on Official Languages we tried to pass a motion recommending that the government give back the money to the court challenges program. The only party that voted against this was the Conservative Party.</ParaText><ParaText id="201228"> This is unbelievable and unacceptable! Let us hope that it will change and that Canadians recognize it.</ParaText><ParaText id="201229"> We have a beautiful country. But we must not deceive ourselves—it is not just about francophones and anglophones; it is about power. That is the problem. It is dangerous to give too much power to a government. It is dangerous not to challenge its decisions, its interpretations or the directions it takes.</ParaText><ParaText id="201230"> To say that Liberal lawyers make a lot of money from that is wrong, completely wrong. How much work has Michel Doucet, a professor at the University of Moncton, done for us? How much responsibility has he taken on to defend francophones and minorities, without charging them anything?</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="11" Mn="45">(1145)</Timestamp><ParaText id="201231"> It was only for the court costs. How many hours of volunteer work did Michel Doucet of the Université de Moncton give freely? Thank you, Michel for what you have done on behalf of these communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="201232"> Today the Conservatives want to do away with that but we are not going to sit here in our seats without speaking out. We are going to fight for this. We will not accept that here in our country we cannot defend ourselves after laws have been passed, laws that are badly interpreted and not respected. </ParaText><ParaText id="201233"> They are not compelled to misinterpret legislation. If they do not respect it, if they do not do anything, the law and the courts give us the tools to force the government to do something. The fact of having services is just as significant for anglophone minorities in those places where francophones form a majority. It is not asking too much to be able to speak with your doctor in the language of your choice when you are sick. If you are having your appendix removed, it is to be hoped that the doctors will not remove your spleen. We must have access to these services. This morning at the Standing Committee on Official Languages we talked about the importance of ensuring that patients can receive services in the language of their choice in our hospitals. It is not too much to ask. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201234"> As I have said, we are not asking that all anglophones become francophones, nor that all francophones should become anglophones. We are asking that services be provided, that the Official Languages Act of our country be respected, and if it is not respected, we want the tools to go before the courts, before judges appointed by the government. We want to ask for the opinion of the court. That is democracy. What would it be without access to the courts?</ParaText><ParaText id="201235"> We are sending out soldiers to fight in Afghanistan to promote democracy, and in our own country we are abolishing it. It is a disgrace. In our own country we are cutting funding for the status of women but we are going into Afghanistan because we want Afghan women to have rights. We cut funding in Canada. Is that not hypocrisy?</ParaText><ParaText id="201236"> It is an insult, as the member for <Affiliation DbId="78495" Type="2">Québec</Affiliation> properly described it earlier. We went to Romania for the summit of la Francophonie. How could the Prime Minister stand up and say that he supports the Francophonie? At the same time he was cutting all the existing powers that enable minority communities in Canada to live the Francophonie. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201237">The wife of the Prime Minister of Canada took part in a walk in support of people with literacy problems. Two days later, her husband cut off funding for literacy. Where does that leave us? </ParaText><ParaText id="201238">The communities are hurting. We are getting phone calls about that. We are meeting people back home. Anyone who has not contacted Conservative MPs yet should know that there are toll-free numbers they can use. They can phone them; those numbers are at their disposal. If people are happy with all that is happening and want an American-style system, let them rejoice because it is on the way, well on the way. Once it is done, they will wonder why.</ParaText><ParaText id="201239">I know that the Conservatives will insist that they are not like that, that they invested money everywhere. The fact is that they are individualistic.Take what they did with child care. To keep the public quiet, they announced they would be providing a $1,200 benefit. But there is still no child care system. The American style is making its way into Canada. Whatever people say, this is a Bush-league style of work. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201240">If Canada were problem-free, there would be no need for the Francophonie and official languages department and its minister. Besides, that portfolio was not even given to a person who speaks both official languages. That is adding insult to injury. When the time came to appoint a parliamentary secretary, it took the government three months to appoint one. This shows how important official languages are to this government.</ParaText><ParaText id="201241">Nevertheless, this is our country, and we have to show one another respect; anglophones and francophones have to show each other respect. We are all human beings. We are just passing through on earth and we should be able to get along. There are countries where people speak five or six languages and they respect one another much more than we do here, in this country.

Let us look at the issue of whether or not the cases which are funded in part by the Canadian court challenges program touch on issues which are of interest to the majority of Canadians. </ParaText><ParaText id="201294"> Let us look at the case of R. v. Prosper in 1994. In this case, the Supreme Court of Canada considered whether an impoverished accused upon arrest had a right to state funded counsel. An intervener in the case argued that depriving poor people of access to counsel would result in inequality in access to justice that would be inconsistent with section 15 of the charter. The court held that where an arrested person requests counsel, the police must desist from attempting to obtain a statement until counsel has been provided. Justice McLachlin, who is now the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, in a concurring judgment noted:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201295"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">--the Charter right to counsel cannot be denied to some Canadian citizens merely because their financial situation prevents them from being able to afford private legal assistance.

The chief justice of the Supreme Court has said they are not constitutional castaways.</ParaText><ParaText id="201297">I would like to go to another case. This will be a case of great interest for those who know that there still exists bias within our society. Most Canadians abhor bias, bias in our legislation and bias in decisions by government officials who have, in many cases, a great deal of discretionary authority and power under various legislation. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201298"> R v. S, 1997 is an important case about judicial bias. At issue were remarks made by a black Nova Scotia judge in considering the credibility of both a police officer and R.D.S., an African-Canadian youth. The police had charged the youth with a number of criminal offences relating to an altercation between the police officer and the boy. The youth and the police officer each gave a very different account of the events leading up to the charges. </ParaText><ParaText id="201299">Judge Sparks weighed the evidence of the two witnesses. She then determined that the youth should be acquitted as the evidence raised “a reasonable doubt as to the youth's guilt”. In her oral reasons, Judge Sparks observed that in some situations, “Police officers do overreact, particularly when they are dealing with non-white groups”. The Crown challenged her remarks as raising a reasonable apprehension of bias. In the view of the Crown, a reasonable person would think she had prejudged the case without giving proper consideration to all of the evidence.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="15">(1215)</Timestamp><ParaText id="201300">There was a court challenge on that. The Supreme Court of Canada decided that Judge Sparks had not acted in a biased manner. Moreover, Justices L'Heureux-Dubé and McLachlin, and I remind members of the House and the new minority Conservative government that Beverley McLachlin is now the chief justice, determined that by paying attention to the racial dynamic in the case, Judge Sparks was simply engaging in the process of contextualized judging. As they stated, “It is perfectly acceptable for judges to take into account not only the facts of the case but also the social and psychological context within which the case arises”. They recognize that judges are members of communities, have particular knowledge of such communities and are often guided by this knowledge. Consequently, as a person familiar with the racial dynamic of Halifax, particularly where police are concerned, it was reasonable for Judge Sparks to apply this knowledge. </ParaText><ParaText id="201301">I conclude in showing--</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It is important for the laws of this land to be constitutional and that governments treat Canadians with the rights they have guaranteed under our Constitution and in our Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</ParaText><ParaText id="201327">Sometimes, whether it is intentional or not, those rights are trampled on and Canadians, whether they are wealthy or average, need a vehicle available to them to go before a court, obtain an explanation of the rights they are allowed, if there has been an infringement, and have an announcement by the court at the end of hearing facts.</ParaText><ParaText id="201328">We do not have infallible governments. I do not care that this is characterized in a partisan way. It is not a partisan issue.

HOWEVER, RIGHTS IN LAW BOOKS DO NOT AUTOMATICALLY LEAD TO RIGHTS IN REALITY.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201331"> I think that is understood. Individuals or groups can find themselves in situations where governments refuse to respect their constitutional rights and in those situations people may have to take their governments to court. Courts have the power to force the government to bring its laws, its practices and its policies into accord with our charter, but we know that court action is expensive. It is often far more costly for those very individuals or groups whose rights are not being respected or they themselves belong to marginalized groups.</ParaText><ParaText id="201332">The role of the court challenges program is to provide the financial support to people who want to use the courts to have those rights respected but lack the funds to do so on their own and, more specifically, it provides financial support to test cases that help to protect and advance the language and equality rights guaranteed under the Canadian Constitution. Aside from funding these cases, the program also funds activities that increase the awareness of the constitutional equality and language rights which fall under the program's mandate.</ParaText><ParaText id="201333">There are applications. Not just anybody gets it. There is a process of screening. There are funding criteria for the program. Federal laws, policies or practices could be challenged. It has to ensure that it is a test case and not already one that has been decided.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201334">Some examples of equality cases that have been funded were, first, the first nations people when they opposed a section of the Indian Act that prohibited them from voting in band council elections if they lived off reserve; second, same sex couples seeking the same rights to certain benefits and deductions under the Income Tax Act that are accorded opposite sex couples; third, parents of children with disabilities who sought employment insurance for periods when they must be off work to provide care for their children; and fourth, the legality of the current laws that restrict the courts from admitting evidence of prior sexual activity on the part of sexual assault complainants.</ParaText><ParaText id="201335">What can the program not fund? It does not fund any case that covers an issue already funded by the program or that is already before the courts. It does not cover challenges to actions taken by provincial governments, complaints under the Canadian Human Rights Act, challenges to provincial laws, policies or practices and public education, community development lobbying or political advocacy. </ParaText><ParaText id="201336">We should be very concerned when a government thinks it is appropriate to cut funding.

If something is challenged down the road and a few people's rights are trampled on in the meantime, that seems to be good enough for the government.</ParaText><ParaText id="201338"> It is not good enough on this side of the House. Somebody has to take responsibility for protecting people's constitutional rights and protecting their rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It is true that we are getting a large number of pieces of legislation coming forward, but does that equal a deliverable law and order agenda, for instance? Or does one put questionable pieces of legislation before this House and then take away the very funding that some of the marginalized people under those pieces of legislation perhaps would have access to with the court challenges program, in order to question their government when they feel the government has gone over the line?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201339">These are not new thoughts. This is a program that was established in 1978 to provide access to justice in relation to minority rights. In 1982 Canada received the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and it came into force. In 1985 the program included funding for equality rights cases under section 15 of the charter. We know that in large part the historically disadvantaged groups in our society have been the ones to utilize this program. They are not the only players in the system, but in large part we have those people who are being challenged in many other ways being able to bring their cases for a proper determination before the courts.</ParaText><ParaText id="201340">I will quote the parliamentary Standing Committee on Human Rights and the Status of Disabled Persons, which said, “This program has made a critical difference in bringing constitutional rights within the reach of francophone parents, aboriginal women and persons with disabilities”.</ParaText><ParaText id="201341">The court challenges program guide tells us that the program is happy to support “test cases that help to protect and advance the language and equality rights guaranteed under the Canadian Constitution”. </ParaText>

We know that we had a $13 billion surplus and we know that this is a question of priorities. There are many, many good programs seeking funding from this House. There are very, very few programs that help those who are less advantaged in our society have access to the courts to make sure their voices and those whom they represent can have a say in obtaining rights that are theirs.</ParaText><ParaText id="201376"> We did not say, when we gave this country its Charter of Rights and Freedoms, that only wealthy people who could afford lawyers would be able to have access to their rights.

Most of us in this House know that legislation has to meet constitutional tests.</ParaText><ParaText id="201377"> I personally do not understand why this program would have been targeted. I do not want to impugn motives to people on the other side. But the reality is that they have cancelled an important program. The reality is that we have equality issues in this country. The reality is that minority language rights have to be upheld throughout the country. And the reality today is that the Conservative government has limited access to the courts through the cancellation of the funding for this program.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201378">These are facts, indisputable facts. Why has the government done this? Because it got great advice from Canadians saying they hate the program? No, that is not the reason. This is ideological. The government is either saying it is perfect and has it right all the time, or it is saying to heck with constitutional rights. If somebody wants to spend their own money, not government money, not taxpayers' money, not in our value system as a nation together, then they can do it on their own time and their own penny. What does that say about the thinking of the current government? What does that say about how it values the access and equity issues among the most disadvantaged Canadians?</ParaText><ParaText id="201379">I note your signal, Mr. Speaker. I have other letters here. My colleagues and I have lists of organizations that have contacted us. I must put on the record that I have not had one phone call or received one piece of correspondence saying, “Hurrah for the government. It cancelled the program”. Not one. I have not seen that.</ParaText><ParaText id="201380"> I think that is important. It is not only this area that has been cut off. I see a pattern developing. I see my friends on the other side getting ready to pounce, so I will put it on the record now. I see a pattern developing in which the government is telling Canadians it is protecting law and order in this country just because it is piling up legislation. But as members will know, people are working in this House every day on legislation. Members of the justice committee whom I work with every day are working through legislation. In fact, we just added another weekly meeting to our agenda to be able to work through legislation, and we will make sure that it is constitutional.</ParaText>

The most important issue we should address is the fact that funding has been cut, funding that gave marginalized individuals and groups that had real issues to bring before the courts cases involving their language rights and often education rights. </ParaText><ParaText id="201400">A lot of these cases have been in my area. Susan Abbey v. Essex County Board of Education was a language rights case. The judicial rights case, R. v. Beaulac in 1999 was groundbreaking case in the development of judicial rights.

							<ParaText id="201409">The federal government would have us believe that it is eliminating the court challenge program because it is somehow frivolously funding every Tom, Dick and Harry to sue their own government over legislation that it puts in place. Essentially this is the answer we heard in question period when the <Affiliation DbId="78780" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> was pressed on this issue. We were pressing the minister for the business case. We were pressing him for some reason, some rationale as to why this heavy-handed move was justified. This is a deliberately simplistic and misleading overview of what the court challenge program does. </ParaText><ParaText id="201410">The one thing that the member for <Affiliation DbId="78658" Type="2">London West</Affiliation> has done for us is spell out, not just what the federal court challenge program does, but the things that it does not do. It certainly does not provide funding to anyone who wants to sue the federal government. There are very rigid tests. The bar is set very high as to what type of challenges qualify for any support under the court challenges program.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201411"> It is a matter when legislation, by omission or commission, offends the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, or the Constitution of Canada, or it somehow is applied in such a way that a legitimate group of Canadians feel that they are not being treated equally by their own Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The highest duty of a member of Parliament is to ensure that all Canadians are treated equally.</ParaText><ParaText id="201412">I am proud to say that this is one country in the world where equality is our main objective, which is not the case everywhere in the world. In Canada we have very meticulously written in to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms the assurance that Canadians can count on being treated equally as far as the application of services, benefits or anything provided by the government. Therefore, it is not a nuisance to the government to have Canadians or organizations test the Charter of Rights and Freedoms by these regular court challenges. It strengthens our rights. Our rights are made more secure by these challenges.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201413">We should keep in mind that the Canadian Constitution is not a rigid document. It is a living, breathing, evolving document that can benefit from these rare and infrequent tests and challenges.</ParaText><ParaText id="201414"> We should at least start from the same base level of information as we ask Canadians to concern themselves with this debate. They should go into this with their eyes open. Clearly the government has tried to sneak this through in a flurry of other activity and other cutbacks, hoping no one will notice this relatively small budget line. Let us be fair. This is a very small amount of money on the global scale of things. Let us also ensure that misinformation is not what is guiding us here. We have to challenge comments from the <Affiliation DbId="78780" Type="4">President of the Treasury Board</Affiliation> when he says that all the money just goes to Liberal lawyers anyway.</ParaText><ParaText id="201415">My colleague from Windsor pointed out that these challenges are often collaborative efforts by non-profit groups and NGOs. They find lawyers to work pro bono. The court challenge money they get, or the enabling money, is often used to pay for court costs, expert witnesses, research, et cetera.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp><ParaText id="201416">Having laid that foundation, I challenge the veracity of both of the excuses given by the President of the Treasury Board. I think we could then begin to have a proper debate about whether or not we need this assistance in our judicial system. </ParaText><ParaText id="201417">Let me point to one case to illustrate how valuable this program can be. It is my own personal experience. In Winnipeg Centre the Community Unemployed Help Centre deals with people who are having trouble with their employment insurance. On behalf of one client, Kelly Leisuk, the centre launched a Federal Court challenge sponsored by the court challenge program . The centre maintained that the EI act does not treat women equally, that women suffer a gender imbalance with the application of EI as it was evolved by the Liberal government.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201418">When the EI system went from a weekly based system to an hourly based system, women were disproportionately and negatively impacted in that more women worked low wage part time jobs and so women qualified less often for any EI benefits than men did. The empirical evidence was fairly straightforward. Frequent appeals to the federal government bore no satisfaction at all. We made the case to the federal government that the EI program was affecting women negatively, but the government of the day was deaf to this gender imbalance. The only avenue of recourse was to make a charter challenge under section 15, the equality provisions of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, that the EI act as contemplated by the Liberal government offended the charter.</ParaText><ParaText id="201419">Where else would a non-profit workers' organization go? Its total budget, and I know because I sat on its board of directors, is $250,000 a year. That funded four staff to advocate on behalf of people having trouble with their employment insurance. Where would an organization like that go to launch a massive Supreme Court challenge if not to the court challenge program?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201420">When viewed in that light, it is an issue of natural justice, in this case on behalf of Canadian women. They would not have a voice and would not be able to have legal representation in this compelling matter were it not for the court challenges program. It is not unlike legal aid. We do not allow defendants to go into a courtroom unrepresented. They are given legal aid. No one argues if that is fair. It is a natural justice issue. In that same context, from time to time we need to test the veracity of our Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and thereby strengthen it by these court challenges by legitimate groups within Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="201421">I condemn the government for cutting the court challenges program.

Never before has a government fought a trade dispute in the courts, won every single case, and then turned around and dismissed these victories. Never before has a government thrown the rule of law completely out the window. </ParaText><ParaText id="201484">Never before has a government given up our leverage in our negotiations before making an agreement. Never before has a minister caved in to meet an artificial timeline that was of his own making. Never before has a minister bullied our own industries to please the United States. Never before has Canada witnessed a government that has gone to bat for political expediency instead of going to bat for hard-working Canadians. </ParaText><ParaText id="201485">Simply put, this softwood lumber deal is not a deal at all. It is a complete sell out.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201486">Last Friday, the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that Canadians are entitled to the return of every single penny of our $5.3 billion that was illegally imposed by the United States and that we have free entry of our product into its markets. We finally have the United States in its own courts, so why is the government wiping away five years of legal victory? Why are we foregoing $1 billion of the total duty owed and agreeing to a new border charge that can be as high as 22.5%?</ParaText><ParaText id="201487">This deal reeks either of complete incompetence or of complete inexperience, and I fear it reeks of both. The agreement that the minority Conservative government has rammed down Canadians' throats makes a mockery of free trade and turns over our domestic sovereignty to the United States of America. It also creates a sliding scale export tax that at current price levels is actually higher than the current U.S. duties, 22.5% versus the 8.5% that we were previously paying versus the 0% that we would have been paying after last Friday.</ParaText><ParaText id="201488">This agreement also abandons all our legal victories and gives up, as I said, $1 billion to secure the peace. How long are we securing the peace for? For as much or as only two years.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201489">This agreement also seeds our decisions over domestic resource management to the United States. Now Washington will be calling the shots in our very own forests. It caps the share of the American softwood market at 30% when in fact the previous Liberal government turned down a cap of 34%. This deal is actually worse than the deal we previously declined.</ParaText><ParaText id="201490">This agreement also contains anti-surge provisions that cripple the ability of our forest industry to deal with unexpected circumstances such as the rise of the pine beetle infestation in British Columbia. It exposes firms to needless uncertainty by agreeing to a monthly measurement for surge protection when U.S. demand is highly variable on a monthly basis.</ParaText><ParaText id="201491">The agreement encourages other sectors to seek political decisions to get protection from Canadian industries, all but guaranteeing more disputes in the future.</ParaText><ParaText id="201492">It gets worse. Not only are we giving up more than $1 billion, but we are returning over half this money, $500 million, to the very U.S. lumber industry that we are engaged with, money that it will use down the road to attack Canadian industry.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201493">Even American lawyers think the floor crossing minister was suckered in this deal. The inexperienced, incompetent Conservative government took the terms of the surrender and now Canadians will have to pay the price. They will have to pay the price in lost jobs, lost hope, and devastated world communities. </ParaText><ParaText id="201494">This deal was botched by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78539" Type="2">Vancouver Kingsway</Affiliation> and, sadly, it was botched badly. Now our forestry industry, our forestry workers, and our Canadian communities will have to pay the price.</ParaText><ParaText id="201495">Over 360,000 Canadians are employed in the softwood industry. We have a well-earned international reputation for the quality of our wood and our products. It is not an easy time. They are also facing pressure from a high Canadian dollar, high energy prices, lower housing starts in the United States, and a shrinking demand for global newsprint. </ParaText><ParaText id="201496">This deal, I am afraid, will only worsen their plight, and has in fact already directly caused the layoff of thousands of workers in just the past 30 days.</ParaText>

The Independent Lumber Remanufacturers Association warns that this deal would all but destroy this sector.</ParaText><ParaText id="201498">To add insult to injury, the minority Conservative government has continued to bully our industries into submission.

The last time I was supposed to speak at second reading but, because of the amendment by the Liberals who wanted to draw out the debate, I had to speak about the amendment. I will now speak directly to the bill at second reading.</ParaText><ParaText id="201523">Just now I heard something completely absurd from the Conservative member. It is extraordinary that such imagination is used to hide a government that is incompetent in the extreme. She said—and I am not quoting her directly as you can look in the <I>House of Commons Debates</I>—that had the members of Parliament accepted an agreement earlier, such as the one negotiated by the Conservatives, there would not be as many unemployed individuals.</ParaText><ParaText id="201524">In this House, there is no difference between the Liberal and the Conservative Parties. As I just recently became the Bloc Québécois critic for international trade, I decided to do a bit of research. In 2001, almost one year before the agreement expired, the Bloc Québécois proposed several measures to help the forestry industry.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201525"> The legal proceedings launched by Canada and by the industry had not yet begun when we proposed measures such as loan guarantees for the companies. At that point, there were not only the countervailing duties that were being paid; there were anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties. The industry had a need for that kind of support. </ParaText><ParaText id="201526"> All the while, the Bloc Québécois strongly recommended and called for loan guarantees to save the forest industry. Those loan guarantees were refused by the Liberals. One of the Liberal ministers became a Conservative and again the loan guarantees were refused. Such loans would have enabled the industry to survive the crisis while the suits to defend those rights, rights upheld by many tribunals, were pending before the courts. </ParaText><ParaText id="201527"> Now, they tell us that they have an agreement. Normally in any economic transaction, in any agreement between two parties, if one party is adversely affected it is not the other party who gains. One does not give 20% of one's assets to the party that has treated one unfairly for years. Who was the winner in this affair? Who won a billion dollars? It was the United States.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201528"> How are we to understand that one party, on the strength of a number of decisions by various tribunals, having to wait perhaps only a few months more until the decisions are implemented, should agree to leave a billion dollars in the hands of our neighbour, who for all practical purposes had been exploiting us for several years? How can you explain such an attitude, unless it was to buy a special friendship with the Bush government? </ParaText><ParaText id="201529"> As a result, the Prime Minister, his acolytes, his members and ministers, got together and prepared an agreement that means the forest industry will continue to depend, probably for many years, on the whims of the Americans.</ParaText><ParaText id="201530"> In fact, we know that the Americans can call an end to this agreement whenever they feel like it, even if it is supposed to be guaranteed for seven years. I heard the Liberal member say earlier that, in fact, if the government had done its work properly, if it had guaranteed loans and provided support to the industry and to workers in the forest industry, we could have waited and in the end we would have won at the international court, NAFTA and the rest. It was recognized everywhere that there was no dumping and no subsidies.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp><ParaText id="201531"> Now, with the agreement, we are certain that 15% duty will have to be paid and volume will be limited as well. That fact will create two classes within the forestry industry. </ParaText><ParaText id="201532"> Quebec has agreed to option B. There is sometimes also a degree of latitude in the makeup of binational committees. I hope that Quebec will have its representatives on the binational committee. We will work for this to happen because Quebec is where the most business is done in lumber and forestry under option B.</ParaText><ParaText id="201533"> Obviously, Quebec is going to have to defend its interests directly, given that it is the leading partner agreeing to option B. When I began to speak, I referred to the Conservative Party member. The Conservative Party today seems to be laying the blame for all the problems in the forestry industry at the doorstep of environmentalists, and directly targeting Richard Desjardins. But it is the Liberals and Conservatives who are responsible for the decline of the forestry industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="201534"> If the Liberals had had the good fortune to be still in power after the last election, how far would they have gone in an agreement with the United States?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201535"> So it is obvious that we in Quebec were virtually unanimous in not wanting this agreement. The constraints manufactured out of thin air by both the Liberal and Conservative governments, one after the other, have strangled not only the industry but forestry workers as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="201536"> Yesterday there was a vote, and one of the measures proposed by the Bloc Québécois was adopted by this House, a measure relating to a support program for older workers.</ParaText><ParaText id="201537"> Today we learn that the program will probably be selective and will give preference to softwood lumber workers, the forestry industry and the textile industry. Are these rumours? There is always a kernel of truth in rumours. This program gains something for the forestry industry and the textile industry. But a worker who is 50 or 55 years old is still unemployed, regardless of what industry the worker comes from.</ParaText><ParaText id="201538"> As the leader of my party recently asked, how can we completely forget about someone who has worked in a particular field for 30 or 35 years, whether it be forestry or the textile industry? We are dismissing these people with a wave of the hand. As well, eligibility for the program will be based on region. This means that we will be creating several classes of older people who are unfortunately facing unemployment and who are unable to find new jobs.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201539"> Overall, no matter whether the government was Liberal or Conservative, we can see that both, one after the other, have completely dropped the ball when it comes to the forestry industry. As we have already said, we will be making a point of supporting this bill, because the survival of the forestry industry and of those workers, and, I hope, the revival of that industry, depend on it.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Fortunately Bush does not want and cannot have another term of office, because this would help him get elected. The billion dollars has mainly been used to develop specific friendships with the Bush government.

Our lumber communities during this long period of dispute have faced mill closures because of the tariffs and a long, drawn out and never-ending litigation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201562">The bill would bring prosperity back to the industry and back to our rural communities where the lumber industry is the mainstay. The bill would eliminate the punitive U.S. duties and would end the costly litigation that has gone on for far too long. Under this agreement, the U.S. will immediately dismiss all trade actions against our companies. It takes our lumber producers out of the courts and puts them back where they belong: in communities across this country, expanding their businesses and contributing to Canada's economy. It will provide stability for an industry hit hard by years of trade action.</ParaText><ParaText id="201563">For the next seven to nine years no border measures will be imposed when lumber prices are above $355 per thousand board feet. When prices drop below this threshold, the agreement gives provinces flexibility to choose the border measures most beneficial to their economic situation.</ParaText><ParaText id="201564">I should add that all export charged revenues collected by the Government of Canada through these border measures will stay in Canada. The softwood lumber agreement returns nearly $5 billion, a significant infusion of capital for the lumber industry, and will bring stability to the workers and communities that rely on it.</ParaText><ParaText id="201565">We have even developed a creative deposit mechanism to ensure that lumber companies receive their money as quickly as possible. Upon filling out and returning the necessary legal and administrative documents, companies will receive their funding within four to eight weeks.</ParaText>

I appreciate the opportunity to respond to the concerns raised by the <Affiliation DbId="78959" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration</Affiliation> in the House on Friday October 6 regarding the admissibility of an amendment to Bill <Document DbId="2195400" Type="3">C-14</Document> that was passed when the bill was under consideration in the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration. </ParaText><ParaText id="201865">As the mover of that amendment at the standing committee, I appreciate the opportunity to respond to the point of order. As we know, the amendment in question adds a new subsection to clause 2 of Bill <Document DbId="2195400" Type="3">C-14</Document>, which reads:</ParaText><ParaText id="201866"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Any decision of the Minister under this section may be appealed to the Immigration Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201867">I would first point out that this amendment was found by the chair of the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration to be in order, and it was discussed and debated by the committee and approved by a majority of members of the committee in that context.</ParaText><ParaText id="201868"> I would like to emphasize that the parliamentary secretary made his arguments before the committee at that time.</ParaText><ParaText id="201869"> As well, there was a vote at the committee, after hearing the arguments made by the parliamentary secretary and after hearing from other members, upholding the chair's ruling that the amendment was in order. The committee voted to sustain the chair's ruling.</ParaText><ParaText id="201870">I appreciate that the committee's actions do not preclude an approach to the Speaker and the House on this issue, but I want it to be clear for the Speaker that these issues were considered by the committee. I know that the Speaker has repeatedly found that in most cases committees know best when dealing with the matters before them, so I thought the fact that this amendment was debated and found in order by the committee is important.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201871">I submit that the amendment does not go beyond the scope of the bill as passed by the House at second reading. Bill <Document DbId="2195400" Type="3">C-14</Document> and the amendment in question are amendments to section 5 of the Citizenship Act. Section 5 deals with the question of grants of citizenship and sets out the minister's obligation with regard to the granting of citizenship. It also grants discretionary powers to the minister to waive requirements of the act in certain cases. </ParaText><ParaText id="201872">Bill <Document DbId="2195400" Type="3">C-14</Document> amends this section of the act by adding a new section 5.1 that addresses the citizenship of children adopted by Canadians overseas, granting them citizenship upon application at the time of the finalization of adoption. This removes the discriminatory effects of the current law, which requires adopted children to apply for permanent resident status and then meet the residency requirements before subsequently applying for Canadian citizenship, but grants children born to Canadians overseas immediate Canadian citizenship without such an application.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201873">Section 5 currently establishes criteria for obtaining Canadian citizenship, as well as noting situations where the minister may exercise discretion. Bill <Document DbId="2195400" Type="3">C-14</Document> proposes a new section 5.1, which adds new criteria when dealing with children adopted overseas by Canadians. The amendment proposed by the standing committee to Bill <Document DbId="2195400" Type="3">C-14</Document>, rather than stepping outside the scope of the bill passed at second reading, merely adds a further consideration to the decision making powers of the minister as outlined in sections 5 and 5.1 by allowing an appeal of the minister's decision. I submit that this is in keeping with the principle of the bill as passed at second reading.</ParaText><ParaText id="201874">With regard to the parliamentary secretary's contention that this amendment provides new powers and a new mandate to the Immigration and Refugee Board beyond what is provided in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, I would submit that denial of citizenship to an adopted child is a de facto denial of an immigration visa and permanent resident status to that child and, as such, the Immigration and Refugee Board is exactly the body that exercises judgment and rules on such cases. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201875">The board is the body that understands the issues related to the validity of adoptions of children by Canadians overseas by currently ruling on appeals of the denial of permanent resident status to children adopted overseas. I would maintain that the issues investigated and criteria applied currently to rule on an appeal of permanent resident status to a child adopted by a Canadian overseas will be the same issues and criteria used to rule on an appeal of the denial of citizenship to such a child should Bill <Document DbId="2195400" Type="3">C-14</Document> and the amendment be passed into law by Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="201876">This does not, therefore, add new powers or a new mandate to the Immigration and Refugee Board beyond those already mandated and exercised. The final result of decisions appealed will change as a result of a decision, given that under Bill <Document DbId="2195400" Type="3">C-14</Document>, should this amendment carry, an adopted child will become a Canadian citizen instead of a permanent resident, but the decision making process of the appeal is essentially the same.</ParaText><ParaText id="201877">In this respect, no new powers or mandate are conferred by the amendment, and no royal recommendation would be necessary since no new activities are being contemplated or undertaken. No new public funds should be required in these circumstances and therefore I would argue that it does not impinge on the financial initiative of the Crown. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201878">Mr. Speaker, this amendment was presented and its procedural admissibility was approved by the committee. In your ruling on the form and content of report stage amendments, made on March 21, 2001, you implored members to use every possible opportunity at committee to make amendments and therefore save report stage for the purpose it was intended.</ParaText>

							</ParaText><ParaText id="201881">This is exactly what I have been trying to do.

That would fly against all past practices of this place.</ParaText><ParaText id="201883">Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for hearing my response to the point of order raised by the <Affiliation DbId="78959" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration</Affiliation>.

The government cannot be the same party that just one short year ago sat on this side of the House decrying the notion of settling for anything less than a complete and outright vindication for Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="201893">I wish to quote for members from page 19 of the Conservative platform:</ParaText><ParaText id="201894"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">A Conservative government will:</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="201895"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">--Demand that the U.S. government play by the rules on softwood lumber. The U.S. must abide by the NAFTA ruling on softwood lumber, repeal the Byrd Amendment, and return the more than $5 billion in illegal softwood lumber tariffs to Canadian producers.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="201896">That is some pretty tough talk, which I think most in the House and most Canadians across this country could get behind. As a matter of fact, my party and I campaigned on roughly the same position, stating that:</ParaText><ParaText id="201897"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The recent string of NAFTA decisions in Canada's favour continue[s] to be valid and must be respected--the United States remains legally obligated to revoke the tariffs and refund, with interest, all duties collected, totalling more than $5 billion. A Liberal government will continue to wage a vigorous legal and political fight with the United States government and industry and will continue to consult with the provinces and Canadian industry on the best way to achieve a final and lasting solution.</QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201898">So here we are in the House to debate legislation which breaks the government's election promise, legislation which settles for a loss instead of a win, and legislation which brings in a politically expedient quick fix at the cost of the future of an industry and a way of life in Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="201899">Need I remind the government that Canada's legal position prior to the introduction of the Conservative government was supported by numerous decisions by international trade tribunals and by the courts in both Canada and the United States, and yet the government has settled for less, and a great deal less.</ParaText><ParaText id="201900">Further, I think this complete surrender to the United States government on this file only sets up this government--and more importantly, future governments--for hardship and failure on any number of issues in the future. I guess Washington knows that in future disputes with Canada the new government may not have the will or the stomach to stand up for Canada and fight when it is right to fight.</ParaText><ParaText id="201901"> This outright abandonment of Canada's position that our softwood industry is not subsidized shreds any notion that the dispute resolution provisions of NAFTA can work. It will only reinforce the will of certain U.S. legislators and bureaucrats that they can flaunt international rules any time they want and anywhere they want on any trade agreement.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201902">This deal is a bad deal for Canada. The criticisms have been articulated here in the House and across this country. It leaves $1 billion belonging to Canadian companies in the hands of Americans, $500 million of which is at the disposal of the U.S. lumber industry to use to fund legal attacks against us, against Canadians. They will use money from the Canadian softwood industry to attack that very industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="201903">This deal creates an export tax that at current price levels is actually higher than current duties and will create an unfair and unprecedented tax regime which will impose crippling export duties on softwood. It limits the government's ability to help the softwood industry, and it undercuts our rules-based trading relationship with the United States. Let me say again that this is a bad deal. If the members opposite say this is the best deal they could get, then I say they were not trying hard enough.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201904">My mother always said that we can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, but I want to give credit to the Standing Committee on International Trade. Committee members took a bad agreement and tried very hard to make it better. Some of the committee's recommendations included: advocating more time to conclude a final agreement that would meet the softwood industry's expectations; making sure to obtain an effective mechanism to resolve any disputes that may arise over the interpretation of that agreement; and upholding Canada's legal victories. I will say that again: upholding Canada's legal victories.</ParaText><ParaText id="201905">We have won a number of legal cases on this issue. It seems to me that when we have won such a number of cases, legally and morally, it is up to both of us to collect upon and enforce this decision. When we do not, we weaken the very reason we would go into arbitration.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="25">(1525)</Timestamp><ParaText id="201906">When awards are won and parties do not have to live up to the terms, future decisions are threatened and undermined. In this case, this could have far-reaching effects on various other aspects, not only in this industry but also in many other areas of government.</ParaText><ParaText id="201907">With this agreement, we are letting down our workers in the softwood lumber industry. Further, many other industries face similar trade problems. Therefore, through admitting defeat on this issue, we would be letting down many Canadians from coast to coast. Is this truly what the new government intended to do? </ParaText><ParaText id="201908">From having served for over 13 years in this House, I know my colleagues from every party are trying, to the very best of their abilities, to do the best jobs they can for Canadians. I truly I believe that. However, to not acknowledge the weakness of not enforcing awards is doing very serious damage. That is why it is so very important that we push the new government to try to get international trade rules upheld, acknowledged, accepted and enforced.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201909">The committee's recommendations did not stop there. The fact is that the committee's report also advocated a flexible ceiling under option B. It also advocated flexibility for those under option A. The aim was to ensure that the industry was not excessively penalized for sudden and temporary increases in exports to the United States. The Standing Committee on International Trade also recommended that every measure be taken to ensure that Canadian companies, with interest, would have their due share of countervailing and anti-dumping duties within 90 days of the conclusion of this agreement. These are only a few of the strong recommendations that the Standing Committee on International Trade made.</ParaText><ParaText id="201910">In the past election, the Conservative Party talked a lot about how important committees were. Conservatives talked about the fact that if they were elected, they would listen to the committees because they believed that the committees represented all parties, many points of view, and most of all, balance.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201911"> It is hard for me to understand, when the committee has come out with such very strong recommendations from an extremely rigorous examination of this issue, that the government essentially chooses to completely ignore that report. I am sorry for that. I, too, believe that balance is important in our decision making. We must be willing to weigh the pros and cons of every situation and we know, as parliamentarians, that our final solutions will not please everyone. They rarely, if ever, do, but we as parliamentarians must strive for that balance. We must hear all points of view and we must not tune them out, as the Conservatives are doing at this point.</ParaText><ParaText id="201912">I would ask the government to revisit that committee report and re-look at some of the committee's recommendations, which were put forth in good faith. I believe Canadians are looking for a government, no matter which party forms it, to give balance, to listen and, at the end of that process, to make the best possible decision for Canada and all Canadians. People want no less of the government. People are tired of the bickering, and I cannot say that enough. Every time I go into the riding, I hear how people are tired of parliamentarians bickering. They want us to work together for the best solution. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201913">This is an important file. We have worked on it for a long time together, perhaps some would say too long, undoubtedly. However, to sell out is not the proper way to go about this. When there are areas that have been hard fought and have been legally won, we should not abandon those victories.</ParaText><ParaText id="201914"> It is, indeed, a great challenge to try to not only protect this industry but to help ensure it flourishes. The softwood industry is an important part of Canada's economy, particularly in many rural parts of the country. We need to keep this industry strong to help both our national economy and the local economies of the communities where this industry is based.</ParaText><ParaText id="201915">The industry offers Canadians good jobs, jobs that we need.

The Liberals would have given up Atlantic Canada's hard fought for exemptions. The Liberals did not get those exemptions for the industry. Industry got them by proving to our American counterparts that our industry was on the same basis as theirs. Seventy-two per cent of all the land in Nova Scotia is privately owned. Our mills are exempt from countervail because of that. We do not subsidize the industry. It works on a free market basis, the same basis on which the American industry works. </ParaText><ParaText id="201936">The great thing about Bill <Document DbId="2334521" Type="3">C-24</Document> is that it allows flexibility, it allows for change and it allows for regional differences. </ParaText>

It recognizes regional differences. It recognizes an industry, to be perfectly frank, which was in a state of collapse because of the mismanagement of this file by the Liberal government.</ParaText><ParaText id="201938">What does the agreement do? It is good for Canada. It is good for the United States. It eliminates the punitive American duties. It returns more than $4.4 billion to producers. It provides stability for the industry.

The return of the $4.4 billion alone will benefit communities, workers, truckers, and the whole sawmill industry from coast to coast in this country. Our deposit refund mechanism has been developed with Export Development Canada and will allow Canadian companies to receive their share of deposits practically immediately, within four to eight weeks after entry into force of this agreement. </ParaText>

He more than anyone else worked to bring this agreement to fruition. He went through the tough slogging. As a former industry person he was able to talk on an equal level with his American counterparts. He knew what was required at the bargaining table. He worked for a just end for the softwood lumber industry right across Canada. He did not do that by pitting British Columbia against Nova Scotia. He did not do that by pitting Ontario against Quebec. He did it by bringing in an agreement that has flexibility and recognizes regional differences. Somehow our counterparts in the opposition cannot seem to wrap their heads around that. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201941">I can tell the House what would happen if we did not have this agreement. We would continue with litigation. The American industry is protectionist. No one is questioning that. We know it, and that is not going to change. We had to get the best agreement we could get. We had to get an agreement that would give surety to the industry and move forward from that point. If not, we would be stuck in litigation forever, and companies and sawmills, loggers and individuals, and communities and families would face devastation across this country.</ParaText><ParaText id="201942"> There are 600 communities that depend upon the softwood lumber industry to survive. I can guarantee that many of those communities would not survive this crisis without this agreement. If the NDP do not want to go along with it, fine.

Talking of rhetoric, we take no lectures or lessons from other sectors of the industry. British Columbia has a proud forestry tradition. My particular riding takes no lessons or lectures from anyone in the House when it comes to the pain and suffering that has gone on in the forestry sector over the last number of years.</ParaText><ParaText id="201962">We have watched families in distress. We watched the previous government not show up to the table with the loan guarantees. I know it is difficult for members to listen and to actually participate in the debate but they need to understand that when a government starts to spin on the dance of rhetoric and starts to talk about how other parties are playing politics all of a sudden, it is a good indication that the facts no longer support its cause.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201963">The response about the exemption to Atlantic Canada, that the intention was there but that the language was not, is absolutely dumbfounding to me and to many Canadians, both in Atlantic Canada and across the country. How could such an important concept as the exemption that was parroted and chirped across the country for Atlantic Canada not make it into the bill and have to be pointed out by other members in the House as opposed to the drafters of the bill, the government itself?</ParaText><ParaText id="201964"><Affiliation DbId="79026" Type="2">Skeena—Bulkley Valley</Affiliation>, in the northwest corner of British Columbia, which is 300,000 square kilometres and is the absolute heart and soul of the softwood industry in the country, understands the deal well. Just recently I was on a tour throughout the western part of my riding, some 900 kilometres on the road. We held open houses and discussions and allowed people to come in and comment. There was no bias on my part. We just simply sat and listened to what people in our communities had to say about the deal.</ParaText><ParaText id="201965">From across the political spectrum in my region, people who vote all different ways came with absolute disappointment and dismay at the inherent basic flaws communicated in this so-called agreement which, more and more, is a sellout. I wonder if the government has any excuses or reasons for the 3,000 people who just lost their jobs in Quebec and Ontario and the families that they support.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201966">The government just seemed so desperate in its need for victory. However, in April , on the very day the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> so proudly announced the deal, the Americans were filing more lawsuits against us. The government needed a victory so badly that it left $500 million in the hands of the American coalition, which has been hurting our communities for so long, to continue to fight us. Somehow the government has twisted itself into believing that it is a good idea, that it is a good idea to get smashed over the head year in and year out. </ParaText><ParaText id="201967">At the very end, last Friday the Court of International Trade found again for Canada, which is the final place for this decision to go, and Canadians need to know that. There is nowhere else to go for the coalition. However, the government has taken that victory away, has handed the Americans half a million bucks to beat us up some more later and has signed a deal that offers no certainty whatsoever.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201968"> I know members from the Conservative benches care for their communities, especially those members who have softwood industries in their ridings. I call upon them to stand in their place today and defend the principles of the bill because they need to be accountable. We have heard so much talk about accountability from the Conservative benches but when we come to a deal like this politics trumps common sense. Why would we leave a half a billion dollars behind for an industry that is dedicated to fighting against any notion of free trade?</ParaText><ParaText id="201969">The climate for investment in Canada has been destroyed by this deal. Why would an operator who operates on both sides of our borders have any notion of putting money into a mill in Canada when all they need to do is take their money back, place it into a U.S. mill and avoid a self-imposed tariff altogether? I have yet to hear an answer from the government.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201970">I have spoken to the mill managers and the people on the line and they do not get it. They do not understand why the provincial government in Victoria, British Columbia is so keen on raising the export of raw logs thereby raising the export of British Columbian jobs to other places. When I am in my riding I see the trucks drive right past the mills that have shut down and dump the logs in the water, boom them up and send them south.</ParaText>

It is much smarter to invest in the United States or just about anywhere else, because if you invest in Canada and you value add to any of the wood that Canadians produce, you will be hit with a tariff of up to 24% on your cost of production”. </ParaText><ParaText id="201972">I wish there were someone in the government who could simply answer that basic sense of economic disequilibrium that has been created by the government's one action, the tendency, the nature and the drive for industry to no longer invest in our country at a time when we have lost over 10,000 jobs in this sector. It is not as if we have any more blood to give. We have already given at work and at home. There is no space left in the industry other than its complete collapse. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201973">The true and deep concern I have in this debate is that for the government to secure some sort of improved relations with our American neighbours, which we all want to see, for that so-called victory it has signed a deal that allows Washington to interfere with provincial regulations on how we cut our own wood. This House of Commons does not have that right constitutionally but somehow we have just cut a deal that allows Washington to comment on our own forestry practices at the provincial level.</ParaText><ParaText id="201974">Many communities have been through so much, with thousands of jobs lost. I would invite members in this place to take a tour through my community and visit those places that have in excess of 90% unemployment. I wonder if anyone in this place can conceive of that in their hometowns, to go back home next week and find 80%, 85%, 90% of the people willing to work in their communities gone, simply unable to work. Imagine the social devastation, never mind the economics, we know that: schools closing down and hospitals no longer able to operate at a time when industries needed the support.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201975">The Conservatives were with us for a moment when we pleaded for loan guarantees for the industry but the previous government was unable to deliver. The Court of International Trade, the last place for the scoundrels who perpetuated this fraud upon Canadians and Canadian communities were heard, the court sided with Canada. Canada has sent our lawyers down to plead on behalf of the American cause. We are asking the court not to settle this case, to not award the entire $5.4 billion to Canada because we have this incredible deal that gives us foreign change, and which, by the way, perpetuates trade wars into the future.</ParaText><ParaText id="201976">It is not only remarkable that $500 million will end up in the coffers of the U.S. coalition's war chest to fight again, but it sends a disturbing signal to other industries that try to compete with Canada. What we are saying is that the Americans were right. They must have been right because why else would we leave money behind? We must subsidize our industry. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201977">Conservative members have stood in this place and made the argument that no, there is no softwood subsidy and we are not operating a subsidized system. However, by capitulating to them we are saying that they are right. If the Americans were able to end up with this much of the Canadian industries' money, we must be subsidizing. This opens up the floodgates to other industries that cannot compete.</ParaText><ParaText id="201978"> I only wish we could have some form of free trade. The lie has finally been put to that concept of free trade in this country. We only need to look at the way the Americans have handled themselves and the way that Canada has now decided to place itself in such an incredible position as to harm Canadian industry and communities by simply admitting, through this deal, that we must have a subsidized industry, and by putting in jeopardy all the other industries in Canada that now must try to compete with the Americans who we know are protectionists. We have seen it. The Conservatives just said so, and it is true. They will subsidize and they will protect. They will try to offer unfair competition to our industries, particularly in an industry like softwood where we know the Americans cannot compete.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="201979">Canadian mills are the most efficient in the world. I have those mills in my riding. I have visited those mills and we have talked to the foremen and the people running the shop. They know that they are running the best. All they want is a fair playing field and an opportunity to compete but instead they will be hit with a 24% duty on their wood. We are going to self-impose a duty when we have said that we are not subsidizing and that we are operating a fair game.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp><ParaText id="201980">The problems with this deal go on and on. A lot of Conservative members would like to ignore the fact that there is an actual cap on the amount of wood that can be produced. However, it is not done by company but by region. We have also assisted some of the larger companies that have the capacity to invest more money against some of the smaller ones because as soon as the cap is reached it hits everybody in that region. It does not hit the individual company that may have flooded a market. It hits everybody. Suddenly the cap goes up. The tipping point on this, the point where the tariffs start to be imposed, the price of a board foot of lumber has been below the trigger point for months. </ParaText><ParaText id="201981">This is an opportunity for the government to finally stand up and admit some of the absolute flaws in this agreement. We each need to stand up and represent our communities, which is what we were sent here to do. We were sent here to represent the people who work every day or who are trying to get back to work.

It seems he was actually calling for us to fall in line with the desires of the American industry, the American government and the American protectionists. It is a very sad turnabout and a very dramatic one. It is a capitulation to those interests that have been working so hard to destroy the Canadian industry and with it Canadian communities and Canadian jobs. </ParaText><ParaText id="202003">It is so ironic that the<Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1"> Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s reversal comes at a time when a just and fair victory for Canada was in sight. It has been said many times that this agreement and this legislation actually snatches defeat from the jaws of victory. That is exactly what is happening here. </ParaText><ParaText id="202004">Unfortunately, the victory that Canada was on the verge of has been lost because of this proposal and this legislation. That is why it is a bad deal for Canada, a bad deal for British Columbia, and certainly a bad deal for my home riding of <Affiliation DbId="78519" Type="2">Burnaby—Douglas</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202005">The ironies continue. It was just last Friday afternoon that another court case was decided in Canada's favour. That case before the U.S. Court of International Trade, CIT, found in Canada's favour. That court said that every last penny of the $5.3 billion of illegally imposed duties on softwood lumber exports over the years had to be returned to Canada. That money was taken from Canadian companies, Canadian communities and Canadian workers. That court said every last cent had to be returned. This was just last Friday where there was yet another victory in the courts.</ParaText><ParaText id="202006">Indeed, we were running out of court opportunities. We were getting down to the wire on every last one of them. Incredibly, it was Canada's Ambassador to the United States, Michael Wilson, when he was before committee this summer who said the opportunities for court action on this were coming to an end. We were absolutely on the verge of a wholesale victory on this issue in the courts. Unfortunately, that has all been thrown by the wayside by this agreement and this legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="202007">I want to come back to the speech I had hoped to deliver the first time around and some of the points that I did not have time to talk about. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202008">If this is such a great deal for Canada and for the Canadian industry, I have to wonder why page after page of this bill is devoted to punitive measures to punish Canadian businesses that do not comply or do not agree with this legislation. If this was such a great deal for Canada and for Canadian businesses and communities, why has such emphasis been placed on punitive measures in the legislation?</ParaText><ParaText id="202009">I was surprised to hear in this House last month a Conservative member from Atlantic Canada say that the government would have to pursue an amendment to its own legislation because the wording of the maintenance of the Maritime lumber exemption was not strong enough or clear enough, and did not actually use the word “exemption”. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp><ParaText id="202010">It is hard to believe that on a part of this whole controversy where there is absolute agreement in every corner of this House around the need to maintain the Atlantic Canada exemption, that the government could not even get the wording right in this legislation on that aspect of the bill. It could not even get it right when everyone agrees how important that is. It could not get it right when its representatives from Atlantic Canada were so involved to maintain this exemption.</ParaText><ParaText id="202011">I think that is another example of how bad this bill really is. If there is a point where there is no controversy, where there is a clear agreement and where the language has been accepted for some time, why that language could not even make it into this legislation is beyond me. If the government cannot do it on that front, what is happening on the other clauses that are more controversial and more complicated?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202012">Another important flaw in this legislation is that it does nothing to address the serious issue of the export of raw logs. One observer of the forest industry in British Columbia, and someone who has carefully poured over the agreement and the 82 page appendices to the agreement, notes that this legislation goes out of its way to be specific about what is covered, about what aspects of the softwood lumber industry are covered. In fact, he says it is dizzying in its specificity. He also says:</ParaText><ParaText id="202013"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Taxes will apply to “coniferous wood, sawn or chipped lengthwise, sliced or peeled, whether or not planed, sanded or finger-jointed, of a thickness exceeding six millimetres”. In similar minutiae, wood siding, flooring and fencing are discussed.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="202014">That is all very well, but not once in this agreement and in this legislation does the word “log” appear. We know that the export of raw logs is a serious issue facing the industry. It is certainly a serious issue for the industry in British Columbia.</ParaText><ParaText id="202015">To fail to close a loophole around the export of raw logs from private lands is a huge failure. It gives raw logs from private lands a competitive edge over logs processed, for instance, in British Columbia.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202016">This will discourage value added production and jobs in B.C. and will stimulate more raw log exports to the United States where workers will process them. It robs Canada and Canadian workers of opportunities and jobs. Jim Sinclair, the president of the B.C. Federation of Labour, has pointed out that:</ParaText><ParaText id="202017"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">More than 3,300 jobs in the forest sector were lost to log exports in 2005 alone and an estimated 27 mills closed at a cost of 13,000 jobs between 1997 and 2004.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="202018">This is work that should have remained in Canada, with Canadian workers and in Canadian communities. It is an absolute travesty that this has been allowed to happen. It is further unbelievable that this opportunity to deal with this issue has slipped through our fingers and another reason why this is a bad deal.</ParaText><ParaText id="202019">When we add those jobs lost to raw log exports, as the president of the B.C. Federation of Labour pointed out, when we look at the fact that 3,000 jobs have been lost in the last week in the forest industry alone, we come to realize just how bad this legislation and this deal truly is.</ParaText><ParaText id="202020">Bill <Document DbId="2334521" Type="3">C-24</Document> also subjects any change in provincial forest policy to approval by the United States. It is incredible that we would give up our sovereignty in that way.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202021">I think that Steve Hunt, the United Steelworkers Western Canadian director, said something that is very instructive with regard to this. He said:</ParaText><ParaText id="202022"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">This deal doesn't need tweaking, it needs a complete rewrite.

We are already beginning to see some of the results of this play itself out in the thousands and thousands of jobs that are disappearing. Communities are being affected across the country, particularly my region of northern Ontario.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202039">Before I get to that, I want to share this with the folks who are watching. What we are involved with this afternoon is really a process of closure, or ending debate in the House. The government saw that we, as a party, were very concerned about the impact of the agreement on our constituents. It knew we would to speak to it for as long as it took to get all our thoughts on the record and to challenge the government as effectively as we could. This place is all about that. We are here to ask the government to consider amendments to a bill that might improve it and make it better.</ParaText><ParaText id="202040"> However, the government brought in closure. It forced votes in the House on an amendment we brought forward. It forced votes in the House on an amendment the Liberals brought forward. Now we are at a point where there will be no further amendments or opportunities for us, as elected members of the House, to bring forward suggestions that might make the bill, or agreement, better, if that is possible, or to speak on behalf of our constituents in that way.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202041">We are here in this place on Tuesday afternoon, speaking to a bill which the government wants to ram it through. That has been the government's approach to this from the very beginning. The minister was brought across the floor from the Liberals, I suppose because he had some history and some experience with this, to find a way to put together a deal with the Americans, a deal which ignores all the legal decisions made over a number of months and years in our favour. I guess it has been done to curry favour with the Americans. When the governing party was in opposition, there was a sense that the relationship with that country was not as good as it would like it to have been.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202042"> I served for 13 years in the Ontario provincial legislature at Queen's Park. I remember this very same closure procedure being used over and over again. From 1995 to 2003, the Conservative government introduced motion after motion. This changed the landscape of that province. The current government is beside itself now on how it can recover some of the wonderful programs that had been put in place, over a number of years, by varying political stripes. These programs improved the lot of communities, families and people. They were put in place to protect industry and the economy of various regions and to turn the province into an industrial heartland, which was the envy of the rest of the country. The Conservatives turned it into a province that is now struggling from one day to the next to support education, health care and all those programs that we know are necessary if we are meet the challenge of participating in the new global economy.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202043">I remember Thursday afternoons because I was usually on duty. Some of my colleagues and I would spend a couple of hours in the legislature debating a closure motion. We are not debating a closure motion here, but the process that we are engaged in is in fact a process of closure.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp><ParaText id="202044">One cannot be anything but disappointed that the members of the Conservative Party are not standing to speak on behalf of their constituents. They know as well as we do the impact this is having on them. </ParaText><ParaText id="202045">Since a lot of them come from rural and northern Canada, within their constituencies, they must have small communities that are being affected dramatically and negatively by this agreement. They must be affected by the government's unwillingness to support the industry in its legal challenges, challenges that were successful and within a whisker of forcing the issue of making the free trade agreement work. Many of us had some concerns about the free trade agreement when it was first brought in, but we learned to work with it in the interests of our industry and jurisdictions. </ParaText><ParaText id="202046">The Conservatives have not taken the time in this place to get up and speak to this agreement. They are not taking the time to talk on behalf of their constituents and communities that are being hammered. Even if it does not affect people directly, it sets a precedent. It creates a pattern. It sends a message on how the government will stand up and fight for other interests for a region that is resource based. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202047">I do not have to look any further than what is going in western Canada right now with regard to the Canadian Wheat Board. This is a vehicle that farmers themselves decided to put together, fund and run in order to get the best value for their investments, for the work they put in and for the products they produced. The Wheat Board has been a successful vehicle over a number of years now. Literally thousands of farmers, who are behind the Wheat Board and support it, are aghast that the government is being so aggressive in doing away with it. They are surprised.</ParaText><ParaText id="202048">I attended a meeting in Saskatoon this summer of some 250 to 300 farmers. It was held across the street from a very secretive closed door meeting, by invitation only, of supporters of the government who saw this as their opportunity to do in a vehicle that they had ideological differences with for quite some time. The farmers I met with said that nobody was speaking for them. Nobody was bringing their voice to this place to challenge the government on doing away with the very vehicle they put in place to protect their interests, investments and products and to be able sell them for highest value in the marketplace.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202049">I am disappointed that Conservatives are not standing up to speak on behalf of the communities involved in forestry. I am disappointed they do not recognize the impact of this on those communities. In my own area of Algoma in northern Ontario, people pick up the newspaper every day to see that another mill has closed down somewhere, whether it is Nairn Centre, Espanola, Dubreuilville, White River. The list goes on and on. That is just northeastern Ontario. </ParaText><ParaText id="202050">In northwestern Ontario it is even worse. NDP members met with the leaders of northwestern Ontario a couple of weeks ago when we were in Thunder Bay for our caucus retreat. They shared with us the very devastating reality that confronts them every day. The forestry coalition and leaderships of those communities talked about mill closings. They said that when a mill closed, they would lose population, the value of property would go down and nobody wanted to set up shop. There is instability and no confidence any more in those communities. People do not want to invest in a small business because they do not know what the future will be. It is up in the air.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202051">I hear from people in the communities in my area and in northwestern Ontario. I am surprised Conservative members are not speaking on behalf of their regions, communities or people because they have to be experiencing the same thing. It cannot be just in northern Ontario, northeastern Ontario or northwestern Ontario. I know it is happening in other areas. Members of my caucus, who have spoken on behalf of their constituents and communities, have said that this is already having a devastating effect.</ParaText>

Many forestry workers have already lost their jobs. There is a very real need for education and training funds, for pension bridging, for assistance to older workers who may not be able to find employment, and for some recognition that many workers will also need assistance in relocating to other communities. We need an active transition fund in place.</ParaText><ParaText id="202078">There used to be a program called industrial adjustment, which worked closely with industry, labour and communities when communities were going through transitions. The federal government cut that very good program a number of years ago. There is now no mechanism to get that kind of community driven process. It is the community driven process that can talk about the problems in the community and identify the very concrete solutions that will make a difference.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202079">The other piece that is missing is the whole issue around loan guarantees to industry. We know industry is suffering right now with the lack of certainty in the softwood lumber field. It was incumbent on the past Liberal government and certainly is on the current Conservative government to look for a loan guarantee program that would help industry over this very difficult period. Because no matter what, whether this agreement goes through or not, by the time industry gets cheques in their hands, some of these industry players will already have closed their doors. Then where will the help be for communities suffering from the transition?</ParaText><ParaText id="202080">There are a couple of other issues I want to touch on in today's debate. I am sure other members have quoted from the article I will mention, but I have a direct link to my own community about this. It says that the softwood deal will spur more raw log exports. It is an article written by Ben Parfitt from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. He says:</ParaText><ParaText id="202081"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Nearly two-thirds of the 82-agreement is appendices, including one outlining which Canadian products are subject to export taxes.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="202082"> It is a “dizzying” list, he says. He talks specifically about a glaring omission:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202083"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Throughout the appendix, however, one searches in vain for the word “logs”. Yet the on-again, off-again dispute with the US has always been about how provincial governments price publicly owned trees, not whether they somehow underwrote the costs of specific manufacturing processes.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="202084">Later on in the article he talks about a “flash forward”. This is really critical for my riding:</ParaText><ParaText id="202085"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Flash forward. Despite the policy changes, the US insists with the current deal on capping our market access. And Canada and BC--to their lasting discredit--have agreed. Once the caps are exceeded, costly export taxes kick in. Except, that is, on logs. Now look at BC's coast. One company--Western Forest Products--directly controls nearly half the logs on public forestlands. It, along with other coastal companies, already has log export approvals from the province.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp><ParaText id="202086"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Now, thanks to the scrapping of provisions linking forest tenures to sawmills, we face the prospect of increased log exports should further coastal sawmills, as is widely anticipated, close. And why wouldn't they? The “reward” for processing US-bound lumber may be a 15 per cent tax when certain export or price thresholds are exceeded. The corresponding tax on logs is zero.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="202087">I have raised that issue because in my riding raw log exports have been a major, major problem for a number of years. There has been a valiant and diligent group of people called the Youbou Timberless Society, a group that sprung up as a result of the Youbou mill closing four years ago. A great number of the people from the Youbou mill never did find permanent full time employment again, which has had an incredible effect on the community of Youbou and the surrounding area of the Cowichan Valley.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202088">One of the chief proponents behind the Youbou Timberless Society is a man by the name of Ken James. These people have been working very hard over a number of years to raise the awareness of the impact of raw log exports on our community and other communities on Vancouver Island and in British Columbia. They decided to count the number of trucks that were leaving the area with logs. They did a tally on Highway 18, between Lake Cowichan and Duncan, and tallied 157 logging trucks in 10 hours.</ParaText><ParaText id="202089"> Over four days, from 6:30 a.m. until 4:30 p.m., Youbou Timberless Society members counted slightly less than 1,000 trucks in my riding, 1,000 trucks loaded with logs. Not all of them were leaving the riding, but many of them were leaving the riding with logs to be processed somewhere else.</ParaText><ParaText id="202090">Where is the responsibility to our community to make sure that the resources from our community are processed closer to home, producing jobs so that people can support their families and pay taxes? As we know, people who make a good dollar actually pay taxes and are the ones who fuel our economy. They are the ones who make sure our hospitals and our schools stay open. They are the ones who make sure our roads get paved. It seems reasonable and fair that we actually look for ways to make sure that we process the resources from our proud province and from our grand country of Canada as close to home as possible.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202091">Later on in that same article, again quoting James, statistics quoted show a corresponding rise in raw log exports from about a half a million cubic metres in the early 1990s to an annual three million cubic metres since the provincial Liberals took power in 2001. That is an outrageous increase in resources leaving our community and our province. That is a direct loss of jobs and of quality of life.</ParaText><ParaText id="202092">One of the other items that is omitted, really, in this softwood lumber agreement is first nations. On August 10, the First Nations Leadership Council wrote a letter about the Canada-United States softwood lumber agreement, stating: </ParaText><ParaText id="202093"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">--the new SLA [softwood lumber agreement] makes only one reference to First Nations in Article XVII anti-circumvention item 2.(f)...payments or other compensation to First Nations for the purposes of addressing or settling claims....</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="202094">That is it. That is the only mention of first nations in the softwood lumber agreement.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202095">That is an important issue in British Columbia, because of course in British Columbia, as many members of this House are well aware, there are extensive treaty negotiations under way. Some of them have been under way for decades and one can only dream that they would actually get settled in our lifetime.</ParaText><ParaText id="202096">The fact is that there are these treaty negotiations under way and many of them are not nearly close to being settled. The leadership council had asked, given the new relationships and transformative change accord and a number of other unresolved land questions, that there be some consideration in the softwood lumber agreement, and in discussions leading up to it, of the impact on first nations in British Columbia. Of course that was not done. There seems little opportunity at this point in time to do it.</ParaText><ParaText id="202097"> This is one of the things that public hearings would have helped to address. It would have given first nations leadership an opportunity to appear before the standing committee to talk about the impact on their communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="202098">I urge this House to reject this flawed agreement. I urge this House to look for creative solutions which would ensure that our communities stay healthy and viable, that we retain the right to process our resources close to home and that we retain the say over our industry.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It seems to like to do that. Its rush to appease the U.S. lumber lobbyists has sold out ordinary Canadians, especially those who live and work in forest dependent communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="202156">The other irony about all of this is that about $500 million of Canadian money will go to the U.S. That is $.5 billion to the Coalition for Fair Lumber Imports.

This falsehood was exposed and rejected in every NAFTA and U.S. commercial court ruling that clearly sided with Canadian industry.</ParaText><ParaText id="202159">Another reason this is a bad deal is that it can be cancelled unilaterally at any time. It does not go on for seven years. It could last only two years or even 18 months and does not provided stability and predictability to the Canadian softwood lumber industry. This deal constrains trade unreasonably by applying punitive tariffs and quotas that hinder the flexibility of the Canadian softwood industry. </ParaText><ParaText id="202160">I want to talk about a small flooring manufacturing company in my riding that is devastated by this agreement. It has told me it is going to be losing over $300,000 a year in revenues because it cannot find a way under this deal as it stands to do business with the U.S. It is going to be shut out. It is a small company and is going to lose out because of this deal.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp><ParaText id="202161">It will be the dozen or so people who work in small businesses in my community who will probably lose their jobs if this deal goes ahead. Small businesses are very concerned about their future. It is a bad deal because it does not respect small businesses.</ParaText><ParaText id="202162">The deal kills the credibility of the NAFTA dispute settlement mechanism. Canada won in the courts but by negotiating away all of those wins we have put the dispute mechanism in jeopardy. We might as well say that we did not need it. We capitulate in a heartbeat.</ParaText><ParaText id="202163">It sets a bad precedent, not only for the softwood lumber industry, but also for other industrial sectors in this country. If the government can capitulate to the Americans on softwood, what can it do in other sectors that are governed by NAFTA? Will we see this again in other industries? It is a bad deal.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202164">The deal does nothing for the thousands of workers who have lost their livelihoods over the past five years. My colleagues and I in the NDP called for loan guarantees from the government so that the industries in our communities could get through this and maintain some of the workers. However, that did not happen. Many of the industries had to lay off workers and many are now gone because of this deal. We also see a further job loss through consolidation caused by the quotas and export taxes. </ParaText><ParaText id="202165">I have another reason for talking about this agreement. This softwood lumber agreement creates an incentive for exporting raw logs. I live on Vancouver Island and I when I drive up and down the Island highway I see truckload after truckload of raw logs leaving the Island and going to a log dump. We used to have a lot of small mills, mills that were the backbone and the lifeblood of so many small communities. These mills kept those communities going because the logs were tied to the communities. This is not happening any more. This deal does nothing to stop these logs from being exported out of our communities and out of the country. The logs are being processed offshore and in the U.S. Those are family supporting jobs that we have lost in our communities. That is not standing up for our communities.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202166">This continued export of raw logs has to stop. I have spoken about this in my communities and everywhere I go people agree that this is something that has to end. For that reason alone, I would think that people would not support this deal.</ParaText><ParaText id="202167">This deal does not provide effective protection for Atlantic Canada. The softwood lumber agreement has a fundamental and irreversible impact on the ability of Canada to defend itself within NAFTA and the United States commercial court system. The agreement makes everyone substantially more vulnerable, notwithstanding the Atlantic exemption. The renewal of the exemption is not a guarantee against failure in the future. The Atlantic provinces are still vulnerable to subsidy allegations. There will be nothing to stop the U.S. from alleging that Atlantic Canadians are not living up to this deal.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202168">This is a bad deal because I know much of the industry was not on side. It was pressured into supporting this deal and a lot of bullying tactics went on. Many industries felt forced into signing on to this deal. A lot of them actually did not sign on, but were pressured anyway. I am really standing up for those people in those industries, for the workers in our communities and for the communities in my riding and across this country that will be devastated by this deal.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Since his initial election to the House of Commons in 1997, the member has been persistent and vigilant in ensuring issues surrounding the welfare of Canada's children remain on Parliament's agenda.</ParaText><ParaText id="202194">One highlight of his ongoing advocacy includes his private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="1508188" Type="4">C-313</Document>, from the 38th Parliament. That bill would have amended the Criminal Code to raise the age of consent from 14 to 16 years of age. Although that particular legislation was unsuccessful, chiefly due to the previous government's opposition, it helped draw national attention to the age of consent issue and it also crystallized in the minds of many Canadians the need for a new approach in Ottawa toward criminal justice, especially where our children are concerned.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202195">I am proud to report that, unlike the previous government, this Conservative government and this <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> are committed to comprehensive criminal justice reform, including raising the age of consent between children and adults from 14 to 16 years of age. As we move forward in implementing this necessary change, I would like to recognize the member for <Affiliation DbId="78882" Type="2">Lethbridge</Affiliation> for his laudable contribution and, on behalf of Canada's children and their parents, thank him.</ParaText><ParaText id="202196">That brings us to the matter under debate here today, legislation which again deals with an issue important to the welfare of children. It involves difficult and emotional matters. It deals with those parts of life we do not necessarily bring up in casual conversations. When we talk about these matters we tend to do so in hushed tones, with long pauses and guarded expressions: Death and divorce.</ParaText><ParaText id="202197">These are not parts of life we anticipate in any great measure, only accept for we have no choice. While there is the rare exception, these events are saturated in the most wrenching of human emotions for all those involved. This is particularly true for young children. For it goes without saying that neither the break-up of a parent's marriage or the death of a parent are elements we associate with the carefree innocence of childhood. It is a cruel coincidence of fate that would visit both such events on a child, but the destiny of fate knows not of the sorrow it inflicts. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202198">While death is inevitable, the end of a marriage is not, but it is today a distinct possibility. A divorce is not a flippant decision for most people. It represents the lamentable end of earlier promise. Some are mutual and amicable, others are bitter and acrimonious.</ParaText><ParaText id="202199">According to Statistics Canada, each year approximately 70,000 couples will get a divorce. Furthermore, today almost 40% of marriages will end in divorce by the 30th wedding anniversary. I would like to say that I beat that anniversary.</ParaText><ParaText Interjection="e1" id="202200"><Affiliation DbId="78477" Type="2">Mr. Paul Szabo: </Affiliation> How many?</ParaText><ParaText id="202201"><Affiliation DbId="78951">Mrs. Lynne Yelich: </Affiliation> Over 30 years with the same man.</ParaText><ParaText id="202202">With the end of marriage, the difficult questions surrounding custody of dependants have to be attended to. </ParaText><ParaText id="202203">Again the tender of such proceedings can vary, and sometimes custody arrangements will limit the access of one parent to a child. This is not exceptional in itself for it occurs daily in courtrooms throughout the country. The exceptional occurrence, what Bill <Document DbId="2153838" Type="4">C-252</Document> seeks to address, is the conditions or privileges granted to a terminally ill or a critical condition parent. The bill before us today seeks to grant such a parent access to their child in this difficult period.</ParaText><ParaText id="202204">Adding subsection (11) to section 16, custody orders, of the Divorce Act, the proposed subsection reads:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202205"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Subject to subsection (8), in making an order under this section, the court shall ensure that a spouse who is terminally ill or in critical condition is granted access to a child of the marriage. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp><ParaText id="202206">I would like to draw attention to the House a key provision drafted in that amendment which has the effect of ensuring that such access is granted provided it is in the best interests of the child involved.</ParaText><ParaText id="202207">Proposed subsection (11) is subject to subsection (8), which reads, “In making an order under this section, the court shall take into consideration only the best interests of the child of the marriage as determined by reference to the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the child”. A child would consequently be shielded from possibly being returned to the custody of a parent who may have, or may again, inflict any harm upon the child. </ParaText><ParaText id="202208">I believe this provision speaks to the fact that the bill seeks to strike a proper balance between parental rights and child protection. Providing a legally entrenched avenue for a dying parent to have access to their child to say a last goodbye with the provision I just mentioned is the decent thing to do.</ParaText><ParaText id="202209">I cannot, nor do I wish to, imagine facing the prospect of being prevented from looking into the eyes of one's child the last time before the hour of death. More important, robbing a child of such a moment, that final reassurance everything will be all right, is not something that should be facilitated by the state.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202210">The English poet Matthew Arnold wrote, “Truth sits upon the lips of dying men”. Most would hold this to be an intrinsic truth. As difficult as it may be to the parent and child, the period before one's expected death represents a final opportunity to impart what a mother or father holds to be true to their child.</ParaText><ParaText id="202211">The language of the dying is usually stripped of generalities and devoid of excess of words, especially when spoken from a parent to their child. There is typically an economy of words used, not because of a lack of things to say, but to ensure the impact of those few spoken are magnified to the fullest extent, often simply limited to three. </ParaText><ParaText id="202212">The anguish of a child following the death of a parent is inevitable and it is natural. As legislators we have no power or desire to avert that. However, ensuring the welfare of children is not simply limited to sheltering them from harm, but also allowing them the experiences of life.</ParaText><ParaText id="202213">Bill <Document DbId="2153838" Type="4">C-252</Document> can assist in a small way by permitting recourse for parental access at this sensitive time.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202214">In psychology the term “closure” refers to a state of experiencing an emotional conclusion to a difficult life event like the death of a loved one. Bill <Document DbId="2153838" Type="4">C-252</Document> will not bring closure, for as the Canadian journalist Robert Fulford once argued that closure cannot be achieved consciously. One cannot arbitrarily shorten the length of time it takes to soften the edges of grief, and this is especially true for a child. But there is solace and comfort inherent to acts of finality, such as the solemn moments of farewell with a dying loved one which, with the passage of time, contribute to the process of closure.</ParaText><ParaText id="202215">On that basis, I ask my colleagues to support unanimously Bill <Document DbId="2153838" Type="4">C-252</Document> proposed by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78882" Type="2">Lethbridge</Affiliation>.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We are not planning to make a habit of it, but when sensible and balanced bills come along, we are always happy to cooperate, especially where private members' bills are concerned. A member can really show the full extent of his or her talent with legislation like that. In my caucus, I have always maintained that debate on private members' bills should not be limited to one hour; instead, two hours a day should be allocated to debating these bills. I think that would be one way to enhance the role of MPs.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202218">That having been said, Bill <Document DbId="2153838" Type="4">C-252</Document> deals with the Divorce Act. Members might remember that, for a long time, divorce was pretty unusual. There was even a time, long ago, when an application had to be made to the Senate or a private bill had to be introduced for a divorce to be granted. In time, divorce has become much more mainstream. In terms of division of powers, one could of course find it somewhat illogical that Quebec has jurisdiction over separation from bed and board and matters relating to civil law, but not divorce. In fact, every Quebec premier from Daniel Johnson to Jean Lesage, and from René Lévesque to Jean Charest has traditionally called for divorce to fall under the responsibility of the Government of Quebec, through its National Assembly. This way, we would have full and complete, integrated and consistent jurisdiction over family matters, even though divorce is admittedly something that is always painful for someone to go through.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202219"> What the bill introduced by our colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78882" Type="2">Lethbridge</Affiliation> proposes is to amend section 16 of the Divorce Act, which provides for custody orders. Increasingly divorces take place by mutual agreement and the divorce process is not judicialized. There are nevertheless legal and administrative matters that require court intervention. The granting of custody is one of these matters.</ParaText><ParaText id="202220"> Section 16 of the Divorce Act says that a court of competent jurisdiction—in Quebec, this is the Superior Court—may, on application by either or both spouses or any other person, make an order respecting the custody of or the access to, or the custody and access to, any or all children of the marriage. This is subsection 1 of section 16.</ParaText><ParaText id="202221"> Subsection 2 also says that the court may, on application by either or both spouses or by any other person, make an interim order respecting the custody of or the access to, or the custody of and access to, any or all of the children of the marriage, pending determination of the application.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202222"> What is also important is that, in our divorce legislation, the issue of the children’s interests has always been extremely central. The wish is for the courts, when deciding on shared custody, access and visitation, to do so in the light of the child’s best interests.</ParaText><ParaText id="202223"> There is extremely important jurisprudence defining what are the child’s interests with respect to his development, emotional stability, growth and education. That is why, contrary to what our fellow citizens think, custody of a child is never automatic. There is always a set of factors that must be assessed by the court. What is central are the child’s best interests.</ParaText><ParaText id="202224"> A few years ago, this Parliament created a committee to review the whole issue of children. For the Bloc Québécois, it was the member for <Affiliation DbId="78655" Type="2">Longueuil—Pierre-Boucher</Affiliation> who sat on the committee. The committee again specified, confirmed and reconfirmed that the child’s interests, the child’s best interests with respect to his development, emotional stability, growth and education, must be central to the Divorce Act. Among the factors that a court of justice has to evaluate, this one must be paramount.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="45">(1745)</Timestamp><ParaText id="202225">Subsection 16(10) of the Divorce Act states, and I believe it is worth quoting:</ParaText><ParaText id="202226"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">In making an order under this section, the court shall give effect to the principle that a child of the marriage should have as much contact with each spouse as is consistent with the best interests of the child and, for that purpose, shall take into consideration the willingness of the person for whom custody is sought to facilitate such contact.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="202227">We must therefore not assume that the courts will favour one parent over the other. It is established in our laws and set out in the legislation: we recognize that the child should maintain contact as much as possible with both parents, and that it is the responsibility of the parent who has primary custody to facilitate visiting with the other parent.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202228">I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate our colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78882" Type="2">Lethbridge</Affiliation> on his new responsibilities, since he was elected chair of the sugar caucus. In fact, he and I both have refineries in our ridings. The sugar industry is extremely important and we see a threat on the horizon. The previous Liberal government wanted to negotiate an agreement with Central American countries to bring in even more sugar duty free. Obviously, that creates a problem in terms of competition, particularly concerning production costs for the large refineries in our regions. We will see if the current government also wants to pursue those negotiations.</ParaText><ParaText id="202229">So, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78882" Type="2">Lethbridge</Affiliation> has new responsibilities and I would like to assure him that I will be at his side when the time comes to defend the sugar industry.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202230"> The hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78882" Type="2">Lethbridge</Affiliation> has proposed adding a subsection to section 16. This new provision, probably the result of representations made to him by some of his fellow citizens, would constitute subsection 16(11), and would read as follows: </ParaText><ParaText id="202231"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Subject to subsection (8), in making an order under this section, the court shall ensure that a spouse who is terminally ill or in critical condition is granted access to a child of the marriage. </QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText><ParaText id="202232"> The hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78882" Type="2">Lethbridge</Affiliation> must have received representations from parents living with an incurable or debilitating disease or a degenerative disorder that was an obstacle in the evaluation of their custody rights by a judge or the Superior Court in Quebec’s case. </ParaText><ParaText id="202233"> We all know that a person should not be deprived of access to a child of his marriage because of a health problem. To the contrary, this should be a facilitating consideration. The provision suggested by the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78882" Type="2">Lethbridge</Affiliation> leads us to support this amendment. </ParaText><ParaText id="202234"> The best interests of the child must still be the core of all legal decisions. That is in section 16 of the act. This is how the law has evolved. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202235"> We know very well, though, that it would be sad. It is already difficult enough to have health problems and this should not be a reason. So long as other conditions are present in the family environment, the health setbacks of the child’s father or mother should not be a reason to stop encouraging contact with this parent, a fruitful relationship that might be an end-of-life relationship for one of the parents. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="50">(1750)</Timestamp><ParaText id="202236"> We know the comfort a child can provide.</ParaText><ParaText id="202237"> We are going to support this bill in principle. If the House so desires, it will be referred to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. This committee has quite a bit on its plate right now because the Conservative government has introduced seven bills with very different prospects. Most deserve to be voted down, but the Bloc Québécois will give this one a lot of consideration.</ParaText><ParaText id="202238"> I wish the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78882" Type="2">Lethbridge</Affiliation> the best of luck.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Siksay" id="1701136"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78519" Type="2">Mr. Bill Siksay (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="202239">Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to participate in the debate this afternoon on Bill <Document DbId="2153838" Type="4">C-252, an act to amend the Divorce Act (access for spouse who is terminally ill or in critical condition)</Document>. </ParaText><ParaText id="202240">The NDP supported the amendment that the member for <Affiliation DbId="78882" Type="2">Lethbridge</Affiliation> brought to his private member's bill. NDP members had some concerns about the original private member's bill, but we are pleased to see that in his amendment he took into consideration many of the concerns that were raised in the first hour of debate and in discussions with other members of the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="202241">It is a much better proposal in its current form and I look forward to it going to the justice committee for further discussion and perhaps improvement there, although I share the concerns of the member for <Affiliation DbId="78559" Type="2">Hochelaga</Affiliation> about the workload of the justice committee. It is extremely significant at the moment and I hope the bill gets the attention that it deserves when it goes to committee. I hope it has that opportunity.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202242">NDP members had some serious concerns with the original bill. Our concerns stemmed mainly around the fact that it seemed to mandate a visit of a child and a terminally or critically ill parent. The language “to ensure that a spouse who was terminally ill or in critical condition is granted access to a child” was of great concern to us. That language flies in the face of the experience of Canadian jurisprudence and families who have faced the situation of divorce and visitation rights over the last many years. Children were not forced in those circumstances to make those kinds of visits, even in that circumstance.</ParaText><ParaText id="202243">I had concerns with the original wording, but there is some improvement now in the amendment. It clearly recognizes the importance of the best interests of the child in consideration of arranging such a visit when there is a terminal illness or a critical condition.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202244">I am not sure the bill, as amended, really changes the practice of our system now. I am sure that critical or terminal illness could be considered a change of circumstance and would amount to a court hearing arguments around a change in visitation rights. I do not think there is a significant change in the practice and would hope that any court confronted with that situation and the serious concerns about someone whose life is coming to an end might consider this an important reason to revisit the issue of visitation rights. I am sure in most instances that would be the case.</ParaText><ParaText id="202245">I am not sure this significantly changes the current practice, but if it clarifies it and draws attention to the importance of that circumstance, then perhaps there is no harm in doing this. The key in all of this is that whatever decision is made it be made in the child's best interest. This has been the long established practice and importance of these considerations in the system.</ParaText><ParaText id="202246">There are concerns about defining the age of a child with regard to this legislation. We have seen in the past that courts have absolutely refused to order a child 12 years or older to visit a parent when that child has refused to do so. That is a rough rule of thumb for the court, according to my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78397" Type="2">Windsor—Tecumseh</Affiliation>, but is something that we need to take into consideration.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202247">I believe there has been an established precedent that children should have some say in the requirement to visit a parent and that probably applies in any circumstance, including one where there is terminal or critical illness. To move to a situation of requiring such a visit of a child would be a serious problem. Children over 12 certainly have the maturity to decide if they are willing to visit a parent or not. In further discussion of the bill, we have to ensure that this is one of the things that is a serious consideration.</ParaText><ParaText id="202248">It is very clear that visitation rights in Canada are rights of the child, not of the parent. The key factor is that the best interests of the child must guide the court in making a determination. When those visitation rights are enforced or ordered, this still needs to be the key consideration. The rights of the child and what is in the best interest of the child in the circumstances need to be taken into account. That has to have a prime place in the considerations here, even in these difficult circumstances. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="55">(1755)</Timestamp><ParaText id="202249">I think it is fair to say that all of us would like to see terminally ill people have the ability to perhaps have a last visit with their child. We can all understand why that might be important to someone. However, I do not think there should be a compulsion on a child, especially an older child, to do that nor do I think the need of a terminally ill person to have that final visit should necessarily trump the best interests of the child in this case.</ParaText><ParaText id="202250">Unfortunately, we know, even at the time of terminal or critical illness, that often people can be as manipulative as they have been at other points in their lives. It is not always a completely altruistic moment in our lives. To make an exception in the case of that circumstance around visitation rights would be a serious problem. This is something that still merits the attention of the committee and members as the bill is discussed further at committee.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202251">It is important that the discretion of the court is maintained in these circumstances. This is why I would argue against the use of words like “ensure” or other words that access is granted. This kind of hard and fast language may impede the ability of the court to take into consideration all the factors that may come into play in a circumstance like this. We want to ensure that every possible circumstance and issue is brought to the attention of the court and discussed in the circumstance of the child, the family and the parents.</ParaText><ParaText id="202252">It is very important that we maintain the discretion of the courts to deal with these circumstances. While we might offer guidance in the Divorce Act around this circumstance, this needs to be worded in a way that maintains the ability of the court to ultimately make the decision based on the best interest of the child, according to the information the court has at hand at the time.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202253">I am happy to have had the chance to speak to the bill as amended. I think a better version of it is now being discussed. Hopefully it will go forward to the committee where it may have a chance to improve it further and send it back to the House. At that time, we can make a further judgment on private member's Bill <Document DbId="2153838" Type="4">C-252</Document>. We can see whether it goes forward and allows a more appropriate way to address the circumstances of visitation rights of a critically or terminally ill person.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Szabo" id="1701209"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78477" Type="2">Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="202254">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on Bill <Document DbId="2153838" Type="4">C-252</Document>. </ParaText><ParaText id="202255">Hon. members have well covered the mechanics of what is involved here, but I have some points that I want to make. Whenever I hear of an issue on the floor of the House of Commons that has to do with families and children, I want to be part of it. One of the first bills that I had as a member was to provide income splitting between spouses so that one spouse could stay at home and care for preschool children.</ParaText><ParaText id="202256">I started to get involved in family and children issues and in fact, I have penned a number of small books on the subject. One of the books I wrote is called <I>Divorce--The Bold Facts</I>. It deals with a significant issue called parental alienation syndrome. This is one of the problems when there is a family breakdown and there is a custody issue and it is a nasty one or a confrontational split-up. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202257">One of the things I learned in doing research for that book was that children who witness abuse of their parents are as affected as if the children themselves had been abused. I also found that children who were used as pawns, as it were, in this parental alienation syndrome were also very much affected by the fact that one parent was pitting the children against another parent. </ParaText><ParaText id="202258">Through all the research and work that I have done, the truism for me is that both mothers and fathers have an important role to play in the lives of their children, even if the parents hate each other. That is important and that is the principle that this bill has raised.</ParaText><ParaText id="202259">Having said that, the bill itself, as we know, has now been amended. It was a one clause bill. That clause has been deleted and replaced by another clause. It basically addressed the substantive concerns that people had with regard to the bill and that was that it appeared to be putting a greater reliance on a principle that the spouse had a right that may have impinged on the whole concept of the best interests of the child.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202260">About 10 years ago a joint committee of the House of Commons and Senate issued an excellent report called “For the Sake of the Children”. I participated in some of the dialogue. One of the things that came out is that in these custody and access dispute issues the child was the only one in the proceedings that did not have a representative. The mother had a lawyer, the father had a lawyer, but who was taking care of the child? In fact, the child was being used as a pawn. Parental alienation syndrome was part of it. In fact, domestic violence was part of it. It was a number of these issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="202261">That report contained some excellent recommendations. I am sorry to say that the Divorce Act still has not been amended to take into account some of the important recommendations that were made by the special joint committee of the House of Commons and Senate in its report, “For the Sake of the Children”.</ParaText><ParaText id="202262">The items in the report deal very frontally with the kinds of things that the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78882" Type="2">Lethbridge</Affiliation> has raised in his bill.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202263">The bill in its original form was in some difficulty and likely would have not been successful at second reading. I understand that was the reason it was necessary to respond to the points that were raised during the first hour of debate some 30 sitting days ago.</ParaText><ParaText id="202264">Even with the current wording, and I think the member for <Affiliation DbId="78519" Type="2">Burnaby—Douglas</Affiliation> also has expressed some concern, there are a couple of things that do not quite work. We are at second reading debate on the bill where we debate the fundamental principles of the bill, the intent. We can deal at committee and at report stage with ensuring that the words are correct. I am not going to mince words that this bill does not technically work in the end result for me and so I am not going to support it; I will support it in principle and I will be recommending that my caucus support the bill in principle and that it be sent to the justice committee. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="00">(1800)</Timestamp><ParaText id="202265">I should also say that I share the concern that others have. The member for <Affiliation DbId="78559" Type="2">Hochelaga</Affiliation> indicated that the justice committee is totally bogged down. It is unfortunate, because it means that good legislation may have some difficulty getting through before there is another election after all the work that parliamentarians have done. It is a possibility. The Minister of Finance will concede it is a possibility, unless he comes up with a darned good budget. </ParaText><ParaText id="202266">The problem with minority governments is they have a quirkiness in that the legislative process by and large takes a substantial period of time. If a bill does not get introduced early enough in a minority Parliament, it will likely die on the order paper and that is a shame. Let me be specific for the members' purposes and for the committee that will look at it and I hope it will have a chance. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202267">The issue that they will be granted access appears to require to be defined, because in saying they shall be granted access, there are no dimensions. Could it be a day? Could it be a week? Who controls the timing of that? The mechanics of how it works is not in the existing legislation. This bill does not define it. We may have to deal with that in committee and I will urge the committee to make a definition about what it means and how it ties in consistently with the whole family of issues related to custody and access orders.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202268">The second item has to do with children. Children are persons 18 years of age and under. We have to ask ourselves whether or not the provisions of the Divorce Act amended by the bill would actually coerce a 12 to 17 year old to actually visit with a parent when a court may not order that and the child may not want to visit that parent. We have age of reason issues as well. There may be a conflict that has to be dealt with. What if a child of the age of reason does not want to visit that parent? This cannot be black and white. It is like most of our laws in that we have to deal with it on a case by case basis. There may have to be some proviso, for example, where possible, in accordance with orders or what are the rights of the child. </ParaText><ParaText id="202269">The importance of the bill is that it provides an opportunity to take the first step at making a critical appraisal of the condition of the current Divorce Act and the recommendation of the joint committee that did the report, “For the Sake of the Children”, to open up these issues to dialogue and discussion. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202270">I am supportive of the intent. I am a big fan of private members' business. I have had some success, but I can tell the member and all hon. members, in my view the best outcome of a private member's bill is to have the government adopt it as its own so that it can get fast tracked through the appropriate minister. There is nothing better.</ParaText><ParaText id="202271"> For instance, there was a private member's item which provided that if there was a situation of domestic abuse, the penalty related to that would be more than common assault because a trust relationship was being violated. In fact, in the Criminal Code today there are stiffer sentences for those who are convicted of spousal abuse. That happened not as a result of the ultimate discussion and debate and going through the whole private members' business process, but because the minister took it upon himself to do it.</ParaText><ParaText id="202272">The extension of maternity and paternal leave under EI from six months to a full year was the subject of a private member's bill. I do not even think it had second reading, but it appeared in the very next budget of the minister. The Minister of Finance is here. Maybe there are some opportunities here to do that.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="05">(1805)</Timestamp><ParaText id="202273">The bill is at second reading in principle and I believe the member was motivated with all the best intentions. I think he has the support of the House and I recommend that the House pass the bill at second reading.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="10">(1810)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Van Kesteren" id="1701264"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78511" Type="2">Mr. Dave Van Kesteren (Chatham-Kent—Essex, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="202274">Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to speak to this bill. I would like to congratulate the member for <Affiliation DbId="78882" Type="2"> Lethbridge</Affiliation> for this excellent amendment to the act and I commend him for this being his third private member's bill that involves children. We can see that children are very near and dear to his heart, as they are to mine. </ParaText><ParaText id="202275">I heard a previous member say that she has been married for 30 years. My wife and I have been married for 31 years and this year the last two of our eight children were married so we are very well acquainted with marriage. However, we also recognize that sometimes in life things do not go the way we planned and divorce is a sad reality.</ParaText><ParaText id="202276"> I am thankful and proud that the member for <Affiliation DbId="78882" Type="2"> Lethbridge</Affiliation> saw a flaw in the act and saw an opportunity to correct it. It is to this that I rise today to speak to this private member's bill, Bill <Document DbId="2153838" Type="4">C-252</Document>, an act to amend the Divorce Act which would allow access to the spouse, the divorced parent, who is terminally ill or in critical condition.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202277">We cannot imagine what that would be like. I was speaking to one of my colleagues just a minute ago and we were talking about past experiences. When my father passed away about 12 years ago I remember my whole family being around him and I remember that precious time we had together. I think my father also enjoyed having his children around him. It is hard to think that in this day and age that access could be denied. I believe that providing divorced parents who are terminally ill or in critical condition access to their child or children is important for several reasons.</ParaText><ParaText id="202278">First, we ensure that a spouse who is terminally ill or in critical condition has access to a child or children during his or her time of suffering. Let us think about how important it would be for a divorced parent, who is lying in a hospital bed or at home suffering, to have the presence of their child or children. </ParaText><ParaText id="202279">Second, we protect the child or children by considering access if it is in the best interests of the child or children of the marriage. The second part of this is the child. I am glad the member saw fit and, in his wisdom, took it upon himself to ensure that we always remember that it is in the best interests of the children as well.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202280">Third, we allow the child or children to be involved in the overall process of dealing with the impending loss of their parent and the grieving that follows. </ParaText><ParaText id="202281">Again, we had opportunity to speak as colleagues just a few minutes ago and one of my colleagues was telling us about how his wife, who is an adopted child, had the opportunity to see her adoptive mother on her deathbed but who does not have that opportunity with her birth mother. Of course this is a different matter and it is something that we may want to introduce in another bill, but it strikes home to the reality of closure. If we offer that closure to the child or the children, it is in the best interest of the child and it is a good thing.</ParaText><ParaText id="202282">After listening to all those who have spoken on this matter, I was pleased to hear that we all agree that this is a bill that must move forward. As parliamentarians, we should be considering ways to allow families to continue to function after a breakdown. Again, these are good things. These are things that the people who elect us to this great House expect us to do. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202283">This amendment should be supported because it demonstrates an understanding toward the strain on the spouses when a divorced parent is terminally ill or in critical condition and the responsibility to involve the child or children in the lives of their parents. Again, that bond that we share with our parents is something that is never broken. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="15">(1815)</Timestamp><ParaText id="202284">Here again we are moving in a direction which is going to ensure that those things continue on for future generations. If Parliament accepts this amendment to the Divorce Act, it will give parents who divorce the legally entrenched avenues necessary to have access to their child or children only if access does not run contrary to the best interests of the child or children involved. </ParaText><ParaText id="202285">Again, this is a good amendment, because we recognize that there are times when it is not in the best interests of children, but when it is, we want to be sure they have access. It will allow the court that considers giving access to the parent the right to determine by reference to the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the child or children that access is in their best interests. The courts would have the ability through the law to determine what is good and what is right.</ParaText><ParaText id="202286">For these reasons I support this amendment, because due consideration has been given to these issues faced by families in these circumstances. This amendment has a balanced approach, one which I support, as it provides parents who are terminally ill or in critical condition access to their children, while also ensuring that such access is granted by the court according to the best interests of the child or children involved. That sums it up.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202287">We all agree that we need to put through this bill, to go through due process, and we all agree that this bill should be enacted quickly. I am thankful for the opportunity to speak to this private member's bill.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Hopefully that hard work will continue, and I hope they are listening tonight. I must express my thanks to the Library of Parliament for its work in the legal research and writing. </ParaText><ParaText id="202294">The spirit of this amendment is to deal with the children and the right of a child to be able to have one last visit. It is for the children. All other things aside, that was the scope of what I was trying to get at here. It is consistent with a couple of other private members' bills. It is interesting that the member for <Affiliation DbId="78477" Type="2">Mississauga South</Affiliation> said that the best way to get a bill forward is to get the government to pick it up and put it into law. I agree with that. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202295">That actually happened with one of the first private members' bills I brought through. It dealt with the Criminal Code. I brought forward an amendment so that courts could seize materials used to produce child pornography upon a conviction. It was not in the code. The bill did not actually pass the House, but it is law now. It was picked up by the government of the time and put into law, so I feel pretty good about that.</ParaText><ParaText id="202296">Then, of course, there is the issue of raising the age of sexual consent from 14 to 16. That was another bill I worked on, with the member for <Affiliation DbId="78732" Type="2">Calgary Northeast</Affiliation>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78373" Type="2">Wild Rose</Affiliation> and others, and that too now is in a bill that has been presented in the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="202297"> Hopefully with this intervention tonight it looks like this is going to be supported and we can move it on to committee, but before I do that, earlier today we amended the bill, so I would like to make one more request of the House today.</ParaText><ParaText id="202298"> In light of the fact that Bill <Document DbId="2153838" Type="4">C-252</Document> was amended earlier today by unanimous consent of the House, it would be useful for the record if the bill could be reprinted with the new text.

I think all Canadians, once given the evidence, will also agree that there needs to be something done. Specifically, what we have before us is hypocrisy, which would be the more cynical term, but at the very least a contradiction of ideas.</ParaText><ParaText id="202314">Year in and year out we see governments providing a tax subsidy to an economic sector that is experiencing its greatest boom perhaps of all time. This is the oil and gas sector of northern Alberta, in particular the tar sands and the development around Fort McMurray. This started with the previous Liberal government, but the Conservative government has chosen to keep it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202315">There was a moment in last year's budget when there was a huge surplus. We knew there was some $13 billion extra sitting in the kitty. The government followed this surplus up by cutting another $1 billion of vital programs to Canadians, programs that people have wanted and used for years, programs to museums, programs to help adults learn to read and write and programs to help women finally achieve some status of equality, both in pay and in quality of life conditions. The government chose to cut programs because I guess it did not see them as a priority, or it did not feel they were important. </ParaText><ParaText id="202316">It also chose to cut the EnerGuide program, a program that had received credit for having thousands upon thousands of homes achieve better environmental conditions. All the while these cuts were going on, the government still found enough room in the budget to syphon off $1.5 billion to the oil and gas sector.</ParaText><ParaText id="202317">When I asked this question some weeks ago, the minister stood up and gave another ministerial response about how important it was to use taxpayer money wisely.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202318">I know the parliamentary secretary will be answering my question. Hopefully he will make an announcement that this ludicrous subsidy is ended. It makes no more sense. There is no incentive needed for companies to go into the oil sector. They are there already. They have massive plans to do more. Yet the government seems committed to shuffling them off some corporate welfare while at the same time not supporting things that we know are important for Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="202319">This is unbalanced because the government has also made its commitment that it will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In particular, the government has agreed, in full, to the recommendations provided by the Auditor General's office under the Commissioner of the Environment. In those recommendations is the need to attack and aggressively go after the emissions in the tar sands because they will double in the next number of years. It is hypocrisy to suggest it will reduce the pollution while at the same time it subsidizes that pollution.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202320">This is the parliamentary secretary's opportunity to come clean on the issue, to allow his government's plans to stand to the light of day and to suggest that this subsidy is simply no longer required. The industry is one of the healthiest industries in the entire country. To continue to push them down toward unsustainable development is unwise. Even the soon to be retiring Premier of Alberta has recognized that this is unwise. It is time for the government to stand up and agree with that statement, pull the subsidy back and put it into the energy projects that we actually need, the ones for which Canadians are looking.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

This government decided that we were going to pay down the debt because that was the promise we made. It was a good decision. It does not make everybody happy, but it was the right thing to do. We are going to be saving $650 million a year in interest that we would have had to pay, which saves a lot of money for hard-working Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="202323">Regarding the oil sands, our government recognizes that the oil sands are important to Canadians and the Canadian economy. This government also recognizes that any development in that area must take into consideration the environmental impacts. Our government is committed to providing real practical long term solutions to cleaning up our air and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202324">This week we will be introducing the clean air act. It will cover all industrial sectors, including the oil industry. These efforts will directly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases. A national long term regulatory strategy will give industry, the provinces, and the Canadian people, certainty and confidence. </ParaText><ParaText id="202325">It will also provide flexibility and the opportunity to achieve real improvements to air quality, improve the health of Canadians, and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that cause climate change. Our government is working with the provinces and territories, the oil industry, first nations, environmental groups and other interested parties on this issue. Together we will find ways of reducing emissions.</ParaText><ParaText id="202326">Currently, this government is working with the Government of Alberta during its public consultation examining the environmental, economic, and social impacts of the oil sands to develop a vision and principles for oil sands development. </ParaText><ParaText id="202327">In addition, this government continues to be actively involved in the review of the environmental impact assessments for the oil sands development and the regional initiative dealing with the cumulative environmental assessments.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

That will not be the case.</ParaText><ParaText id="202330">If this sector is doubling, why would the government continue to make a priority of subsidizing the sector to the tune of $1.5 billion? If set aside and put into green energy projects, this would actually work for Canadians and work for our international commitments. We can still meet those commitments if the government resets its priorities. </ParaText><ParaText id="202331">We look forward to the clean air act, but when action was called for, the government decided to introduce a bill that is going to take four or five years to implement with consultation.

							<ParaText id="202339">Today, October 17, one month later, I am again asking the government whether it is prepared to go ahead and implement the program proposed by the Bloc Québécois. It is a program that would help communities diversify their economy, help the industry with concrete measures to regain the productivity it needs to compete, and help workers, especially older workers.</ParaText><ParaText id="202340">Today, we were treated to an alarming display by the Conservative government. We are asking the government to put in place a program for older workers who can no longer find jobs, and again today, the government is responding with a retraining program. </ParaText><ParaText id="202341">I do not know what it will take for the government to understand that when workers reach 56, 57, 58, they do everything they can to find another job. Unfortunately, though, because they do not have the necessary training—often because employers will not hire them, mainly because of their age—if they do not receive help, they slowly sink into misery and poverty and are forced to sell their assets and homes.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202342">I think that people who have worked 25 or 30 years for a company, who have supported a family, deserve to have their government—which accumulated a $13 billion surplus last year—implement a program that would cost no more than $75 million a year to help workers, not only those in the forestry sector but in all industrial sectors as well. </ParaText><ParaText id="202343">That was the motion Parliament adopted yesterday. The three opposition parties, which form the majority in Parliament, told the minority government that Canada needs such a program. </ParaText><ParaText id="202344">Today, will the government tell us whether or not it intends to follow through with this program, with the Bloc Québécois' plan to help forestry workers in particular, but also industry and communities? There is a crisis in the forest industry and something must be done about it. The federal government has an important responsibility here, given how it negotiated the softwood lumber agreement with the American government. </ParaText><ParaText id="202345">More is needed.

Make no mistake, the Government of Canada recognizes the importance of the forest products industry to the Canadian economy. Let me assure the member that Canada's new government is keenly aware and is sensitive to the challenges facing this industry. </ParaText><ParaText id="202347">From the outset, our government has been committed to the best interests of Canada, our provinces, the industry, forest workers and communities that depend on the forest sector. Resolution of the softwood lumber dispute is just one way the federal government has demonstrated its commitment to workers and the industry. </ParaText><ParaText id="202348">The softwood lumber agreement gives our producers stable and predictable access to the United States market. It ends years of costly litigation and repays over $5 billion Canadian in duty deposits to Canadian producers, a significant infusion of capital for the industry that will benefit workers and communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="202349">I must admit that I am rather puzzled by the hon. member's question. It was originally asked on September 19, the day after the <Affiliation DbId="78741" Type="4">Minister of International Trade</Affiliation> tabled a ways and means motion to implement the agreement in this House on September 18.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202350">The motion passed its first vote in the House of Commons with the support of the hon. member's party. The agreement has been in force since October 12. Canada's new government delivered a deal supported by two nations, all the lumber producing provinces and a clear majority of the lumber companies. This deal clearly shows that the government, which puts Canadians ahead of partisan politics, will always deliver what is in the best interests of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="202351">We all waited for the hon. member's party to figure out its position on the softwood lumber agreement. It consulted, strategized, mused and finally concluded what our government already knew: Quebeckers were in favour of the agreement. Lumber producers in Quebec supported the deal. Communities and workers whose livelihoods depended on the critical sector welcomed the agreement as an important step toward protecting jobs and promoting prosperity. All of Canada's key lumber producing provinces, including Quebec, have endorsed it.</ParaText><ParaText id="202352">Canadians asked this government to come up with a resolution that provided stability for the industry and protected the livelihoods of workers, communities and families, not only in Quebec but across the country. We have done that. We have delivered.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="202353">The resolution of the softwood lumber dispute is not the only way that this government has demonstrated its commitment to the forestry industry. As the hon. member will recall, we announced in budget 2006 a $400 million investment to encourage the long term competitiveness of the forest industry, to address the pine beetle infestation in western Canada, and to assist worker adjustment. </ParaText><ParaText id="202354">Just today, Canada's new government announced a program to address the needs of older workers who have lost their jobs in communities where the local economy is experiencing ongoing unemployment or industries affected by downsizing and closures, industries like forestry.</ParaText><ParaText id="202355">Let me conclude by stating that the end of the softwood lumber dispute has been a key priority and an accomplishment for our government. We can finally turn the page and direct our full attention to building a stronger and more competitive Canada.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
