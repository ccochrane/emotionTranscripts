The wording of the motion might make it seem like it is a trivial or technical thing, and it might even be seen as a little unconventional to make such a matter the subject of what we call an opposition day or a supply motion, but I and many others in the House believe this issue to be a fundamentally very important one because it has to do with my ability and the ability of all colleagues in the House to get up right now, to get up at any point in time, to do our jobs as members of Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139131">It goes right to the core of what this place does as a place of debate, what members of Parliament do as they carry on their work of debating on public issues in the House, at committee, and actually in the constituency, out in the street.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139132">Since parliaments began, the world has changed over that huge period of time. We now have another world of media: communications, television and text messaging all going on. The world is, of course, much bigger than what is here in our House.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139133">There was a time not that long ago when just above us, just above where you are, Mr. Speaker, the media used to sit. We called them the press. Their benches are still there and their job was to report to Canadians on what we did in this House.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139134">A lot has changed. The press actually do not sit there very much anymore because they can watch what we do on television. They make use of the communication facilities of the House. Indeed, by special arrangement and by special constitutional arrangements, what they do is quite special to us in the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139135">We even let the media control a piece of our parliamentary precinct. The Canadian media control the press theatre downstairs. It is under their control and not the control of the political parties or the Speaker or the House, and there is a written agreement to that effect.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139136">The point I am making here is that in the world of communications and what we do as members of Parliament, it is more than just what we say in the House. What we use to just do in the House has now moved out into the scrum area and out into the electronic universe.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139137">Just for the record, I feel, and most members will feel, that we have to read some statement of the principle we rely on here, and I am going to read one. It is from the 1977 first report of the special committee on the rights and immunities of members of Parliament:</ParaText><ParaText id="1139138"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Freedom of Speech</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1139139"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> By far, the most important right accorded to Members of the House is the exercise of freedom of speech in parliamentary proceedings. It has been described as...a fundamental right without which they [Members of Parliament] would be hampered in the performance of their duties. It permits them to speak in the House without inhibition, to refer to any matter or express any opinion as they see fit, to say what they feel needs to be said in the furtherance of the national interest and the aspirations of their constituents.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1139140">That refers to what is said in the House and by extension in committees. It does not necessarily, and technically perhaps, govern what is said outside the House and committees. What we are dealing with today is what is said or not said in the House and at committees. </ParaText><ParaText id="1139141">The motion that is before us here today does not deal with communications outside the House and committees. The rules governing those communications are still out there. What we are talking about is the freedom of a member to speak freely and vote in the House of Commons.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1139142">The sequence of these events started about 20 or 25 years ago. Some lobbying went on, which has been generally spoken to and described in two separate files. One file is the airbus file and the other file is the Thyssen or Bear Head file, which are separate files but in some ways linked. </ParaText><ParaText id="1139143">With a lot of lobbying going on 20 years or so ago, some money was moved around. The question that has come up now is whether the rules we had then were appropriate to guide public officers in either receiving, not receiving or managing those types of issues involving lobbyists. </ParaText><ParaText id="1139144">The Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics embarked on a study and did not do too bad a job. It reported to the House. It is not that all issues have been cleared up but a number of public issues were raised in that whole sequence.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139145">In the context of that, one of the members of that committee said something outside the House, to which a witness at that committee study, a former prime minister, took objection and commenced a lawsuit. That was a slander action and it is still out there. It was not directly connected to what we do in the House at all, at least we did not think it was.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139146">I have another set of facts that are on a collision course now. Those facts include the decision of the House to adopt rules of conduct and a Conflict of Interest Code, which was a good step forward. The code is in place and we now have an Ethics Commissioner who assists us in the interpretation and enforcement of that code. It has worked quite well so far but my recollection is that when the code was put in place it moved fairly quickly. It involved a complex set of issues. </ParaText><ParaText id="1139147">Most members are quite happy and proud that we now have an Ethics Commissioner and a code. However, these two facts now collide when they are taken up by the Ethics Commissioner in dealing with a complaint about the member who made the alleged slanderous remarks. She, quite professionally, looked at the code and tried to figure out whether the member has some duty or obligation in the House as a result of what happened outside the House. </ParaText><ParaText id="1139148">Inside the House, the commissioner points out that section 3 of our Conflict of Interest Code has a provision that says that members may not further their private interests inside the House but that outside the House they can do whatever they want. However, as members of Parliament, we are bound not to further our private interests in what we do in this place and at committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139149">In defining a private interest, the Ethics Commissioner looked at subsection (3)(2)(b) of the Conflict of Interest Code which states that a private interest would include “the extinguishment, or reduction in the amount, of the person’s liabilities”. That is all well enough.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139150">We have the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation>, who is being sued outside the House. Does he have a private interest? The Ethics Commissioner decided that, on the face of it, it was not clear that a lawsuit outside the House was a liability so she decided that she would include in the definition of liability the term “contingent liability”. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1139151">The Ethics Commissioner included the words “contingent liability” in our set of definitions because those words are included in <I>Black's Law Dictionary</I>, not because we put it in our code, and that therefore the contingent liability she would focus on is potential liability, not contingent liability, in my view, that might be there in this lawsuit.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139152">Therefore, because the member is subject to a lawsuit that might produce a judgment, which, in the view of the commissioner, could constitute a contingent liability, it would then fall within the rule that says that we should not further a private interest. She believes the member could further his private interest, this contingent liability, this potential liability in the lawsuit, by something he might do or not do in voting or speaking in the House. That takes us right to the core of the principle here today. It was her view that this set of circumstances must, by our rule, abridge the member's right to free speech in the House and at committee, not only the right to speak but the right to vote.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139153">We have this interpretation that comes in through the back door. It certainly was an unintended result. I cannot recall anyone around here envisaging this back door route in interpretation to secure the logic that brought us to the point that would abridge, curtail, prevent the member from voting or speaking on this particular set of issues in the House of Commons or at committee. As I have said previously, that is intolerable.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139154">The member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> is, under our Constitution, completely free and unfettered to say whatever he wants outside the House in the media, in the scrum, in his riding, in his house, in his town council and everywhere else out there. However, inside the House, according to our Ethics Commissioner, he cannot speak freely.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139155">This House is the one place in the whole country that is supposed to have, by constitutional root going back hundreds of years, the total, unabridged right of free speech for members but somehow we have ended up in a situation where the member has had that right taken away. If he follows the guidance and decision of the Ethics Commissioner, he has broken the rule and, therefore, may not speak and may not vote on those issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139156">I submit that was a totally unintended result caused by what I call this back door, circuitous interpretation of the rules. I am not saying that the Ethics Commissioner made a huge mistake. She made a fairly mechanical interpretation of the rules. It was a little bit like a law school exercise. a syllogism made two plus two equals four, and she reached the conclusion, but did she miss the big one. She missed the fundamental constitutional right of free speech for everyone who serves in this place. </ParaText><ParaText id="1139157">By coincidence, when we adopted the Parliament of Canada Act quite a few years ago, like 140 years ago, section 5 says that the privileges we have in this place are so fundamental that outside in the real world no one has to plead them to the court because all the courts in the country are, by statute, obligated to take notice in courts judicial notice of these privileges. They are very fundamental but most of the time we take them for granted which maybe we should not. </ParaText><Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1139158"> However, in this case the Ethics Commissioner somehow missed it. Maybe we should have listed our privileges a little more clearly in the Code of Conduct but we took it for granted and did not bother, so she did not interpret it. She read in <I>Black's Law Dictionary</I> the definition of “contingent liability” but she did not read our fundamental rights and privileges in this place. She never got there. In a sense I am saying that she should have but I must forgive her because when we wrote the rules we wrote them in a certain way that took a lot of things for granted. In fact, we may have written the rules a little too quickly but we wrote them and it was for a good purpose.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139159">Where do we go from here? We need to assist the Ethics Commissioner to clarify the ruling and to fix our rules. It has created what people call a kind of libel chill. </ParaText><ParaText id="1139160">I asked a week or two ago what would happen if someone decided to sue every member in the New Democratic Party or the Bloc Québécois caucuses for something allegedly mean and nasty they were doing or had said. Would that prevent every member of the caucus having a contingent liability under these rules and this interpretation from speaking or voting on something in the House? According to the Ethics Commissioner, it would if we take the literal interpretation of her ruling. There is no other conclusion one can draw.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139161">We need to clarify the rule. As I do that, I need to address the context in the House. We are working in a minority Parliament and most of us will agree that the debate and the exchanges in the House have been rather testy, excessively partisan and maybe less than the standard we would want to use back in our ridings. In fact, most of us get along pretty well with other MPs back in our ridings. In the House, however, it is not working too well. I am urging members, in dealing with this motion, to try to put the partisanship aside. </ParaText><ParaText id="1139162">One has to accept that it would be natural for a political party with a political stance, in dealing with something coming from another party in debate, to want to use whatever rule or device it could to repress, knock off, set aside or defend against whatever is being alleged and said. That happens in debate. </ParaText><ParaText id="1139163">It is possible that some members may say that the ethics rule is good because it prevents those guys from saying those things. Many may say that we should let the Ethics Commissioner's ruling be the device to prevent that person or those people from saying those things because we do not like what they say. I urge members on both sides to take a step back and look at the broader picture.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139164">I know we have all heard the adage “I don't like what that person is saying but I will defend unto death the person's right to say it”. That adage has been around so long I do not even know who originally said it. I am not offering death at this point. I am offering nothing more than our fundamental right in this place, which is that we have the right to say it in this place, though not necessarily out there. </ParaText><ParaText id="1139165">The lawsuits can go fast and furious out there but in this place and in committees there is an absolute unfettered right to say it. I am urging members on both sides of the House to consider this objectively and to affirm the fundamental right we have to debate, speak and uphold the constitutional traditions and conventions that we have always had and which have now been, arguably, impaired by this ruling. We need to fix the rules and get the member for West Nova back on his feet on all issues.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I agree with one thing he said, or perhaps even more than one thing, but the one thing I agree with right off the top is that this debate is extremely interesting and it should be held in a very reasonable and non-partisan manner, because I think it is extremely important.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139167">What the motion intends to do is fundamentally change some of the rules that have guided all of us for a number of years. We are guided by a great many rules, if I can call them that, or conventions, as the member says, from procedures and practices to Standing Orders to codes of conduct, and I think before we make any changes we ought to very carefully examine the consequences of those changes.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139168">The member speaks of what he considers to be the overriding principle of members of Parliament, that is, the right to speak freely in this place. While I appreciate that, I would suggest that there is one even more overriding or overarching principle that we are all guided by and that is to put the public interest ahead of our own interest.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139169">I would give the member a suggestion and ask him whether or not he agrees with it. If there is a legitimate lawsuit brought forward by a member of the public against a sitting member of Parliament and that member of Parliament is allowed to speak to that issue at a committee level, in effect that member of Parliament would have an advantage over the member of the general public who brought the lawsuit.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139170"> In effect, the member of Parliament would be conducting an examination for discovery or, in other words, putting his own private interest in that case over that of the general public. That is why we have a commissioner to interpret cases on a case by case basis. If there were a lawsuit that had no effect as to the subject material in the committee, then the member would not be encumbered.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139171"> I would simply ask the member this.

It trumps the lawsuit out on civvy street. If we are going to buy the principle, we buy the whole thing.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139173"> If there is a lawsuit between two people, that is fine. They can have their own pissing match. They can, but what governs is the public interest, and the public interest is reflected by the views of every member of this House in here and at committee. That trumps everything that goes on out on civvy street.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139174">Second, the member asked whether the member of Parliament would have an advantage. I say no, because we all know that the courts out there operate based on only the evidence adduced in the trial at the hearing. Let me repeat: only the evidence adduced in the trial at the hearing.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139175">However, everything that happens in this House and at committee is privileged and bound by parliamentary privilege. It is not usable. It cannot be used or transported outside this place. If somebody attempted to use evidence adduced in a committee or in the House it would be a breach of parliamentary privilege. It would be a contempt.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139176">So the answer to that on both fronts is yes, the public interest trumps everything, and that is why what happens here is more important than what happens in the trial. Second, the evidence from here is not usable out there, so there is no advantage.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

That is what we have to make sure we have the right to do here in speech, and sometimes it is a bit like standing in front of a tank, but we must have that ability to stand here representing our electors and say what has to be said even if it irritates all other 307 members of the House.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

There is a distinction there.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139186"> We all of course remember a few years ago Chuck Cadman casting a deciding vote on whether or not a government would fall.

It would amend the conflict of interest code for members of the House of Commons. It would refer the report of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner concerning the member for<Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation>back to the commissioner for reconsideration. The motion would affirm the confidence of the House in the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139193">My concern with respect to the motion is the amendment of the conflict of interest code. I really do object to the process which the member has chosen to take place in the House with respect to his attempt to change the conflict of interest code. I am concerned that members will not have had adequate time to consider whether the proposed change is necessary and whether it has been properly drafted.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139194">The conflict of interest code has been the subject of careful review by parliamentarians dating back over 35 years when the Trudeau government tabled a green paper on this subject in 1973. Since then, parliamentarians have studied numerous initiatives to develop a code of conduct. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139195">For example, in 1978 the Trudeau government introduced the independence of Parliament act. In 1988 the Mulroney government introduced the members of the Senate and House of Commons conflict of interest act. In 1993 the Mulroney government introduced the conflict of interest and public office-holders act. </ParaText><ParaText id="1139196">In 1995 a special joint committee chaired by the current Speaker and by Senator Oliver was established to develop a code of conduct.

The committee tabled a report with a code which reflected the comments of the members of the committee as well as input from members of the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139199">In its report, the procedure and House affairs committee stated:</ParaText><ParaText id="1139200"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The result of our consultations and intensive study is, we believe, a document in which all Members of the House can have confidence.

							<ParaText id="1139202">The reason that I have gone through this brief history lesson is to remind members that the drafting of the code involved careful consideration and consultation by members over a great number of years. Its provisions should not be taken lightly. The code needs to be effective to ensure Canadians have the highest level of confidence in Parliament and its members. At the same time, care must be taken to ensure that the code does not unduly restrict the privileges of members of the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139203">Given the importance of the code, it is not surprising that extensive deliberations took place by parliamentarians before the code was finalized. It therefore follows that changes to the code should not be done in haste without any proper consideration or consultations.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139204"> Even minor changes can have unforeseen consequences. Given the implications the code may have for members of Parliament, any changes should be carefully considered before it is adopted by the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139205">Instead, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation> is proposing that a change be made to the code after only a few hours of debate in the House. In my view, it would be more appropriate for the procedure and House affairs committee to hear from experts on this issue, including the Ethics Commissioner herself.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1139206">One of the issues that I think should be explored by the procedure committee is whether the proposed change achieves the member's objectives. For example, the proposed amendment refers to “actions of the member as a member of Parliament”. This begs the question, what are the actions of a member as a member of Parliament? </ParaText><ParaText id="1139207">I do not believe that the member for <Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation> intends to refer to proceedings in Parliament, as parliamentary privilege adequately protects members of Parliament in this regard. For example, a member cannot be subject to a lawsuit for his or her statements in the House or in committee. He said that. I must therefore conclude that the member for Scarborough—Rouge River is referring to actions by members of Parliament outside the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139208">What actions outside the House constitute actions as a member of Parliament? How do we distinguish between the actions of a member of Parliament as a private citizen versus actions as a member of Parliament? What statements that members of Parliament make to the media constitute actions as a member of Parliament?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139209">In this regard, it is not clear whether this amendment would actually achieve the objectives the member for <Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation> is seeking. In the case of the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation>, the lawsuit that he faces is a result of statements that he made to the media outside the House. It is not clear to me that the member for West Nova was acting as a member of Parliament in making those statements to the media as any activity outside the House is not a parliamentary proceedings. There is a distinguishing factor.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139210">In fact, very little of the functions of a member of Parliament outside the House or committee can be considered a parliamentary function. For example, in the second edition of <I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I>, Joseph Maingot states at page 84:</ParaText><ParaText id="1139211"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">A clear distinction should be drawn between those things a Member does in the exercise of his capacity as a Member, only one of which is to take part in a “proceeding in Parliament,” and those he does because he is a Member: the latter are much wider and are not necessarily protected.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1139212">He further states at page 102:</ParaText><ParaText id="1139213"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The uttering of slanderous words by a Member of Parliament to a journalist outside the floor of the House is not protected by absolute privilege. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139214">It will be ultimately up to the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner to interpret the proposed change. We cannot predict how she would apply this provision. On the other hand, the procedure committee would have to have been able to ask the commissioner's view on this change and receive her advice of what changes, if any, should be made to the code.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139215">Instead, members are being asked to make a change to the code today without the benefit of such consultation. I would also note that the member for <Affiliation DbId="78531" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> put forward at the ethics committee different wording to change the Conflict of Interest Code.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139216">In his motion at the ethics committee he made reference to excluding, as a private interest under the code, being named as a defendant in a lawsuit regarding a matter then before Parliament or a committee of Parliament. That was, at least, a lot more precise than the motion before the House today.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139217">The motion before us would exclude where a member is a party to a legal action. This could include a situation where a member has commenced the lawsuit as a plaintiff, and plaintiffs of course are parties to a lawsuit. Therefore, this would allow a member to commence an action in the courts and then be allowed to participate in parliamentary proceedings dealing with the subject of the suit and be allowed to participate in those proceedings and use them to advance the member's court case, and even intimidate the party the member was suing.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139218">This shows the need for this matter to be studied much more closely by us as parliamentarians and not dealt with as a result of a hasty, short, one day debate. This also demonstrates there are alternative ways to accept to change the code, if that is necessary, and it would be appropriate to have the procedure committee examine these issues more carefully.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="55">(1055)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1139219">Members may respond by arguing that the procedure committee is not currently meeting and that therefore, today's opposition motion is the only way for the House to respond to the ethics committee's report. However, the procedure and House affairs committee is not meeting because of the tyranny of the majority of that committee which overturned a sound reading by the chair and ultimately removed the chair from his position. This is an example of the situation that the Speaker referred to on March 14 when he stated, “committees have found themselves in situations that verge on anarchy”.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139220">I agree that we need to find a solution to the impasse at the procedure and House affairs committee and I believe that the solution is simple. When the chairs of the committee make a sound procedural ruling that is supported by the clerk of the committee, the committee has to uphold and respect that ruling. All members of Parliament should follow the rules and respect the Standing Orders.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139221">If members think that the ethics committee's report is of urgent importance, then they should agree to work constructively in committee and respect the rules of Parliament. In that way the procedure committee can review the Ethics Commissioner's report and recommend any action it deems necessary.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139222">This is not the first time the opposition has tried to circumvent our normal procedures to implement a change that has not been properly thought out to the Conflict of Interest Code. For example, opposition members on the access to information, privacy and ethics committee tried to ignore the Standing Orders by tabling a report recommending a change to the code. The Speaker rightly ruled the report was out of order as it was clearly beyond the mandate of that committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139223">The member for <Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation> has also raised a question of privilege on this issue but has chosen to move forward with his motion without waiting for a ruling by the Speaker. The Speaker noted on May 15, “In my view, there are other mechanisms available to debate and resolve the matter at hand”. In this respect, I would remind all members that section 28(10) of the code allows a member to move a motion to concur in the report. I note that the member for <Affiliation DbId="78531" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> already has a motion on the order paper pursuant to this section. Presumably then, the House could amend the motion to express its opinion on the Ethics Commissioner's report.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139224">In addition, section 28(13) of the code makes provision for the House to refer the ethics committee's report back to the commissioner for further consideration with instructions. Since the Conflict of Interest Act already contains provisions that allow the House to respond to the commissioner's report, I believe it is misguided to change the Conflict of Interest Code at this time.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139225">I would also note that it is not an urgent need to make quick changes to the code. In her report, the commissioner states:</ParaText><ParaText id="1139226"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Concerns have been raised about the use of lawsuits, more particularly libel suits, to prevent a Member from performing his or her duties in the House of Commons. I cannot predict whether this may indeed become a problem and I hope it does not.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1139227">By stating she cannot predict whether this may become a problem in the future, the commissioner is implying that the use of lawsuits is currently not a problem or a significant barrier to the ability of members to perform their duties in the House.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139228">I would also note that members of Parliament have legal remedies to respond to lawsuits. If a member feels that a lawsuit is frivolous or vexatious, they can ask the court to dismiss the case. The court has a wide range of remedies it can apply, including, most important, dismissal of the case, plus possible damage costs awarded, which would result even in disciplinary action against any lawyer who is acting for a party commencing in such a frivolous or vexatious lawsuit against a member, especially if it was motivated to interfere with a member of Parliament's duties and privileges.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139229">However, the court is the best place to make that determination. If the court finds that a lawsuit is valid, members should not be able to use their parliamentary privilege to advance their legal position. There is therefore no compelling need to make immediate changes to the code. Instead, it would be worthwhile to have the procedure committee examine the issue to determine whether there is a problem that needs to be fixed, and if so, how to remedy the situation.</ParaText>

As members know, the work of this committee has been stalled. As there is no chair, the committee cannot meet. That is not the purpose of my speech, but if I have enough time at the end, I will be able to correct the nonsense being spouted by the Conservative member.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139271">The motion moved today by the Liberal Party deals with something that is at the heart of our work as parliamentarians. We are talking about parliamentary privilege. Parliamentary privilege derives from British parliamentary law, which serves as our reference, since this Parliament was inspired by Britain's, as was the Parliament of each province, including the Quebec National Assembly.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139272">Over the centuries, parliamentary privilege has had to be protected repeatedly from attacks by courts, by members and by various lobby groups that did not agree that members should enjoy parliamentary privilege. Parliamentary privilege is vital, however, because if we as members have no parliamentary privilege, we could find ourselves at the mercy of any sort of interference. We could be deprived of our right to speak, our freedom of speech and our freedom to move within the parliamentary precinct without threat or aggression.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139273">I have had occasion in the past to invoke my parliamentary privilege. A few years ago, I was the Bloc Québécois transport critic when we were looking at the merger between Air Canada and Canadian Airlines. At the end of the transport committee hearings, I had slightly rattled one witness, Mr. Schwartz, who wanted to proceed with the merger of Air Canada and Canadian Airlines, which could have meant moving Air Canada's headquarters, which is in Montreal—which suited the Bloc Québécois. Fortunately, as things turned out, Canadian Airlines was absorbed into Air Canada and not the reverse. We had had a fairly forceful, but polite exchange.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139274">Mr. Speaker, you know my style. I am a model of patience and civility in this House. If everyone were as even-tempered as I am, things would probably go much better. </ParaText><ParaText id="1139275">When the hearings ended, a lobbyist for Canadian Airlines started berating me. He began challenging the way I had questioned Gerald Schwartz, who had a stake in Canadian Airlines. I have to say that that lobbyist for Canadian Airlines found out what parliamentary privilege was all about. I went to see the committee chair and the sergeant-at-arms, who was then Mr. Cloutier. The lobbyist was denied access to the parliamentary precinct, the Centre Block, where the committee met. He was prevented from attending any more meetings, because he had acted to constrain a parliamentarian.</ParaText>

He expressed himself, but by all accounts, some people did not like what he said. Allow me to put this into context: he made comments on Mike Duffy's program, probably here in the foyer of the House.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139278">Nevertheless, the purpose of the action taken by the Conservative member who spoke earlier was obviously to deny the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> his parliamentary privilege. We cannot accept that no matter who it comes from or which side of the table it comes from. I am not a fan of the hon. member for West Nova or of any member of the Liberal Party, but I am a democrat and I respect these hon. members because they were democratically elected.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139279">I ask them to accept me as well for the same reason.

To ignore that would be to change the facts and try to hide things. Nonetheless, with all due respect to the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner, Ms. Dawson, that was a bad decision. She made a mistake, hence this opposition day and this motion that we will pass this evening, if the three opposition parties stick together.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139282">I would like to take this opportunity to talk about the tyranny of the majority the hon. member mentioned.

							<ParaText id="1139284">With all due respect, although we are halfway through 2008, the Conservative Party still has not understood this. In reality, the Conservatives cannot do whatever they please, since the opposition has the majority.

In fact, he traced its history back to 1689 and the original Bill of Rights in the UK, which forms a part of our Canadian Constitution.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139323">The second item in this comprehensive opposition day motion states:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139324"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">that, in order to clarify and assure those privileges, Section 3(3) of the Conflict of Interest Code for Members of the House of Commons, which is Appendix I to the Standing Orders of the House of Commons, is amended by deleting the word “or” at the end of paragraph <I>(b)</I> and by adding the following after paragraph <I>(b):</I></QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1139325">I will paraphrase the paragraph. It should be made abundantly clear in the Standing Orders, that govern the conduct of members of Parliament, that members are not in a conflict of interest just because they are engaged in a lawsuit or a lawsuit has been filed against them. That in and of itself does not automatically put members in a position of conflict. That is the important amendment that we have to contemplate here today.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139326"> I will deal with these points one at a time after I have introduced them. </ParaText><ParaText id="1139327">The paragraph goes on to say that the House should refer the Thibault inquiry report back to the Ethics Commissioner for reconsideration in light of the recommended change to the conflict of interest guidelines in the previous paragraph.</ParaText>

Should this become a serious concern for Members, however, the Code could be adjusted to except libel suits from the ambit of “private interest” for the purposes of sections 8 and 13.

Big pharma could file a statement of claim saying that I said something libellous and under these rules I would not be able to talk about big pharma again until that lawsuit was settled. That would put me at a terrible disadvantage. If big pharma was called to the health committee to talk about the drug patent laws, I would not be able to ask questions about it, even though it is a very particular interest of mine. Big pharma would have effectively silenced one of its annoying critics by simply filing that lawsuit. Even if it knew full well that it would lose the lawsuit two years later, it would have shut me up.

In fact if we farmed it off to a small minor subcommittee of Parliament, like procedure and House affairs, it would not be in the full context of all of Parliament debating these rules. It would be that narrow representation on a dysfunctional committee that has not sat for months.

He is being sued for a lot of money”. Again, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> was not aware of this yet. Somehow Brian Mulroney told the member for <Affiliation DbId="78631" Type="2">Dufferin—Caledon</Affiliation> before he told the member for West Nova.

							<ParaText id="1139355">There is a time honoured tradition among activists. I consider myself an activist. As a trade union leader, I have been on a lot of picket lines and I have demonstrated on a lot of issues. There is a time honoured tradition in the corporate world called the SLAPP suit. If somebody is annoying someone else, let us say if Greenpeace is annoying Exxon, one way to slow down one's critics is to file a slap suit. Usually the big corporate entity has a lot better ability to withstand a prolonged legal battle than does the small citizens activist group.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139356">The SLAPP suit has been an effective means ever since the ban the bomb movement in the late 1950s and the 1960s. If we are being too effective and we are starting to press a nerve in the corporate world, we might get our butts sued even though we know full well we are in the right and the corporate world is in the wrong. The corporate world can drag it out for year after year in the courts, and will exhaust our resources. It will effectively silence us, or it will at least handicap and hobble us.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139357">That is what is happening here today. This is the most litigious government probably in the history of Canada. I have never heard of so many lawsuits in the course of one minority Parliament.

I have noticed that the leader of the official opposition does not ask questions directly on the Cadman issue any more, even though it is a matter that the Liberal Party feels is critically vital and a matter that should be raised in the public. I presume that is the reason the leader of the official opposition stays away from that subject, because there is a lawsuit pending. Again it stems from this reasoning.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139358">The government could do that with every annoying issue. It can and it would.

In conclusion, I believe [the member for Dufferin—Caledon's] position of to be a perversion of the Code, which is not and was never intended to be a vehicle for attempted gagging or intimidation of Members of Parliament.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1139361">I agree that is a perversity.

It has four separate elements to it, two of which are not action oriented and two that are. One is that the House affirms its confidence in the Ethics Commissioner and that the House reaffirms all of the well-established privileges and immunities, especially with regard to freedom of speech. Those two, I suppose there can be no disagreement on. All members of Parliament know that we cannot operate without those basic rights. </ParaText><ParaText id="1139364">I do not understand why my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78631" Type="2">Dufferin—Caledon</Affiliation> is alleging there are two classes of people in the country if members of Parliament have privileges that members of the public do not. There are very sound and established reasons that members of Parliament have a so-called super freedom of speech. There are checks and balances in place as well in that what a member says here cannot be used anywhere else anyway.</ParaText>

It did not exist for all intents and purposes. When and if that libel action goes to court, the judge will rule on the evidence presented in the courtroom, not on what was said at a parliamentary committee, because any good lawyer would stand up and say that it is inadmissible. What the member said at the standing committee to the other player in that court action would be of no use and no value. </ParaText><ParaText id="1139366">Whatever seems to be a special privilege is offset by a corresponding limitation. In other words, that is one of the reasons a witness at a standing committee does not have the right to remain silent. The reason is self-evident, but the safeguard, the check and balance, is that the person has to answer the question, but what he or she says cannot be used against him or her in any subsequent court proceeding. In fact, it is even fruit of the tainted tree in terms of evidence. Whoever wanted to charge one with that issue would have to find some independent body of information not related to the testimony the person gave at the committee. I think that is brilliant, frankly. It took us a thousand years or so to arrive at that, but that is one of the fundamental rules of privilege as it pertains to Parliament that we now come to understand as being fundamental. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139367">Sometimes it is important to take one step back from the day to day events of Parliament, to pause and reflect on first, how beautiful an institution this is and how well it actually does work, and second, how we make sure that it is never eroded or undermined and that the efficacy is not chipped away at by interpretations such as this. It has to be fluid, just like the Canadian Constitution has to be flexible and adaptable. It is not static; it is dynamic. So too is Parliament and the rules that govern Parliament. </ParaText><ParaText id="1139368">We have stumbled across an area that needs attention and it is an appropriate time to do this in a minority Parliament.

The point I am making is nothing in today's motion says that members of Parliament should have the absolute freedom to go around and say whatever they want and not be sued.

If members do say something that is possibly libellous and they get sued, that should not automatically put a gag order on them to deal with that issue while that court action plays itself out. That is the difference here.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139375">To answer my colleague's question about the advantage or disadvantage, he should have more confidence and more faith in our judges and in the judicial system. When this lawsuit is finally heard by a judge, and I do not believe Mr. Mulroney will see the lawsuit all the way through, the judge is not allowed to use anything heard at the parliamentary committee. It is excluded; it is privileged.

We are dealing with sections 8, 12 and 13 of the Conflict of Code. The member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> was found to be in contravention of all three, but for subtly different reasons, which I do not think are important enough to go into.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139382">What is important is we need to amend the Conflict of Interest Code in the Standing Orders to make it abundantly clear that members of Parliament are not automatically deemed to be in a conflict of interest just because they are players in a libel suit. Nothing in what we recommend says members should not be used if they say something libellous. They made their beds and they can sleep in them. However, they should not be precluded or barred from speaking about that subject matter for the whole duration of the lawsuit until it gets resolved.

He is loyal to this institution.

I believe it was the Bloc intervenor who said earlier, and I am paraphrasing his French, that he is no fan of Liberals but he does defend the right of all parliamentarians to represent their communities and to speak out.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139392">I am a fan of the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation>, and I do not mind saying that, but it is very important to parse this and to say very clearly that we are not here as a party defending only the member for West Nova. We are here talking about each and every member of Parliament, and Parliament as a whole, with respect to their rights and privileges to represent the people of Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139393"> We are here speaking for the institution. To paraphrase the famous Jewish rabbi, Hillel, if I do not speak for Parliament, if we do not speak for ourselves, who will? And if not now, when?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139394">It is quite ironic, however, to say that here we are talking about a statement that was made outside the House regarding a matter that was very much part of the business of the House by way of extension in committee. That was the Mulroney-Schreiber affair. We are talking about a statement that was made about former prime minister Brian Mulroney. In almost two hours of debate now, there has been no mention of Brian Mulroney, what he did, what was said and why we are here. </ParaText><ParaText id="1139395">Is that not the strongest evidence of the chill about speaking out to issues, about speaking to power, so to speak? I might even sound like an NDPer here, if you will forgive me, Mr. Speaker. As for speaking to issues that are before us, they are not being spoken about at all because of the de facto chill that is in this place.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139396"> This means that we are not speaking at all in these two hours about Brian Mulroney accepting cash while he was still a member of Parliament and the statement the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> made, which was that he believed Brian Mulroney accepted money while he was an office-holder, when we know after the fact from the testimony that Mr. Mulroney met with Schreiber while he was prime minister and subsequently received money. It is not a stretch. I would love to see how this lawsuit turns out, if it ever gets there.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139397">Is this not more than just a libel chill we are talking about? Are we not really talking about a democratic chill? The libel chill is the agent used to chill democracy, to chill the right of the citizens to expect the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> and the members in the House to get up and pursue issues that are important to the continued democratic well-being of the nation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139398">I must get back to the idea of libel chill. Libel, of course, is something that is written. In this case, what is alleged, let us guess, is the form of defamation known as slander. There are many defences in the common law to any suit with respect to defamation, the first of which, the primordial one, is the truth. The truth is always a defence. The second, or the second branch, is the various defences of privilege, qualified and others.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139399">I come from a municipal background. In municipal councils across this country, there is not the form of parliamentary immunity and privilege that there is here, yet there is a qualified privilege for elected officials. There is a qualified privilege for people speaking out on public issues.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="10">(1210)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1139400"> I will quote now from a British House of Lords decision in 1974, without I hope offending any politician of any stripe, which puts in a nutshell why it is important for elected representatives to be able to speak out. The case refers to members of a local council at meetings or any of its committees speaking in colourful terms about issues and persons.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139401"> What was stated is that the reason there is a qualified privilege protecting non-parliamentarians but elected representatives is that:</ParaText><ParaText id="1139402"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">--those who represent the local government electors should be able to speak freely and frankly, boldly and bluntly, on any matter which they believe affects the interests or welfare of the inhabitants. They may be swayed by strong political prejudice, they may be obstinate and pig-headed, stupid and obtuse; but they were chosen by the electors to speak their minds on matters of local concern and so long as they do so honestly they run no risk of liability for defamation of those who are the subjects of their criticism.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1139403">Does that not encapsulate what we really think of democracy? We are not sending to municipal councils and to this place of Parliament the most careful individuals who never say anything outrageous, of course, and as a body all of us have the right to say things that are on the minds of the people. Sometimes those statements get pretty interesting. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139404">The principles laid down with the common law for councillors surely are expanded upon from the 1689 bill of rights, over which a king eventually lost his head, over which centuries of parliamentary privilege have evolved, to the point where what happens in this place, in the Parliament of Canada, is ruled by the rule of privilege that predated the creation of this Confederation in 1867. It certainly predates the Constitution Act of 1982 and has been ruled by the courts to be exempt from the charter of rights in almost every case.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139405">There are exceptions with respect to the Speaker. In fact, the firing, hiring and disciplining of staff is an example, as are many other administrative issues that deal with the private rights of individuals when they brush up against parliamentary privilege, but by and large, and my friends on the other side may not like this, it is the state of the law. The parliamentary privilege is immune from the charter of rights. It is an element in being that is different from the laws of the rest of this country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139406"> I think of other countries across the world where one can close out democracy by threatening to sue or suing someone. I do not think Canada wants to be on the list of some of these countries. In Singapore, for instance, it was de rigueur for political leaders in power to libel-chill opposition members to the point where they had to resign from Parliament and go out and make some money to defend lawsuits. It is not the kind of democracy or the vehicle for democracy that I think we want.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139407">To pick up on the point of the member for <Affiliation DbId="78531" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation>, and let us just pick on his party because he brought it up, his party often takes on certain groups or classes of entities in our community. I can think of the rhetoric and talk regarding big oil and big profits in these days of high gas prices. If this ruling, the interpretation of the Conflict of Interest Code in this case, were to stand and if we were to do nothing, it would not be difficult to envisage the big oil companies suing the leader of the New Democratic Party and anyone else in the party who espoused the view that big oil is making horrific profits at a time when the community is suffering from high gas prices.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139408">If that were the case, if every member of the New Democratic Party were sued for pecuniary damages and there were hearings at the natural resources committee or the environment and sustainable development committee with respect to big oil profits and gas prices, it would mean that no member of the NDP could serve on the committee, vote or ask questions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139409">When the Bloc member said he is no fan of the Liberal Party, I suppose I should say in fairness that per se I am no fan of the New Democratic Party, but I would defend to the death the right of the New Democratic Party to intervene on an issue that it thinks is pretty important, and which I can see from the perspective of all Canadians is important, and that is the price of gas.</ParaText>

It is not something that opposition members can say would not happen, particularly with respect to the rhetoric that we have heard from the other side today.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139411">Let us keep in mind that the conflict code says that if a member has a private interest or a conflict of interest, that member should recuse himself or herself from a matter before a committee or in Parliament. That seems pretty clear.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139412"> Where the train falls off the track and gets derailed is in the interpretation of “private interest” and “conflict of interest” and whether a lawsuit is meritorious or not.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139413">The member for <Affiliation DbId="78722" Type="2">Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre</Affiliation>, who is very experienced in the House, has been involved in procedure and House affairs for some time, so he did not just fall off the turnip truck. He not was told to make this statement. He believes it. He said that in the case of a legitimate lawsuit against a member where there is a pecuniary interest and so on, the member should recuse himself. </ParaText><ParaText id="1139414">With all due respect to the member and any member in the House, what is a legitimate lawsuit? An individual can go into court, start a notice of action with a statement of claim attached, at a cost of $120, and serve someone. It is considered legitimate if it is accepted by the court with a court stamp. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139415">My friend the member for <Affiliation DbId="78631" Type="2">Dufferin—Caledon</Affiliation>, the other twin pillar of reasoning over there, said there are remedies for that because the individual being sued can go to court and get the action thrown out. He would have us and members of the Canadian public believe that all one has to do is phone up a judge, meet him at Tim Hortons and tell him the lawsuit should be thrown out because it is vexatious. It is not that easy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139416">My colleague failed to mention that there are proceedings in court that have taken years with respect to whether a statement of claim discloses a cause of action or not, and the threshold is not that high. For an action to survive, one just has to show there is a scintilla of a cause of action, which will or will not be proven subsequently. As for what a “legitimate lawsuit” is, I have no idea. If it is filed and served and it is in the courts, it is a lawsuit.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139417">The next point was, what is a “private interest”? If someone is being sued for money, it is a private interest, I guess. The member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> is being sued for $2 million. That must make it a very big private interest. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139418">However, let me get back to the subject we cannot speak about, which is Brian Mulroney. He sued for many millions of dollars and eventually accepted nothing. His lawsuit against the Government of Canada was settled for costs. He did not get anything. Is that a private interest? Was that a legitimate lawsuit? Would that have put him in a conflict of interest? </ParaText><ParaText id="1139419">I think there are many questions are being raised by the Conservatives' interpretation of what a legitimate lawsuit is and what an actual private interest is.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139420">Finally, do the Conservatives agree that the commissioner, Mary Dawson, overstepped and misinterpreted the code? As an officer of Parliament, she is entitled to have an opinion. She is entitled to look at the documentation, the case law and the practice and precedents of the House and come up with a determination. Her determination was that liability, in the black letter law of the Conflict of Interest Code, includes contingent liability.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139421">One has to ask oneself, as the member for <Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation> said, what does that mean? What does a contingent liability mean? Is it the same as a legitimate lawsuit? Or in the case of the member for <Affiliation DbId="78631" Type="2">Dufferin—Caledon's</Affiliation> remarks, are we now going to include potential conflicts of interest?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139422">Is the intention of those members in opposing these changes, which every other party seems to be onside with, to say that in the case where there is a legitimate lawsuit and where there is a potential conflict of interest all members should recuse themselves from matters before the House regardless of who the litigant is?</ParaText><ParaText id="1139423"> I do have to take issue with where the member for <Affiliation DbId="78631" Type="2">Dufferin—Caledon</Affiliation> was coming from when he asked the House on May 7 if it matters who the litigant is.

All of us should be looking to having a code by which we can all live. It strikes me that “There but for the Grace of God go I” is a good way to look at this. </ParaText><ParaText id="1139427">Perhaps there will be a day when a Conservative member, who says something controversial having to do with matters before this House, will be sued for his or her comments by a group appearing before a committee. Perhaps that member would want to, on his or her own, suggest that he or she has a defence to the action even though it is alleged that the member made the comments. The member may decide to deal with it outside. The member may decide that he or she does not need the Ethics Commissioner or the Code of Conduct to tell him or her that he or she cannot represent his or her citizens. That is what this is all about. It is about whether we are representing the people of Canada. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139428">We are sent here as individuals to represent the people's interest and the privileges and immunities arrive out of the fact that it is the people's interests that are being protected. It is not to protect the individuals because they wear a nice suit, live in a nice house or are nice people. It is because the people of Canada in my riding, for instance, sent me here to speak out on concerns that are important to them. I will be judged, as will every member when an eventual election occurs, on whether we spoke out in the right way on the right subjects.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139429">However, for now we are here bringing up subjects and speaking to them. To preclude a member of Parliament from participating in a committee or voting or speaking on an issue in this House is to deny the people who sent that person the right to speak. That is the whole basis of why a Speaker, when chosen, symbolically reluctantly moves to the chair and a new member is symbolically reluctantly moved into the House. It is because there was a fear of the sovereign that he or she would do something bad to the people who spoke out for the Commonwealth, for the people, in exercising their concerns.</ParaText>

It seems to me that in some cases privilege is attacked, what people say in the House is attacked, as it says at page 23, because there is a “loss of conviction on all sides in its superiority”. That is immunity in Parliament. “Hence the power of slogans such as 'the democratic deficit', multi-partisan in appeal within the Commons and popular with press, public, and academics outside” seems to take hold.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139434">However, there is a bright note. We had the recent Supreme Court decision on the Canada House of Commons v. Vade case of 2005. I said earlier that the Supreme Court of Canada said that there was a certain immunity of Parliament, the privileges of Parliament, from the Charter of Rights. Over time, a certain loophole has evolved with respect to private matters as they respect other private person's rights butting up against Parliament's privilege.</ParaText>

I believe this is a very important debate and I am pleased to take part in it. </ParaText><ParaText id="1139469">However, before I get into the crux of my statements and argument, I just want to make one observation. I find it very interesting that the members opposite in the Liberal Party are now introducing a motion to basically challenge a ruling of an independent officer of Parliament. I find it interesting because they were very critical of the government when we took similar action.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139470">As is known, we have a dispute with Elections Canada right now over advertising practices and costs of the 2006 election. The Chief Electoral Officer of Canada made a ruling. We disagreed with that ruling and now we are engaged in a legal action because we believe a court of law will prove that our interpretation of the electoral law will be proven correct.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139471">While we have taken that legal action, members of the party opposite have been very critical saying on many occasions that the ruling of the Chief Electoral Officer at Elections Canada must be correct. Elections Canada made an interpretation therefore it must be correct, yet when the Ethics Commissioner made a ruling with which the Liberal Party members disagreed, they have done the same challenge. They are not going to court to try to overturn the ruling, but they are trying to change the rules of the Conflict of Interest Code. </ParaText><ParaText id="1139472">It appears that there is a little bit of hypocrisy going on here if, in fact, the position of the Liberal Party is that Ms. Dawson made an incorrect ruling. The Liberals certainly have a right to do what they feel they need to do to overturn the ruling or to rectify what they consider to be a wrong, as do we. </ParaText><ParaText id="1139473">I would just point that out. Let us make sure that if we are having a debate, we keep things on an even keel and make sure apples are apples and oranges are oranges in our discussion when criticizing other political parties.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139474">I want to begin by going back a little bit in time for those people who may be watching this debate and may be feeling a bit confused about what actually is going on here, and try to set the context of how this motion came to be, and why the debate is taking place today.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139475">As we all know, several months ago the ethics committee, a standing committee of the House, decided to hold investigations and hearings into what is known to be the Mulroney-Schreiber affair. I do not have to go into details about what that affair is. I think all Canadians, and certainly members of this House, are well aware of the dealings between Mr. Mulroney a number of years ago and Mr. Schreiber, but in any event the ethics committee decided it should have a set of hearings to try to get more information about that.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139476">During the course of the lead up to that committee hearing, and into the early parts of that hearing, one of the members of that committee, the Liberal member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation>, made some comments outside the House which Mr. Mulroney found to be defamatory. Subsequently, Mr. Mulroney filed a lawsuit against the member for West Nova. </ParaText><ParaText id="1139477">Once that had been done, another member of the ethics committee, the Conservative member for <Affiliation DbId="78631" Type="2">Dufferin—Caledon</Affiliation>, in a point of order, asked the member for West Nova to recuse himself because the member for Dufferin—Caledon stated that there was a private interest involved, and since the member for West Nova was being sued by Mr. Mulroney, the member for West Nova should not have the ability to question Mr. Mulroney, should not have the ability nor should he be a part of the committee that is conducting the investigations because it would be a conflict of interest.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139478">The member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> did not recuse himself so subsequent to that the member for <Affiliation DbId="78631" Type="2">Dufferin—Caledon</Affiliation> wrote a letter of complaint to the Ethics Commissioner asking her to get involved and subsequently give her interpretation, make a ruling, whether or not the member for West Nova should in fact recuse himself.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139479">The Ethics Commissioner did a quick investigation and came back with a report stating that, as the member for <Affiliation DbId="78631" Type="2">Dufferin—Caledon</Affiliation> suggested, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> should recuse himself, should not be able to participate in the hearings, and should not have been able to question or cross-examine Mr. Mulroney because there was a clear conflict of interest. </ParaText><ParaText id="1139480">That is where we are today because that was the genesis for this motion.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="45">(1245)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1139481">The Liberal Party clearly disagrees with the ruling of Ms. Dawson and wants to change the rules that we are governed by in this place to allow, in the future, members of Parliament, who have been served with a lawsuit, the ability to speak about that very lawsuit or about issues surrounding the lawsuit.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139482">That is the question we have before us. Is the current code of conduct and code of ethics proper or should it be amended? I would suggest, with great respect to all of the members opposite, that I do not think that the motion we have before us today for debate should be carried or passed, for a number of reasons.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139483">Let me begin, when making my argument, talking about what the code now says and then why it says it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139484">Right now the code basically says that the interests of the general public should supercede private interests of MPs. In other words, we were elected to represent the general good, not to represent our own self-interests or perhaps even our own partisan interests.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139485">Second, the code states that there should never be any conflict of interest that any member of Parliament finds himself or herself in. That sometimes is difficult to avoid, but I believe it is very easy to interpret. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139486">The code further goes on in section 8 to say that it provides a general prohibition on members acting in any way to further their private interests, whether they intended to or not.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139487">The code also goes on to say, in section 13, and I think this is the critical section, that it prohibits any MP from participating in any debate in the chamber or in a committee in which he or she may have a private interest.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139488">That is what the code states. I do not think there is any confusion about that and there should not be any question that the ruling by Ms. Dawson was a correct one, because here we have a situation where there is clearly a private interest by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139489">As I said earlier, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> is being sued by a private citizen, a former prime minister of this country, Brian Mulroney. Therefore, any discussion about that lawsuit or any discussion about elements of the lawsuit should not be allowed.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139490">Why is that? Why would the code of conduct put those provisions in? Quite clearly, it was done so for a very good reason. As one of my colleagues, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78631" Type="2">Dufferin—Caledon</Affiliation>, earlier pointed out, since the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> did not recuse himself and was subsequently allowed to cross-examine Mr. Mulroney during committee hearings, he in fact was allowed to gather information which could be beneficial to him in the upcoming lawsuit. The code of conduct clearly states that should not be allowed because he is satisfying or serving his own private interests.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139491">While it is very true, as other members have stated, that information gathered from committee hearings cannot be used in any lawsuit, the fact of the matter is that the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> was able to gather information which would benefit him in his lawsuit. He does not have to take testimony from his cross-examination. He does not have to take testimony from Mr. Mulroney and enter it as evidence in the court case, but the mere fact that he was able to gather knowledge from his questioning of Mr. Mulroney benefited him.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139492">Second, this case was such a widely known case and garnered such interest from the Canadian public. It was covered so extensively by members of the national media. Since the committee hearings themselves were televised, all of the information that came out of those committee hearings then became a matter of public domain. Canadians from coast to coast to coast would hear daily news reports about testimony at committee.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="50">(1250)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1139493">Canadians who had a great interest in the hearings were able to tune in and watch the committee hearings live. Many committee members, including the chair of the committee, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation>, constantly appeared on political talk shows during the hearings.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139494">To suggest that the testimony itself could not be used in a court of law and therefore it could not be of any benefit to the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> is absolutely ridiculous. Everyone in Canada, who had an interest in this case, was able to ascertain what was happening on a daily basis. In some cases, it was on a minute by minute basis if they happened to tune in to the live proceedings.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139495">The Code of Conduct was established to disallow any member from participating in a discussion about a lawsuit involving the member of Parliament. By doing that, it could advance the private interests of the member of Parliament. This is specifically prohibited in the codes that govern us.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139496">As I mentioned earlier, I take very seriously all the rules that govern us. As members of Parliament, we should also be very cognizant of the fact that this motion could set a very dangerous precedent. I say that because we have many, what I would loosely call, rules that govern and guide us in our day to day work. We have the bible of procedures and practices, Marleau and Montpetit, the Standing Orders and codes of conduct. </ParaText><ParaText id="1139497">If we choose to change Standing Orders or elements of the Code of Conduct, it obviously affects all of us, and it will have consequences. That is why, before we engage in any change, the history of this place has always been to be consultative, to consult widely and broadly, not just with members of the House but with others who have an interest, a knowledge and an expertise in parliamentary affairs.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139498">I assume the motion is brought forward with every non-partisan intent in mind. I do not believe the member for <Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation> has brought it forward in a partisan way to try to benefit the Liberal Party of Canada. I believe he brought this motion forward because he believes the code should be changed. However, I argue that the ramifications and the consequences of the change, should the motion be approved, will be very detrimental to the dealings of everyone in the House.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139499"> Let me give a few examples. Some may consider these to be extreme, but I can see where some of these examples could actually happen and could quite likely happen.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139500">If the changes are made to the code, if the motion is approved, it will allow members of Parliament to speak freely on any issue in which they may be legally involved. In other words, if private citizens decided to sue members of Parliament over any issue, those members would then be able to, in effect, use this place as a bully pulpit to speak about that issue without fear of consequence. They would be able to, either in debate, or in committee or in member statements, if they wished and depending on the subject material, speak about the issue quite freely, advance their own interests in other words and advance their own arguments before any court case was held.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139501">In my opinion, this should not be allowed to happen. That would be giving a distinct advantage to a member of Parliament. It would allow the private interests of a member of Parliament to supercede the interests of the general public.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139502">Second, I hear, time and time again, members opposite and members in this debate say that the way the current code is written allows for libel chill to occur. They are referring to frivolous and vexatious lawsuits being entered or being launched to try to curtail debate. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1139503">It is true, whether it be in this place or in the purview of the general public, many times individuals launch frivolous and vexatious lawsuits to try to engage in some sort of libel chill, to keep someone who is speaking the truth quiet. I suggest we do not have to alter the code to deal with that. The courts are the best judge of what is frivolous and vexatious.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139504">We have seen this time and time again. When someone has launched a frivolous lawsuit, the defendant goes to the court, says so and asks the judge to make an interpretation. That is how we deal with frivolous lawsuits. We do not change the code because we think that in the future there will be a raft of these frivolous and vexatious lawsuits in an attempt to quiet debate and discussion. There are many legal remedies to deal with that.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139505">However, if there is, what I call, a legitimate lawsuit, one that is proven by courts and interpreted by judges as to be not frivolous and vexatious, brought forward by a member of the general public against a sitting member of Parliament, that member of Parliament should not be allowed to use his or her privilege in this place to gain an advantage over the private citizen. Why should he or she?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139506">The current code is absolutely correct. If we change it, we head down a very slippery slope, and not only in this case. I know this is a very narrow cast example. This was obviously brought forward because the member for <Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation> did not feel it would be appropriate to disallow the ability of the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> to speak on the Mulroney-Schreiber proceedings.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139507">What happens in the larger picture if we agree to the motion? In fact, it could happen now but I think a precedent would be set if the motion were passed. However, if any government, regardless of political stripe, gained a majority in the House and simply did not like a Standing Order, a code or any independent officer of Parliament's ability to interpret and adjudicate, is it could simply change the rules. Quite genuinely, I would hate to see that happen. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139508">I would hate to see any government of the day, in a majority situation, have the ability if a Standing Order did not serve its partisan purposes, to use its majority and arbitrarily change it. I fear the change proposed in the motion would set a very dangerous precedent. Normally and historically, any changes to Standing Orders or any rules that govern this place and members of Parliament have not been dealt with in this manner. It has always been dealt with in a consultative way, usually through procedure and House affairs.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139509">A number of people have referred to the fact that the procedure and House affairs committee is not sitting, and that is quite true. As a member of that committee, I have intimate knowledge of why the committee is not sitting. I suggest that if, as an example, the Liberal Party of Canada, the Bloc Québécois and the NDP all agree that procedure and House affairs could resume sitting to deal with this issue and this issue only, there would be widespread support from all members. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139510">Unfortunately, there is a motion currently before the procedure and House affairs committee, which the committee clerk and chairman ruled to be outside its mandate. That is the stalling point, because the majority members on that committee disagreed with the chair's ruling and with the law clerk of Parliament and got rid of the committee chair. Therefore, the committee is not sitting.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139511">I believe the procedure and House affairs committee is the right venue to discuss whether there should be changes to the Code of Conduct. It should not be done in this manner in this place in a one day debate. It should take place in a highly consultative manner through procedure and House affairs by bringing in expert witnesses and having a rational, fulsome discussion and debate. That is why I will be opposing the motion today.</ParaText>

First, his interpretation of why that committee is unable to deal with motions such as this is obscure and obtuse at the very least. The government has practised this willy-nilly form of obstruction among so many committees. It is unprecedented in Canadian history.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139514">I experienced this in the Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable Development. For six weeks the government talked out the clock on a private member's bill. It has never been done before in the history of Canada.

							<ParaText id="1139516">By finding a contentious issue that was affecting some other Canadian or somebody from another country, or by not wanting a certain member of Parliament to speak to the issue, a person could simply file a lawsuit.

Then our Ethics Commissioner would come forward and prohibit the member from speaking because of that lawsuit?</ParaText><ParaText id="1139517"> I am trying to understand the balance the member is trying to seek.

We are protected by privilege. It is only if we say something outside of this place.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139520">With the whole larger issue of libel chill, I mentioned in my statement that there were legal remedies to prevent that. However, the courts are the best ones to judge what is a frivolous lawsuit as opposed to a real or legitimate lawsuit.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139521">If there is a frivolous lawsuit, just for the purposes of libel chill, that is something I do not agree with, but the courts should be able to determine that. There are many remedies to stop that from happening, and I think the member knows that. Clearly, if there is an instance where a member of Parliament is involved in a lawsuit, the member should not be allowed in this place to speak of issues surrounding that.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139522">How many times have we heard outside of this place, non-members of Parliament, when asked a question, say that the matter is before the courts, therefore they cannot speak to it? That is a standard operating procedure by general citizens, not members of Parliament.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139523">All of a sudden we are saying that if there is a lawsuit, because a person is a member of Parliament, we will exclude that provision and allow the member to speak to it here. It is promoting self-interest, and that is something we have to take very seriously.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139524"> The overarching principle of this place is to put public interest ahead of private interest. In this instance, I believe the member for <Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation> thinks he is doing the right thing, because he does not believe the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> should be disallowed to speak of this issue, but it raises a host of other potential problems.

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Szabo" id="2514093"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78477" Type="2">Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1139556">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in this important debate on a motion raised by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation>. I must admit, when the House has been seized with some matter that is of a complex nature, whether it be interpretation of the Standing Orders or our procedures and practices, the member has always been an active participant with sage words for the House's consideration.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139557">I believe that the member has raised appropriately, based on the initial commentary of the Speaker with regard to his former question of privilege, the fact that there are other ways to do this. We have heard some suggestions. Why do we not send the matter to the procedure and House affairs committee where it could be taken care of?</ParaText><ParaText id="1139558">The last time that committee took care of a conflict of interest issue of review, it created a subcommittee. It sent it to the subcommittee, I think it was in November 2006, and we did not get a report back until June 2007. I think that, under any criteria, urgent decisions by this place on a clear question should not take several months to address.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139559">I have listened to the debate. I think that there has been ample discussion and presentation on the importance of free speech which is clearly the issue here. The crafters of the Constitution of Canada and our laws now in the Constitution have extended extraordinary privileges to members of Parliament. Those privileges, in brief, would include such things as the matter to speak freely in this place, to represent the interests of constituents without having fear of being taken to another jurisdiction and have it used against one in another jurisdiction or in a court of law, as one member said</ParaText><ParaText id="1139560">The decision to grant the privileges to parliamentarians was carefully considered and carefully done in a way in which the public interest could be served only if members had that free speech, the right to speak freely, to speak frankly, to tell it like it is as it were, because it is important in this place that this is where the debate should take place. This is where one has to push the envelope, where we have to make very strict and firm arguments. </ParaText><ParaText id="1139561">It may not be beautiful at all times, but it is our parliamentary practice and tradition. It is not a matter of trying to perform for some esoteric reason. It is to fight on behalf of what members believe to be the truth and fairness within the laws of Canada.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139562">We have this extraordinary privilege and what we have before us now is a situation where an extraordinary matter, the privileges of parliamentarians, is being suspended by a very ordinary act. It is simply to launch a legal action. In this case before us, it is a libel suit.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139563">The member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation>, in an interview outside of this place not covered by privilege, effectively indicated that a former prime minister accepted cash when he was prime minister. Mr. Mulroney contends that he received the money only as a member of Parliament after he had stepped down as prime minister. Consequently, he launched a $2 million lawsuit, the proceeds of which he indicated would go to charity.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139564">That is all well and good, but during the hearings there was a lot of evidence and testimony that we had during the Mulroney-Schreiber hearings. It is not clear yet, and has not been established yet, whether or not the former prime minister actually had received money while he was prime minister or the promise of money. </ParaText><ParaText id="1139565">He could have done certain things as prime minister with payment to be made only after he stepped down, but just as there is a contingent liability, if members would like to use that term, there also could be a contingent asset. It would be in order to circumvent the rules of this place, or in fact a statute of Canada, particularly the Parliament of Canada Act, which would deal with the issue of influence peddling.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="20">(1320)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1139566">Therefore, this is an extraordinary matter that is being undermined, mitigated and even shut out by an ordinary matter.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139567">There has been some argument that we need this to happen. There has been some argument that we need to have this recusal of the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> to participate in debate or votes or questions, because, as one member put it, members could use this place to advance their case. They could use this place and abuse it to further their own private interests.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139568">If members want to continue to argue their case and try to remedy their situation, they can do it outside of the Parliament of Canada, outside of this chamber or committee. They can do that. There is nothing to stop them. What could they do here that they cannot do out there?</ParaText><ParaText id="1139569">We have the situation reversed. We have a situation where members can say things in the House that they cannot say out there, but in this particular case, we have a situation where the decision of the Ethics Commissioner is that members can say anything they want out there but we will not let them say it in here. It is exactly the reverse. This is preposterous.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139570">The motion also, and I want to be clear on this point, refers to an exemption being proposed if a member is “a party to a legal action relating to actions of the Member as a Member of Parliament”. Some will interpret the words “legal action” as meaning a lawsuit, a court action, but there are many actions out there that involve a pecuniary interest to members. It could mean appearing before some tribunal or city council trying to get costs back or a reduction of property taxes or something like that where a member has argued. A judicial review could be a legal action in the context of what is being done here.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139571"> I raise this because in this place we deal with matters which touch on virtually the full gamut of issues that have touched the lives of Canadians. We will be there arguing on behalf of the interests of our constituents and of Canadians as a whole, but sometimes we will have to participate in fora outside this place.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139572"> If I can go to a tribunal, argue a case successfully and get a judgment or a decision that would affect the public interest, that is fine. However, what if I am seeking costs, the costs of my taking the time to do it, to get the research, to pay for the transcripts and to get legal assistance or other professional expertise? In themselves, those costs, and the recovery of those costs because I have successfully argued a matter that is not a private interest, represent a private interest, which I presumably would be advancing.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139573">The point I am trying to make here is that if this matter is not changed, things can occur which would say that members who are involved in some sort of a legal action, legal proceeding or litigious proceeding may have to be in a position to recuse themselves from discussing it in the House because they are out there trying to do something to get back costs. That is not the intent.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139574">I did what I could to determine whether or not there was any evidence of contingent liability being a subject of discussion by those who were responsible in the House to determine what the elements of our Conflict of Interest Code could be. I could not find any.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139575">In my view, and I hope members will look at it carefully, there is no evidence that the existence of a contingent liability was ever contemplated. It could be something like a frivolous lawsuit, somebody paying the thousand dollars and filing the necessary papers, and then the parliamentary secretary would say that the member has to wait because it is in the courts and that is the way we do this. If one gets sued, then one is going to have to recuse oneself and lose one's privileges and rights under the Constitution until that court deals with it. How long is that going to be?</ParaText><ParaText id="1139576"> There is a saying about how justice delayed is justice denied. Privileges being denied because of a frivolous and vexatious suit is an inappropriate outcome.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1139577">I also want to make the point that in the Ethics Commissioner's decision, she decided that the member for<Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation>, who was the subject of a lawsuit by Mr. Mulroney, must recuse himself and could not participate in debate or vote, the reason being that we are talking about whether or not there is a pecuniary interest, a private interest. That could be assets or it could be liabilities.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139578"> If we look in a dictionary, we will see that liabilities have a whole range of definitions. One of them happens to be a contingent liability. We are not sure what it is, but it could happen. Other things have to happen in order for that to be assessed and the amount determined.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139579">Did the crafters of our code of conduct decide that people could say that they thought someone was wrong so they would sue and find out in a couple of years from now whether or not the courts would agree, but that in the meantime before it gets to court they just might yank it and then the individual could go back? That is the problem.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139580">There is a further problem if we have a situation like this one where other parties are related to Mr. Mulroney or where Mr. Mulroney is involved in any other business. If there is anything that we do or touch or say that would directly or indirectly affect Mr. Mulroney adversely, should the members also recuse themselves or be recused and lose their privileges in regard to discussing those things? The example I would give is the spectrum wireless issue and Quebecor and whether or not the members should recuse themselves from talking about Quebecor because Mr. Mulroney is an officer of a subsidiary of Quebecor.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139581">There is another aspect that has not been considered. I raised it in one of the questions. If we are talking about just being sued, as is the case with the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation>, and there is a recusal required, what happens if one applies the same logic that has been applied to the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation>when a member of Parliament himself or herself launches a lawsuit? If that member of Parliament launches a countersuit in the case of Mr. Mulroney, or a lawsuit on any other matter that is before the House, the interpretation given by the Ethics Commissioner's report demands that the member recuse himself or herself from participation in any vote, debate or questioning on any matter related to that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139582">Is it the intent of our code of conduct that a member cannot sue without giving up his or her privileges? It is the reverse situation, but we always have to look at what happens when we flip it on its head, start from the bottom up, or go in reverse or inside out. We have to look at all the angles.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139583">One of the members says that we should just send it to the procedure and House affairs committee, which has a good track record. Let me give the House example of how ridiculous it could become if we apply the rules.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139584">We have a situation now in which Elections Canada has named 17 members of Parliament in the Conservative caucus as participants in a scheme to circumvent the election spending rules as they relate to national advertising. They have been specifically named. In fact, there were 57 Conservative candidates. Of them, 17 were elected. They are all MPs, but of the 17, 10 are ministers or parliamentary secretaries and are also subject to an even more stringent code, that being the code for public office-holders, defined as cabinet members, parliamentary secretaries and governor in council appointees.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139585">If we were to apply the decision and the logic of the decision of the Ethics Commissioner in this regard, we would have a situation involving: the member for<Affiliation DbId="78517" Type="2">Kelowna—Lake Country</Affiliation>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="79032" Type="2">Cariboo—Prince George</Affiliation>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78876" Type="2">Okanagan—Shuswap</Affiliation>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78813" Type="2">Sarnia—Lambton</Affiliation>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="79030" Type="2">Louis-Hébert</Affiliation>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78391" Type="2">Charlesbourg—Haute-Saint-Charles</Affiliation>, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78459" Type="2">Lévis—Bellechasse</Affiliation>, the parliamentary secretaries for <Affiliation DbId="78944" Type="18">heritage</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="113993" Type="18">national resources</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="113998" Type="18">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and <Affiliation DbId="114000" Type="18">labour</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="78755" Type="4">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="105846" Type="96">Secretary of State and Chief Government Whip</Affiliation>, the <Affiliation DbId="78771" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation>, the former <Affiliation DbId="78461" Type="2">minister of foreign affairs</Affiliation>, who has just been replaced, and the <Affiliation DbId="105844" Type="5">Secretary of State for Agriculture</Affiliation>. All of those 17 members of Parliament, 10 of whom are public office-holders, should be recused from voting, debating or participating in any shape or form on any matter related to Elections Canada, because that matter is before the courts. The Conservative Party of Canada has taken the matter to the courts.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="30">(1330)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1139586"> Elections Canada has made a finding. Not only has Elections Canada found that the Conservative Party of Canada violated the Canada Elections Act and overspent the advertising spending limit, but it has implicated and named specifically 17 members of Parliament. Those 17 members of Parliament filed election expenses returns after they became members of Parliament and those 10 became public office-holders. They filed returns. They and their chief financial officers swore and signed and said that the returns were fair and audited and everything was in good order.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139587">Elections Canada said no to that. Elections Canada said that in its opinion that was not the case, that the returns were false and misleading. That is the allegation before these members. It would appear on a prima facie basis that the allegation, a contingent liability to either repay or to reduce the amount one is going to get back on an election rebate, is a pecuniary interest. It is not a contingent liability. It is a contingent reduction in an asset that members have determined is theirs. Elections Canada has said no.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139588"> It will now have to go to the courts, but until that is done, and it is going to take years, perhaps those 17 members of Parliament had better pay a visit to the Elections Commissioner and suggest that because they have this thing hanging over their heads they should not be participating and they should recuse themselves and not participate.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139589">That is how ridiculous it gets. It is certainly not my suggestion or intention that this should ever happen, but if we want to apply the rules and the intent of the Conflict of Interest Code, we cannot do it on the narrowness of determining it in the worst possible case, a frivolous and vexatious libel suit. An ordinary action could be done by almost anybody on almost anything because it is their own opinion, not the opinion of the courts. Almost anybody could commence an action, in this case a legal action, and it would take away, in whole or in part, the privileges of a member of Parliament that have been granted to that member by our Constitution. That is how serious this is. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139590">This has the potential to get much wider and to cover more subject matters and more integrated matters, because we know that things are inextricably linked.

That is why I believe the motion, the debate and the argument brought forward by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation> are cogent and wise and that this is the right thing to do.

The Liberal motion seeks to amend the current code of ethics so that a member who is being sued is not deprived of his or her right to speak. Freedom of speech is indeed at issue today.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139955">On May 7, one of our colleagues in this House lost his right to speak at the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics and in all committees examining the Mulroney-Schreiber affair, as well as in this House. He is the only member who cannot legally speak today, on this Liberal opposition day. I am talking about the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation>. This makes no sense, and it is essential that the code of ethics be amended to correct this situation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139956">I would like to give a bit of background. On May 7, Ethics Commissioner Mary Dawson handed down a decision that gagged the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> and prohibited him from taking part in any parliamentary investigation into the Mulroney-Schreiber affair. This decision opens the door to using SLAPP suits against elected members. We know that this happens frequently in the private sector. This would enable private interests to restrict parliamentary independence and prevent members from discussing issues of public interest.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139957">This decision comes in the wake of a complaint filed in November 2007 by a Conservative member, who asked the ethics commissioner to investigate in order to determine whether the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation>, a Liberal member from Nova Scotia, had failed to meet his obligations under the conflict of interest code for members by taking part in a study by the ethics committee on the Airbus affair involving Mr. Mulroney.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139958">In his request, the Conservative member referred to the legal proceedings instituted in mid-November against the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> by Brian Mulroney, who is seeking $2 million in damages. The member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> allegedly made libellous comments about Mr. Mulroney when he appeared on <I>Mike Duffy Live</I> on October 31, 2007. The issue is whether the member was in conflict of interest when he took part in the work and debates of the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics regarding the Mulroney-Schreiber affair.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139959"> More specifically, it must be determined if the lawsuit against the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> means that he now has a personal pecuniary interest that might incline him to use his public role—his participation in the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics—to gain information and thus discredit Mr. Mulroney so that the lawsuit would be dropped, and he would not have to pay out the millions of dollars being claimed. </ParaText><ParaText id="1139960">In her decision, the Ethics Commissioner agrees with the Conservative member and concludes that the potential damages award in the libel action instituted by Mr. Mulroney against the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> constitutes personal interest which could reduce the value of his assets. Given this interest, the member for West Nova should recuse himself and no longer participate in parliamentary business pertaining to the Mulroney-Schreiber affair.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139961">The member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> is now stripped of an important part of his parliamentary privilege, a principle that goes back to 17th-century England and gives members protected rights, rights such as freedom of speech and freedom from arrest, and allows the House to freely conduct inquiries and proceedings without fear of unjustified interference from the courts or the executive.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139962">So much for the facts.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139963">Let us move on to the interpretation of the code of ethics. We must ask ourselves: was it the intention of those who wrote the code to silence members this easily? I do not believe that the authors of the code would want members to be silenced this way. I do not believe that they would want the most important privilege for members of this House to be taken away, in whatever way and for whatever reason.</ParaText>

I quote:</ParaText><ParaText id="1139965"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentRest="1" IndentFirst="2">The privilege of freedom of speech in parliamentary debates or proceedings is generally regarded as the most important of the privileges enjoyed by Members of Parliament and witnesses that appear before parliamentary committees.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1139966"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The right of parliamentarians to freedom of speech is protected by the Constitution Act, 1867 and the Parliament of Canada Act, R.S.C., 1985. Section 4 of the Parliament of Canada Act confirms that the Senate and the House of Commons each enjoy all of the privileges of the British House of Commons at the time of Confederation. This includes the parliamentary freedom of speech guaranteed by Article 9 of the British Bill of Rights of 1689.</QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139967">Here is what Marleau and Montpetit has to say about parliamentary immunity:</ParaText><ParaText id="1139968"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Freedom of speech permits members to speak freely in the Chamber during a sitting, and members and witnesses to do so freely in committee meetings, while enjoying complete protection from prosecution or civil liability, or, in the case of witnesses, reprisals, for any comment they might make. Members are able to statements or allegations about outside groups or people, which they may hesitate to make without the protection of privilege. Though this is sometimes criticized, the freedom to make allegations which the member genuinely believes at the time to be true, or at least worthy of investigation, is fundamental to the privileges of all members. The House of Commons could not work effectively unless its members, and witnesses appearing before House committees, were able to speak and criticize without being held to account by any outside body.</QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139969">
								<Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Although the parliamentary privilege of freedom of speech applies to a member’s speech in the House of Commons and in other proceedings of the House, including committee meetings, it may not fully apply to reports of proceedings or debates published by newspapers or others outside Parliament. Privilege may not protect a member republishing his or her own speech separately from the official record of the House of Commons or one of its committees. Comments made by a member at a function as an elected representative—but outside of Parliament—would likely not be covered by this privilege, if the member were quoting from his or her own speech made in a parliamentary proceeding.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1139970">Marleau and Montpetit says more about the work of a member.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139971">This freedom of speech is extremely important in this chamber. In fact, it is the most important of our privileges. This would be very dangerous to freedom of expression, which is recognized as necessary for hon. members to truly play their role. Parliamentary immunity is necessary for hon. members to do their work, and much of their work is done in this House and in committees.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139972">This is strangely similar to a SLAPP suit. If the Liberal motion does not pass, it could result in a large number of what are commonly referred to as SLAPP suits, in other words, lawsuits filed with the intention of silencing people.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139973">We know that large companies, who have not necessarily had a very environmentally conscious attitude, have been criticized by the public. These large, rich and powerful companies have filed very large suits against average citizens who do not have any money, which results in muzzling those citizens. Usually an average citizen who is sued for $1 million, $2 million or $3 million for criticizing the environmentally irresponsible attitude or behaviour of a large company ends up, despite his or her good intentions, going home and focusing on mowing the lawn and paying less attention to the environment and the conduct of large companies, even when that conduct is irresponsible.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139974">That is a SLAPP suit.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="20">(1520)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1139975">That is what seems to be happening now. A lawsuit has been filed against a member of this House, who has lost the right to speak freely. This kind of SLAPP suit would be even more effective because it would be automatic. It would be part of the code of ethics. SLAPP suits filed by big companies against private citizens work because intimidation silences them, not because of the law. </ParaText><ParaText id="1139976">This would give too much control to the rich and powerful. From now on, “tyrants” or perhaps even “dictators” might be more appropriate descriptions than just “the rich and powerful”. This would be a new threat against members of Parliament, a new kind of blackmail and manipulation, a new kind of democracy. Democracy as we know it would cease to exist.</ParaText><ParaText id="1139977">I would like to talk about what the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics went through at the height of its work and hearings surrounding the Mulroney-Schreiber affair. We received lots of letters from lawyers representing all the parties involved. Many of the letters were from Mr. Mulroney's lawyers, and some were from Mr. Schreiber's lawyers. The letters we received constantly attempted to undermine our mandate. The lawyers questioned our questions and the members' conduct.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1139978">We felt manipulated. They picked apart every aspect of our mandate and continually asked us about the questions we intended to put to the witnesses, the documents we were expecting, and the names of the witnesses who would be appearing before us.

The parliamentary privilege of freedom of speech applies to a member’s speech in the House and other proceedings of the House itself, but may not apply to reports of proceedings or debates published by newspapers or others outside Parliament ... Thus, comments made by a member at a function as an elected representative—but outside the forum of Parliament—would not be covered by this special privilege.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1140031"> The second edition of Maingot's Parliamentary Privilege in Canada states, on page 42, that parliamentary privilege protects the member “when he speaks in Parliament, but when he speaks outside, or publishes outside what he says inside Parliament, Parliament offers no protection; only the common law does, if it is offered at all.”</ParaText><ParaText id="1140032">Speakers have reminded members of their duty to be careful in using their privilege to speak freely. We know all too well that members are not always as careful as they should be.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140033">Outside the House, as Marleau and Montpetit points out on page 76, “Members also act at their peril when they transmit otherwise libellous material for purposes unconnected with a parliamentary proceeding.”</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140034">Marleau and Montpetit adds that the publication of libellous material has been considered by most courts to be beyond the privileges of Parliament when it was not part of the parliamentary process to begin with.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140035">Maingot states on page 42 that a member could not come to Parliament for protection if he was sued for comments made outside Parliament. Maingot goes on, citing a series of British suits from 1794 that support the principle whereby parliamentary privilege does not apply to comments made outside Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140036"> In the Abingdon case, in 1794, involving a speech published in several newspapers by Lord Abingdon, the court ruled that the legislative provisions on libellous material applied to Lord Abingdon because he made the comments in question outside Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140037"> In the Creevey case in 1813, the court ruled that a member is protected when he speaks in the House but not “when unauthorized by the House.”</ParaText><ParaText id="1140038">Maingot concluded that members could not complain in the House if they were convicted for libellous material outside the House. Maingot cites the report of the committee on defamation, presented to the British Parliament in 1975 by the Lord High Chancellor and Lord Advocate, whereby, “no parliamentary privilege attaches to the repetition outside Parliament of statements previously made in the course of Parliament proceedings.”</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="45">(1545)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1140039">As Maingot points out, the Canadian system is similar to the British system when it comes to the application of parliamentary privilege within Parliament and subjecting members to the laws of Canada regarding statements made outside of Parliament. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140040">The opposition motion we are debating here today raises some fundamental questions for members, questions that have to do with their parliamentary privilege to speak in this House and the limits of that privilege outside this House.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140041">Members enjoy freedom of speech in the House in order to be able to fulfill their duties as elected officials. At the same time, members must be accountable for the statements they make outside the House, just as all Canadians are.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140042">The principle has two components.

In this way, the parliamentary institution is protected, so that debate may be free and unfettered, while any statements made outside Parliament are subject to the laws of the Canadian legal system.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140043">However, parliamentary privilege is not absolute, despite the fact that it is critically important for members and their ability to carry out their parliamentary duties. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140044">In some cases, the House has decided to limit privileges in order to achieve other objectives, particularly by creating the Conflict of Interest Code. For instance, under the code, members cannot take part in a debate or a vote if it could further their private interests.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140045">Section 8 of the code is clear:</ParaText><ParaText id="1140046"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">When performing parliamentary duties and functions, a member shall not act in any way to further his or her private interests or those of a member of the member’s family, or to improperly further another person’s or entity's private interests. </QuotePara></Quote>

A fair balance must be established between high ethical standards and the privileges of individual members.</ParaText>

She says in her report: </ParaText><ParaText id="1140052"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">I must balance this consideration, however, against the recognition that it is one of the main objectives of the Code to ensure that Members perform their public duties in a way that fosters the confidence of the public in the way these duties are performed. The purposes and principles of the Code are set out in sections 2 and 3 of the Code. I quote, Office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner 21 for example, the introductory words of subsection 2 (1) and paragraph (b) of that subsection: </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1140053"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">“2.(1) Given that service in Parliament is a public trust, the House of Commons recognizes and declares that Members are expected</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1140054"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">… </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1140055"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">(b) to fulfil their public duties with honesty and uphold the highest standards so as to avoid real or apparent conflicts of interests, and maintain and enhance public confidence and trust in the integrity of each Member and in the House of Commons;” </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1140056">In other words, she had to choose between members' rights and the need to establish rigorous ethical standards. The commissioner decided that observing the principles laid out in the code was more important.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140057">Like the commissioner, the government believes that ethics override member privileges. Canadians elected us so that we would guarantee strict ethical standards, and that is what we will defend. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140058">I should add that the commissioner's conclusions mirror the practices of other legislative bodies. Again in her report, she mentions the following: </ParaText><ParaText id="1140059"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Recognizing that the House of Commons shares its traditions and its privileges with other legislative bodies in Canada, and that the language used in many of the ethical codes and statutes established by those bodies is similar to that used in the Code, I consulted my counterparts at the Senate and in the provinces and territories to determine how they interpret the term “liabilities”. Most have responded and have confirmed that they interpret “liabilities” to include contingent liabilities. Many added that they interpret pending lawsuits as falling within the ambit of the term “liabilities”. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1140060">Consequently, the limits proposed in the report are in line with the limits imposed on legislators in other jurisdictions.

Furthermore, the questions before the Standing Committee were substantially overlapping with the very statements that were the essence of the lawsuit. A similar conjunction of circumstances is unlikely to occur frequently. Only where questions debated and voted on by the House or a committee relate to the private interest of a Member is he or she not permitted to participate.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1140064">Therefore, I am of the opinion that the opposition is exaggerating the impact of the commissioner's findings on parliamentary privilege.

She must be independent to effectively carry out her responsibilities. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140068">However, I believe that we are establishing a dangerous precedent by asking the House to change the code when the commissioner rules against a member. Our entire code of ethics would become meaningless if such a practice were adopted. In fact, it would become easy for a majority government to amend the rules if it did not agree with the commissioner.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140069">The House decided to appoint an independent ethics commissioner for good reason. Therefore, we must respect her decisions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140070">The motion moved today by the opposition, which we are debating outside the usual process for parliamentary study, leads me to ask the following question: is the member for <Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation> proposing that members should not be subject to existing laws when they make comments outside Parliament? Is he suggesting that members should not be held accountable for comments they make outside Parliament?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140071">The government believes that Canadian tradition with respect to parliamentary immunity should apply to the same degree it always has. Members should be able to speak freely in this House, but they should also have to take responsibility before the courts for comments made outside Parliament. Changing that would create a double standard for members and the people they represent with respect to things said outside Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140072">The government also believes that we must respect normal parliamentary procedure when the time comes to consider changes to the Standing Orders. To do otherwise would offend both the privileges we enjoy as members of Parliament and the Canadians we serve.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140073">During the last election campaign, the government committed to restoring accountability to Parliament and putting an end to the culture of entitlement.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140074">This opposition motion seeks to do exactly the opposite. This motion implies that when members do not like the rules of the House, they can simply make a motion to change them, without a thorough review. It implies that members believe that they, unlike all other Canadians, are not accountable for what they say outside the House. </ParaText>

It is essentially dysfunctional and has not met for a couple of months.

I have to tell the House and Canadians who are watching on television that I venerate this institution and I do not think changes should be made lightly.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140108"> However, there is no doubt that from time to time Standing Orders change. As a matter of fact, the Standing Orders were changed substantially when there was a Liberal minority government. The opposition members at the time, and the member's party was then in opposition, were very enthusiastic about changing some of the parameters around opposition days and what was votable.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140109"> Those changes seemed to be a success and have been made permanent. However, any change to the Standing Orders, regardless of the venue through which it flows, must come back to the House for a vote, an expression of the will of the House of Commons. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140110">I find a disconnect in his logic. He argues that this is not the place where the debate should happen or where the vote should take place. In essence, this is where the House expresses its will, no matter in what avenue this change is brought to the House. Our motion does support the Ethics Commissioner in her decision, in which she asked for clarity around this. This is an appropriate motion and this is the place where we should be debating and voting on it.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1140114">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to speak on this point today. I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="78499" Type="2">Eglinton—Lawrence</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140115">I am speaking in support of this motion sponsored by my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation>. This is a very important motion. As a matter of fact, it is fundamental to how we operate as members in the House of Commons.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140116"> There are several objectives in this motion.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140117">First, it affirms the confidence of the House in the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner. I think that is fundamental to this motion. This in no way says that we disagree with the commissioner. As a matter of fact, I was very impressed with my colleague when he stood up to say that he did accept the ruling of the commissioner.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140118">Second, it amends the Conflict of Interest Code for members of the House, which is an appendix to our Standing Orders. Our Standing Orders are basically the rule book under which this House and committees operate.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140119">Third, it refers an inquiry report that concerns specifically my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation>, and which was tabled in the House on May 7, 2008, back to the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner for reconsideration in light of the amendment we are considering today.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140120">Finally, the motion calls upon the House to reaffirm all of its well-established privileges and immunities, especially with regard to the freedom of speech. It is this privilege in particular, the freedom of speech, on which I want to concentrate my remarks today. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140121">Parliamentary privilege is defined in the <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I> on page 50. It states:</ParaText><ParaText id="1140122"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">--the rights and immunities that are deemed necessary for the House of Commons, as an institution, and its Members, as representatives of the electorate, to fulfil their [parliamentary] functions. It also refers to the powers possessed by the House to protect itself, its Members, and its procedures from undue interference, so that it can effectively carry out its principal functions which are to inquire, to debate and to legislate.</QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText><ParaText id="1140123">These rights and immunities can be grouped into two categories, the first group being the rights of the House as a collectivity. The second group consists of the rights and immunities of individual members of the House. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140124">With respect to the rights and immunities of individual members, the most important aspect of freedom of speech is in parliamentary proceedings. Quite frankly, without it, members would be unable to function in their parliamentary roles. These functions include debating issues and legislation as well as being able to ask questions: questions of the government, questions of other members, and questions of witnesses who appear before our communities.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140125">Any form of interference or intimidation that impedes these privileges which allow the members of the House of Commons to fulfill their parliamentary functions must be dealt with immediately. I would like to remind members of the comments of Speaker Bosley on December 11, 1984, in a ruling concerning an alleged contempt of Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140126"> On page 1114 of the House of Commons <I>Debates</I>, and I know, Mr. Speaker, that you have probably read these many times, Speaker Bosley notes:</ParaText><ParaText id="1140127"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">--the privilege of a Member of Parliament when speaking in the House or in a committee is absolute.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1140128">I underscore the word “absolute”. Of course, this important privilege, this absolute, carries with it great responsibility. As past Speakers have stated, members must use great care in exercising their right to speak freely, both in the House and in committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140129">In the end, all members of the House are ultimately accountable to their constituents and may well pay a political price for abusing this privilege that is necessary in order that each of us individually, and all of us collectively, are able to carry out our parliamentary functions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140130">Why must our freedom of speech be free of intimidation or obstruction when we seek to debate issues and when we seek to legislate or inquire? Quite simply, to get to the truth and to better serve our constituents.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140131">Our privileges are so fundamental that the Speaker, on behalf of all members, seeks these privileges at the beginning of each Parliament. Therefore, it is appropriate to deal with this motion today and to allow all members of the House to express their views on the motion before us.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140132">In the end, a final decision as to whether or not the Standing Orders need to be amended belongs within the House as a whole. In the end, if modifications to the Conflict of Interest Code are required, that decision rests with this House as a whole.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1140133">True, the motion in the name of the member of <Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation>, if adopted, would amend the Conflict of Interest Code for members of the House of Commons. However, in her ruling concerning the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation>, the Ethics Commissioner admits that the code could be adjusted.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140134">Earlier today, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78631" Type="2">Dufferin—Caledon</Affiliation>, as well as other Conservative members, suggested that any proposed amendment to the Standing Orders or to the Conflict of Interest Code should be done appropriately at the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. He suggested that there, and only there, was the proper place for such matters.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140135"> He blamed any logjam on the opposition. There is indeed a logjam, as this committee has been filibustered for seven months by government members to the point where it is now suspended without a chair because there is nobody from the government willing to stand up and have this committee go forward.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140136"> I believe the member for <Affiliation DbId="78631" Type="2">Dufferin—Caledon</Affiliation> needs to be reminded that any proposed amendment to the Conflict of Interest Code or Standing Orders made by a standing committee such as the committee on procedure and House affairs must ultimately be ratified by this House as a whole.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140137">The member also suggested that other avenues existed to make these proposed changes. Again, it is the House of Commons as a whole that has the final say on these matters, regardless of what avenue is chosen to pursue them.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140138">Allowing all members to express themselves, it is appropriate that this motion be here today. This motion follows a ruling of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner on May 7 with regard to the member for<Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation>. In order to not take up a lot of House time or to be repetitive, I would invite all members to actually read this report.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140139">By concluding that being a defendant in a libel lawsuit constituted a private interest, the Ethics Commissioner's ruling prevents the member for<Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> from speaking on certain matters, not to mention that this report purports to remove the right of the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> to vote on the Mulroney-Airbus matter.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140140">This is indeed a very slippery slope. The effect of this ruling potentially validates and gives credibility to a libel claim of any person or corporation deciding to sue a member of this House, before there is any conclusion to the suit. This libel chill could ultimately be used to prevent members from speaking freely in the House or during its proceedings.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140141"> I want to remind all members that this does not just apply to my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation>. It applies to each and every one of us in this House as parliamentarians. The best way to describe the seriousness of this issue is to quote my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation>, when he stated on May 26, 2008:</ParaText><ParaText id="1140142"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> Our free speech privilege is here.

							<ParaText id="1140147">In essence, the Ethics Commissioner did report the legitimate concerns of the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation>.

For example, in this instance, since Bill <Document DbId="3354384" Type="3">C-50</Document> has not passed, since there is not a regulatory process for inviting applications for funding, and since the due diligence has not yet been put in place for the funding of any application, why would someone deliberately mislead a significant segment of the auto industry or the manufacturing sector in order to realize their own personal gain? </ParaText><ParaText id="1140179">That is a logic that the Conservatives would think was acceptable when they are trying to shut down my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation>.

Clearly not, but they are legitimate questions to ask in a parliamentary environment.

It grows out of a series of events that involves the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> and really started as a result of certain comments he made on public television with regard to Mr. Mulroney. Those comments elicited a lawsuit from Mr. Mulroney against him for defamation. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140211">Subsequently, the same member, who sits on the standing committee on ethics in this Parliament, had the opportunity to examine Mr. Mulroney when he appeared before that committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140212">Subsequent to that, a complaint came from a member of the Conservative Party to the Ethics Commissioner that the conduct of the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation>, in questioning Mr. Mulroney in front of the committee, broke the ethical rules that we are all bound by in the House as members of Parliament.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140213">On May 7 of this year, the Ethics Commissioner presented her findings and recommendations. The report put forth a number of findings. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140214">Perhaps I will just digress for a moment. The motion by the member of the Liberal Party, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation> has, as one of its components, an acknowledgement that, in spite of the fact that he is obviously concerned about the ruling by the commissioner, the motion today, if it passes, will acknowledge that the finding she made and the determination and analysis she brought to bear is one that we are not criticizing. It is appropriate for that be part of the motion and I applaud my colleague for having included it. I think the last thing this Parliament needs is further criticisms of public servants and individuals who report to Parliament as parliamentary officers.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140215">I have to say that there are points that could be argued as to whether her analysis was accurate, but at the end of the day it was a reasonable interpretation of the ethical code that we are bound by in the House. I believe we must recognize that and recognize the role she played, the integrity and sincerity in the analysis that she did and the results that she came to, in spite of the consequences that it has. The rest of the motion is an attempt by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation> to correct those consequences by making amendments to the code and to, in effect, clarify what the proper role would be for a member of the House, who continues to sit in the House, having been made a party to a lawsuit. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140216">We are all assuming that this would always be the type of lawsuit that would involve libel, slander or defamation, but it could be any number of other issues in terms of a relationship between the plaintiff suing a member of Parliament. I think we need to be cognizant of that fact.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1140217"> In her determination, the Ethics Commissioner did take into account the concerns raised by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> if it was found that he had breached the code by questioning Mr. Mulroney in the types of questions he asked. He raised a number of concerns, but fundamentally the concern he raised was the difficulty for members to perform their duties if in fact members of Parliament were compelled to recuse themselves in all situations where a lawsuit crossed over.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140218">One of the concerns I have in terms of the burden it puts on us is the wording the commissioner used, that the work one is doing as a member of Parliament has to be closely related in terms of the interest that is at stake in the lawsuit. It is no more definitive than that. I think her ruling is in keeping with the code but it leaves a very serious consequence in terms of a potential abuse by someone taking a civil suit against a member of Parliament.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140219">The concern is that in this Parliament in particular, and I am being very careful to not be partisan here, I believe there have been lawsuits of a greater number that have occurred in the last two and a half years than in any previous Parliament historically in Canada. The concern is that if this ruling stands and the interpretation that has been applied by the Ethics Commissioner is enforced on an ongoing basis, are we left with the potential abuse that a number of members of Parliament would be restricted from doing what had been their duties at that point? </ParaText><ParaText id="1140220">The very basis of the conflict we are confronted with by the ruling from the Ethics Commissioner and by the motion that we have before the House today is to try to find the proper balance between the privileges we have as members of Parliament to freely speak on all issues at all times, perhaps very forcefully and aggressively at times, in order to properly do our jobs as members of Parliament. That is the one side. The other side is the potential abuse of performing those functions where it overlaps and contradicts the nature of the lawsuit that is going on. Trying to find that proper balance is really what today's motion is about, but it clearly sets out that conflict.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140221">We have had comments on both sides from some of the other members who have spoken today, perhaps in some degrees to an extreme, but let me address those extremes on both sides.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140222">The reality is that we do have some restrictions as members of Parliament in the way we conduct ourselves. I am going to use as an example the lawsuit that carried on, I think all the way to the Supreme Court, but it certainly went to the Federal Court of Appeal, on whether the human rights legislation applied to members of Parliament here on the Hill. Ultimately it was determined that in fact it did in that like all Canadians involved at the federal level in issues, in that case it was an employment issue, the human rights legislation applied to us and in some respects curtailed our conduct. We have accepted that. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140223">It is generally accepted that we are bound as members of Parliament by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, as all Canadians are. We hear from some, and I think again there are some members who have spoken today who have pushed it too far, that generally we have those restrictions but other than those, we have and should have absolute free rein.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="45">(1645)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1140224">Again, I would say, going back in history for hundreds of years, that in terms of our responsibility regarding our ability to do our jobs, we try to make any restrictions as absolutely minimal as possible so that we can represent our constituents as freely and, on a number of occasions, as aggressively as we possibly can. That is the idea, that restrictions are minimal, allowing us to do our jobs as broadly as possible.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140225">On the other side of this balance, I can point to practices that have grown up, rules that have been put into place that give us as part of the privilege of being members of Parliament, permission to conduct ourselves in ways that we do not give to any other citizen in the country. We know that we can stand in this House and libel, slander and defame someone with absolute immunity. Civil courts cannot touch us. Criminal courts cannot touch us, or could not, when we had criminal libel. That is the epitome of the freedom that we have here.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140226">There are other more minor ones. As an example, if we are involved either as a party or as a witness in a civil suit, we cannot be compelled as members of Parliament to testify or to pursue those lawsuits, either as a claimant or as a defendant, while the House is in session. There is a very broad interpretation about what it means for the House to be in session. We saw this as recently as a few years ago, in 2004. There were several lawsuits that involved one of the deputy prime ministers at that time where attempts were made to compel him to come and testify. In fact, there was an initial ruling by one of the courts that did say he had to and then, when it was pointed out what the history was, what the real rules were, it was struck down and he was permitted not to have to testify until he actually retired from office. We have those kinds of protections.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140227">We have a number of privileges, some of them simple ones. We have access to this building; we can walk in freely, without going through security. Other citizens of Canada, other people attending this building, cannot do that. There are a lot of those simple privileges. We have very minimal restrictions. We have very broad freedoms in this House.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140228">Fundamentally, the issue we are faced with today is the freedom of speech, the ability to speak out on an issue, including in this case, to question a witness in front of a committee, even when that questioning is going to overlap the very issues that are involved in the civil lawsuit that has been brought against the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140229">The determination we have to make in the vote later today is whether we are going to say that under those circumstances, the member is going to be allowed to continue to do his or her job, is going to be allowed to continue, again in some cases aggressively, to speak out on the very issue that is the essence of the lawsuit.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="50">(1650)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1140230">I think that every member of this House and every Canadian would like to think, and maybe it is a fond hope, that every member of Parliament would always conduct himself or herself in a responsible fashion, that we would not deliberately defame or libel anyone, that we would not take advantage of our freedom of speech here, our extended freedom of speech beyond what any other Canadian has even at other levels of government, that we would not treat that lightly, and that we would always treat it in a responsible way. That is obviously ideal. That is not going to happen. The reality is that on occasion there are going to be members of Parliament who are going to abuse it. I think we would all be extremely naive to think otherwise. That is one of the realities.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140231">On the other side of the coin is the other reality, that if we do not accept that at times there will be that kind of abuse, hopefully extremely rarely, that there will be the other abuse where an individual, sometimes even another member of Parliament, will sue a member of Parliament as a means of shutting the member up. Someone will bring an action either with merit or without merit against the individual member of Parliament in order to ensure that the member is no longer engaged in the debate that is going on around the particular issue, that the member has to recuse himself or herself from all debate and involvement in that regard.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140232">It is my personal position as a member of Parliament that that abuse is the greater risk than members of Parliament being abusive and irresponsible in their use of the very special privileges we have as members of Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140233">As a lawyer, I can think of some of my comrades here who will say that if the lawsuit is without merit, one can move fairly rapidly in court to have it dismissed because it is vexatious or frivolous. Those are the kinds of terms that are in our rules of practice, actually and are pretty common across the country. Having been involved in some of those lawsuits, I can say that in trying to get lawsuits dismissed at an early stage, the reality is that our courts bend over backward--and I am not being critical of them; I think the approach they have taken historically is the proper one--but the courts are very unwilling to find at an early stage of a lawsuit that it is vexatious or frivolous and should be dismissed. It just does not happen very often. In fact, it is close to being in the rare category.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140234"> Even though we are not a particularly litigious society, we still have a lot of lawsuits. Very, very few of those get dismissed at an early stage because they are without merit. The case usually goes on, sometimes to the eve of the trial and sometimes through the trial, before the case is dismissed, even though in retrospect it may have had little or no merit.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140235">We cannot rely on the courts to protect members of Parliament in that regard. If it appears on the surface that the case has any particular merit, it is going to be allowed to continue.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140236"> Then what we are faced with is the member of Parliament being shut out from the debate and from involvement in the debate sometimes for several years. It is not unusual for civil lawsuits in my province of Ontario to take that long.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140237">At the end of the day, there are two potential abuses here that we are trying to deal with. This motion by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation> addresses the more serious potential abuse, maybe even the reality since we are faced with it right now in one case. Therefore, members of the NDP are supportive of the motion. We will be voting in favour of it. Hopefully, that abuse that inevitably will come from certain irresponsible members of Parliament either in this Parliament or in the future will be an extreme rarity and we will never have to deal with it.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I will read what it would say.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140263"> Section 3(3) deals with whether and under what circumstances a member is considered to be furthering his or her own private interests and therefore potentially in a conflict of interest situation. It reads right now:</ParaText><ParaText id="1140264"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">For the purpose of this Code, a Member is not considered to further his or her own private interests or the interests of another person if the matter in question</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1140265"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">a) is of general application;</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1140266"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">b) affects the Member or other person as one of a broad class of the public; or</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1140267"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">c) concerns the remuneration or benefits of the Member as provided under an Act of Parliament.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1140268">The proposal is to add another section, which would be numbered (b.1), if the matter in question “consists of being a party to a legal action relating to actions of the Member as a Member of Parliament”.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140269">Essentially if members are involved in some kind of legal issue that has arisen because of an action they have taken in their capacity as members of Parliament, not their role within the parliamentary precinct within the areas where privileges are already protected, outside of the parliamentary precinct, or outside of the protections that are offered to us in debates in this chamber and in committees of the House, at that point they would continue to be protected. It amounts to a very substantial increase in parliamentary privileges. The question we ought to be asking ourselves is to what degree this might cause the rights of others in society potentially to be infringed upon, given that this is not the only process at work.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140270">There are really two conflicting processes at work here, both of which are entirely legitimate for their different purposes. The first one is the actions that we take as members of Parliament, either in the House of Commons or in committees. That includes investigations into all kinds of matters, including the matter that was under review in the ethics committee last November, the Karl Heinz Schreiber-Mulroney hearings, and any other topic at which we are looking.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140271">In that role certain rights are set aside for us in privileges. It is worthwhile remembering these privileges relate to our share in carrying on the business of Parliament. They are not our privileges, per se. They do not pertain to us as members of Parliament. We sometimes talk about our privileges, that our privileges were violated in this manner and could we please get a hearing before the procedure and House affairs committee as to the violation of our privileges. Strictly speaking, our share in the privileges that the House has in order to conduct its business were violated and only when the business of the House is in some way limited are these privileges being violated.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140272">I learned this myself about a year ago. I thought my privileges had been violated because some members of the House had taken personnel records, including my confidential personal records from when I was a staffer, had rifled through them and then displayed part of them on national television because they thought it would get a good media hit. They then put it on the Liberal website. I thought this was an abuse of my privileges. I think it was actually an abuse of my rights as a citizen to expect some privacy. However, in truth, in the end, the Speaker was correct when he ruled that this was not a violation of my privileges, per se. Therefore, we have to be careful in understanding what privileges are and in the fact that while they are vitally important, they are very limited in their nature.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1140273">At the same time, the rest of the world has certain rights. Parliamentary privilege ought not to intrude upon those rights. There are legitimate processes that Parliament can intrude upon, including court proceedings.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140274">The argument presented here by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation> and by the other persons who have been advocating on behalf of his motion is essentially that court proceedings, as the rules are currently written and as the Conflict of Interest Code is currently written as a part of the Standing Orders, effectively can intrude upon the privileges of members.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140275">The reverse can also potentially be true. It is for this reason that we ought to make a real effort to not hold separate hearings when something is before the courts, and frankly, I think we have been lacking in this regard in the current Parliament. We call this the <I>sub judice</I> convention. It is not black letter law. It is a convention. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140276">It was on this basis, for example, that many people on the procedure and House affairs committee, including me, objected to efforts to have independent hearings into the legal proceedings between a number of Conservative official agents and Elections Canada relating to election expenses that Elections Canada was refusing to rebate.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140277"> In fact, I made quite a long point of order on this point to the chair of the committee last August or September. He ruled in my favour, but subsequently his decision was overturned by a majority of committee and things have proceeded to disorder from there. However, the point to be made here is that bringing evidence before the House of Commons can disrupt proceedings in court. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140278">My colleague who spoke just recently suggested otherwise and in fact suggested that there is no danger that court proceedings can be disrupted by events that unfold here. I would disagree with him and so would the Ethics Commissioner, Ms. Dawson, who said on page 20 of the English version of her report into the matter regarding the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> that the member “contended that, even assuming he could obtain information” through the committee hearings at the ethics committee “that would be useful to his lawsuit, that information could not be used in the litigation because it would be subject to parliamentary privilege”.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140279">This essentially is the point that the member for <Affiliation DbId="78397" Type="2">Windsor—Tecumseh</Affiliation> was making just a moment ago. The commissioner continued and said, “This is true, but, as discussed in relation to section 12”, of the MP Code of Conduct, “information revealed during the committee discussions could lead to avenues whereby the same information could be obtained independently of the committee proceedings”. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140280">In other words, he really could have a major impact upon these hearings. Essentially what she is discussing and what we are discussing is a version of the <I>sub judice</I> convention, which has actually found its way, perhaps accidentally, into our Standing Orders via subsection 3(3) of the Conflict of Interest Code.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140281">I think we ought to act cautiously in dealing with this matter. Let me suggest a few things.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140282">First, thematically we are striking a balance between two conflicting legitimate processes that sometimes butt heads. When one faces this sort of situation, one ought to act as narrowly as possible. One ought to try to design whatever adjustment to the rules one is doing with the goal of dealing with the specific wrong that one thinks has occurred. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140283">Not everybody here agrees that the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> has been unjustly damaged by this situation that pertains under the current code. Some do. Let us for a moment step into the shoes of the people who say that his rights ought to be protected and privilege ought to be expanded to cover a particular right that right now has no protection. If one makes that assumption, one ought to design the language as narrowly as possible in the change to the code in order to not cause restrictions on legal proceedings in the other parallel process that could be problematic.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1140284">I note, for example, that as an alternative to what the member for <Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation> proposed, there was a motion proposed by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78531" Type="2">Winnipeg Centre</Affiliation> in committee, which would have said effectively that the definition of conflict of interest would not apply to individuals who are defendants in a defamation lawsuit. It was quite narrowly constructed. I believe that motion was passed by the committee, was sent here and was found to be out of order because of the fact that it was essentially not the purview of that committee to deal with this and ought to be dealt with by the procedure and House affairs committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140285">That motion is more narrowly constructed. Had that motion been adopted, it would not face the danger under the current very broadly constructed proposed amendment to the code that is going to allow protection when the member of Parliament in fact is engaging in or is causing litigation against someone else.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140286">Lest we think that does not happen, it very much does happen. The member for <Affiliation DbId="78329" Type="2">Ajax—Pickering</Affiliation> engaged or at least said he was going to engage in a lawsuit against Ezra Levant on the basis that Ezra Levant had written an article in his publication, the <I>Western Standard</I>, pointing out that the member for Ajax--Pickering had been complicit in private personnel records, including my own, being kept, effectively stolen, and held in the Liberal research offices, scoured through and read in detail. I know this because I went through my own documents afterwards and found Post-it notes attached to them, with comments, which then to some degree were displayed on national TV.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140287">For having raised that, Ezra Levant faced a suit. He would be in a situation, if this rule is passed, whereby the member for <Affiliation DbId="78329" Type="2">Ajax—Pickering</Affiliation> is able to engage in actions in the House which would prejudice these proceedings even though he is the one who instigated the lawsuit. That is a very serious matter. Although he is a particularly litigious member, he is not the only person who engages in this sort of thing. The amendment to the rules that has been proposed by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation> could have been drawn more narrowly so as to avoid this danger.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140288">Let me suggest another change that could have been made and would have been narrower and therefore safer. Section 13 of the code could have been rewritten so as to narrow down the danger. This was mentioned in the Ethics Commissioner's report as being an area where the member for<Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> was found to be in violation of the code because he had violated section 13. Section 13 now reads:</ParaText><ParaText id="1140289"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">A Member shall not participate in debate on or vote on a question in which he or she has a private interest.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1140290">This is actually something that I raised in my question to the member for <Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation>after he gave his initial speech. Perhaps there is merit to narrowing that. Voting on a matter is very different from engaging in cross-examination and the extraction of evidence, which could have the effect, as the Ethics Commissioner noted, of causing the legal proceedings in question to be prejudiced.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140291">There again, we could have looked at making an amendment to section 13, saying effectively that a member could vote and maybe even speak in the debate but not actually engage in cross-examination in committee. None of that is explored in this relatively unsubtle motion that is before the House.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140292">I think this points to the need for having a little more time to look at this material and the proposed change and see if there are alternatives that are less aggressive than what is being proposed here. This is the merit of going to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140293"> I know there are concerns that the committee is not sitting currently. There are ways around that. The other side could stop objecting to having the member for <Affiliation DbId="78351" Type="2">Cambridge</Affiliation> sit as the chair of the committee and stop trying to dragoon the member for <Affiliation DbId="78896" Type="2">Oxford</Affiliation> as chair of the committee when he does not want to serve on the committee. The committee would be up and running again and we could then deal with this matter. That, I think, would be a very simple way of starting to review this.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="20">(1720)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1140294">The Ethics Commissioner specifically mentioned in her report that she had gone to other jurisdictions, other provinces around the country, and asked their ethics commissioners how they handled this kind of situation and had drawn on their experience and the precedents from those other jurisdictions. We do not have the same opportunity.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140295"> However, if we had hearings, we would be able to call in witnesses, listen to what they have to say and make such adjustments as are necessary to find the appropriate balance. That is not going to happen, unfortunately, because of the way this motion has been introduced: in the House as opposed to in committee. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140296">The question arises, then, why is this being done this way? There is no generalized crisis. There is a specific problem, some members would argue, relating to one member and one set of hearings. I could editorialize on that, but let me just finish my thought.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140297">The Ethics Commissioner suggested that there might in the future arise a problem where litigation arises more widely. If that were to occur, this matter could be dealt with at that time.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140298"> I think a few things have been said here that a common sense interpretation of the facts would not bear out. I would just mention that the member for <Affiliation DbId="78397" Type="2">Windsor—Tecumseh</Affiliation>, in his comments a moment ago, suggested that nuisance suits are unlikely to be dismissed very rapidly, that it takes a certain amount of time, which I accept. I think there is some validity to that comment.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140299"> However, if we tie that in with a statement made earlier that perhaps big oil companies would go after the NDP and would sue each member individually as a way of shutting them down and making it impossible for them to vote, why stop with that nightmare scenario? Perhaps every interest group in the country will find ways of looking at the voting records of members and simply sue everybody who is on the other side of the issue from them, thereby causing to pass all kinds of crazy legislation that is not in the interests of Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140300"> This is clearly preposterous. That kind of nuisance suit would be dismissed immediately. I really do not think there is the great danger that is said to exist by some members. Also, if that danger were to arise, we could then have a debate such as this one, in which we would pass the appropriate amendment, thereby eliminating that particular danger. However, I would argue that it is a danger that does not actually exist and therefore there is no cause to deal with it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140301">Pre-emptively acting against some danger that nobody had ever thought of before seems a bit over the top. Acting by means of a very aggressive, wide-ranging change to the rules seems even less appropriate. Doing so without the appropriate committee hearings and without hearing from, among others, the Ethics Commissioner herself, in whom I assume the member for <Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation> has confidence, as he mentions it in the motion, also seems peculiar. On this basis, I would encourage all members to vote against this motion.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140302"> I would encourage either the member for <Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation> or perhaps the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> to cause his colleagues to drop the objections they have to the procedure and House affairs committee running appropriately and allow it to start doing its business again. This could be one of the very first orders of business if it is brought before the committee and a majority of members thought this was the appropriate course of action.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Again, I am making a series of suggestions as to the kind of narrow wording one could use, wording that refers specifically to this kind of problem could have been put in here, and I do not think anyone would deny that the concern she raised is a legitimate concern.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140310">Trying to find a way to answer the concerns she raised and at the same time deal with whatever other concerns exist here is a reason for balancing it. I think there is a bit of absence of a balancing act here.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Again, freedom of speech has been with us for many centuries now. It is well understood. It is consistently applied. It is part of what I consider to be parliamentary law. It is part of our Constitution. It was adopted when our Constitution was drafted in 1867 and the previous speaker referred to that, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140330">I will be the first to admit that there have been certain instances in this assembly where that right has been abused.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140331">That is as opposed to civil law, where if a member of Parliament, outside the chamber, says something that is not true, which is defamatory against another member of the public, that member is subject to the same obligations, the same sanctions, and the same rights as any other person. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140332">Those are the factual circumstances that led up to this particular investigation, apparently. I do not know all the facts but the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> said something outside the chamber that was offensive to a former prime minister. A lawsuit either has been threatened or has been started, and again that all took place outside the chamber.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140333">A complaint was made to the Ethics Commissioner. The Ethics Commissioner adjudicated that because of the real or threatened lawsuit, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> can no longer participate in the debates of this assembly concerning that particular issue.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140334">I think that is wrong. It just ignores parliamentary law. It ignores the Constitution of this country, but having said that, the Ethics Commissioner, in a ruling where she knew she was opening a can of worms, invited Parliament to make the amendment that we are making right now.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140335">I should also say that this rule is not a Canadian rule. It is enjoyed by all Commonwealth countries, including Great Britain, New Zealand, Australia, et cetera. However, we have to consider the ramifications for anyone who wants to argue against this motion, the ramifications to this assembly and the rights enjoyed by the members of Parliament. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140336">If that ruling of the Ethics Commissioner were allowed to stand for any length of time at all, we would all receive these letters of libel, and I have received them and I have written them. They are very easy to prepare. One just writes a letter stating the facts, that one is offended, that one is going to seek damages, general damages, special damages, pecuniary damages, costs, and that an immediate apology is sought.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140337">The letter is generally no more than a page or a page and a half. I would think one could get one done tonight for $50 if one were so inclined, and could have it issued by anyone in the assembly by <?bk?>10 a.m.<?ek?> tomorrow morning.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140338">Once that is done, if we were accept this ruling to its nth degree, that would mean the recipient of that letter could no longer participate in the debates of this assembly concerning that particular issue.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140339">The abuses, if that were allowed to stand, are unimaginable. We could actually shut down debate on any issue by issuing these letters. The manufacturing sector could have a letter on the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>'s desk tomorrow morning complaining about statements that he made, and unfortunately, he would not be able to speak tomorrow about the crisis in our manufacturing sector. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140340">The people who own and operate the tar sands could have a letter of complaint about certain remarks made about our <Affiliation DbId="105835" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation>, and then unfortunately, he would be shut down from participating in any of the debates or deliberations concerning that particular issue, and it goes on and on.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140341">If anyone were to suggest that this is not a very serious issue and suggest that this should not be dealt with immediately, I would submit they are wrong.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="35">(1735)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1140342">A number of academics have spoken to this issue, and I have read at least six or eight columns of their comments. All of the academics unanimously agreed that this decision was either wrong, or, if it was right practically, it should be immediately amended so the rights, as we understand them, are restored so there is no disagreement.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140343">I am not aware of anyone, except certain Conservative members of Parliament, who would disagree with that. I am surprised we are having this debate. I thought the motion would have gone through by consent but we are here today having a debate.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140344">I have sat here for the last two hours listening to the arguments against the motion and most of it boils down to the fact that the Conservatives really do not have any kind of rational or logical argument against the motion, other than to suggest that it requires more debate because it is a serious issue, and I agree. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140345">However, they then make the argument that the last speaker made, that it should be referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. I also agree with that argument but that committee has been basically shut down for the last seven months, like a number of other committees in the House. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140346">What went on in that committee was that the majority of the committee voted to have hearings on the in and out scheme. Obviously, the Conservative members did not want to deal with that so they filibustered. They read books, magazines and transcripts. That went on for seven months so eventually half of the committee was shut down. That would be a situation if it were one committee, but we have a situation where at least four committees are on the very same basis.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140347">Once an issue comes before the committee, it is debated, deliberated and voted upon. If the Conservative leadership in the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>'s office does not want it to go ahead, they filibuster the committee, which is what happened yesterday in what I believe would be the Standing Committee on Government Operations. That is suspended also.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140348">That is what is behind it, which is why it has now come to the House for debate and a vote. I understand that every member of Parliament, except the Conservative members who have been told not to vote for it, will be voting for the motion so that the issue can be resolved as soon as possible.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140349">The argument the Conservatives make on why they do not want to deal with these things when they go before the committee is that they say that it is the tyranny of the majority. I do not understand that. That is how they are in power in a minority government. They are here representing 36% of the people. When a motion goes to committee, it receives the motion, debates it and rules on it but Conservatives will not go along with it, which is why we are in this position. Again, we are talking about three, four or five different committees of the House, which is a very unfortunate circumstance.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140350">The previous speaker made a comment that I found troubling. The member said that the committees of Parliament should defer to the courts or other adjudicative bodies. I have been in the House for eight years now and that is not the way the system operates and it is not the way the system should operate.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140351">I have sat on the public accounts committee when we went through the sponsorship hearings. We certainly were not going wait for a court hearing to go on for seven, eight or nine years to adjudicate. Every last issue involving those is still going on six years after the fact. I would think it will go on for another six years.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140352">If we ever get into the situation where this assembly and the committees of this assembly thought for a minute that they had to wait for every court decision to be concluded, every appeal to be exhausted, every other avenue of application and injunction, we basically would not do anything. It would be so simple for anything to be gutted from the committee. All someone would need to do is make an application to the court. We all know it would be tied up for at least three or four years and nothing would happen in Parliament. I did find that rather troubling. It offends the law of Parliament and the supremacy of Parliament.</ParaText>

Obviously all of us read the decision of the Ethics Commissioner with a great deal of interest and a great deal of concern.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140368"> I want to state for the record that there is a lot of talk on the other side of someone having been found guilty. What the commissioner in fact found was that there was a contravention of the code, as she interpreted it, made in good faith by the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation>, who is a parliamentarian of great standing and goodwill, and that is recognized.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140369">I think all parliamentarians would recognize that there is a problem with making the connection between a “liability”, which arises, according to the judgment of the Ethics Commissioner, of any lawsuit and saying that any lawsuit gives rise to a liability; the mere existence of a lawsuit gives rise to a liability; the liability gives rise to something that is called a private interest; and the private interest then creates the conflict.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140370">With great respect to the Ethics Commissioner, I think that the House itself has to now give real consideration to this. I do not think there is any argument with the efforts that the commissioner has made to be faithful to the code as she has seen it. However, I do have a great deal of difficulty with the notion that any libel suit that is carried out against a member of Parliament for whatever purpose, or with whatever intention in mind, should necessarily have the effect of denying that member the ability to carry on his or her responsibilities as a member of Parliament.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140371">There is a brief reference in the commissioner's judgment to the possibility of a chilling effect but, with great respect to the commissioner, that chilling effect has been somewhat underestimated. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140372">It is important for us to be as precise as we can as well about the exact recommendation that is being made by my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation>, whose interest in these matters is extensive and whose knowledge and interest in questions of the privileges of members of Parliament is quite extensive. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140373">What we are simply asking is that there be an exemption when it comes to the question of a private interest and that exemption would consist of being a party to a legal action relating to actions of the member as a member of Parliament. It is important for the public to understand that if any of us have private businesses and we are sued in the course of those private businesses, that issue that should becomes an issue of concern in terms of declaring what one's private interests are.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140374">However, to assert that because the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation> was sued by the former prime minister of Canada because of comments he allegedly made on the <I>Mike Duffy Live</I> program, in direct connection to the events surrounding the relationship between the former prime minister and Karlheinz Schreiber, which has been a matter of direct interest to all of us and a direct interest to the member for West Nova in his parliamentary responsibilities, and the idea that the very existence of that lawsuit, whatever its foundation may happen to be, should itself prevent the member for West Nova from carrying on his parliamentary responsibilities, he should recuse himself from any votes and recuse himself from any participation in discussions affecting this question of broader public interest, I have some real difficulty with that and, frankly, surprised by the members of the Conservative Party.

							<ParaText id="1140378">I believe that this touches on the responsibilities of members of Parliament and, frankly, touches on the question of how certain powerful interests, which can afford lawyers, lawsuits and to do this, can look at this ruling and say that here is the way to shut down, here is the way to stop so and so from saying anything and here is the way to stop so and so from participating in the debate.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140379">What we are saying in our recommendation, in terms of the amendment to the code, is where lawsuits arise, not from our private activities, or our business activities, or our commercial activities, or anything else we might be doing with our lives, but from the exercise of our responsibilities as members of Parliament, we should not be prevented from participating in the life of Parliament as a result of those lawsuits.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140380">The amendment proposed by my colleague, the member for <Affiliation DbId="78629" Type="2">Scarborough—Rouge River</Affiliation>, is reasonable.

It is a simple fact of life that these things happen.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140382">If we are to do our jobs, it is very hard for us to see how the commissioner's ruling can be maintained as a ruling that will, in a sense, control our daily lives. I think there are charter implications for what the commissioner has said. She is stretching the definition of what a real liability is. Anybody suing somebody, could say now there is a liability, not knowing whether that claim is real, or serious or based in fact.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140383"> It would be wiser for us to say that where we are exercising our duties as members of Parliament, the mere existence of a lawsuit against us as members of Parliament for doing our job as members of Parliament does not create a liability and therefore does not create a conflict.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I was a member of the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics when the code was adopted.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140418">Naturally, those of us who were on the committee at the time never thought this kind of situation would arise, but somebody said “conflict of interest” and a witness who had appeared before the committee launched legal action. One of our colleagues went out for a press conference during which he commented on the testimony, and then he became the subject of legal action.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140419">The lawsuit was not about statements he allegedly made personally; it was about statements a witness made before the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics. That witness was former prime minister Brian Mulroney. He decided to take his defamatory libel suit to the courts.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140420">Who would ever have thought that could happen? It had to be the Conservatives. I realize that they analyzed every flaw in the legislation to find a way to prevent the member from coming back because there was open war between Mr. Mulroney and the member for <Affiliation DbId="78938" Type="2">West Nova</Affiliation>. They discovered that they could ask the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner to intervene because there might have been a conflict of interest with respect to a witness's lawsuit against the member who made the statement.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140421">A lawsuit was filed by a witness, and as a result, the member can no longer speak in committee or in the House of Commons. The member is being sued in his official capacity. He was working on the committee and made a statement outside. It was not personal. It was work-related. This could happen to any of us here in the House of Commons. Any one of us could make a public statement, and a witness who appeared before the committee and was upset about that statement could simply file a lawsuit—guilty verdict optional. </ParaText>

I do not agree with their philosophy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140424">However, this parliamentarian was elected by his constituents, and he has the right to say what he wants in committee and in this House—only not about this matter anymore.

Never in the British parliamentary system has there been a law preventing a member from rising to speak in committee or in the House.

Nevertheless, they are members of this House, they were elected by the people and they have the right to speak in this House on behalf of their constituents, on all matters.</ParaText>

We have to see to it and that is why we have immunity in committee and in the House. Obviously, when we leave the House, this immunity is diminished, even nonexistent. We know all that. The fact remains that, despite the law we have passed, despite the code of ethics we gave ourselves, we have just created a loophole in the existing parliamentary system.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140438">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="78488" Type="2">Gatineau</Affiliation>, a history teacher, told as about the very nice history of the parliamentary system going back to the British North America Act.

Peter Van Loan (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons and Minister for Democratic Reform, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1140470">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate relating to the main estimates for the Senate.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140471">I am glad that the New Democratic Party raised this matter because it draws attention to a very important issue, the need for Senate reform. The government clearly agrees that the Senate cannot stay as it is. Certainly, we understand the sentiment of those who support immediate abolition, as the NDP does and as that party is attempting to achieve through this supply motion, because the Senate is far from the effective institution that it should be. However, the government wishes to take a constructive approach. We support reforming the Senate. Only when it becomes clear that reform is not possible should abolition be pursued, but clearly, the status quo is not acceptable.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140472">Canadians have made it clear that they want change. They no longer have confidence in the Senate as currently instituted and they do not regard it as a legitimate democratic institution appropriate to this millennium. Over the past few years, the consistency in polling results on Senate reform has been quite remarkable. Canadians consistently support either the direct election of senators, or alternatively, that there should be consultations on Senate appointments. For example, an Angus Reid poll just last month indicated that 60% of respondents supported the direct election of senators. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140473">We have listened to Canadians and this government has made it a priority to renew and improve our democratic institutions so that we can have a stronger, better Senate.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140474">A strong and united Canada requires federal parliamentary institutions that reflect democratic values in which Canadians in every region of this country can have confidence and faith.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="1140475">This is why our government has taken concrete action to develop a practical and achievable plan to reform the Senate. Canadians are aware of the difficulties of an in-depth constitutional reform. That is why the government has adopted an incremental approach that will produce immediate results. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140476">In particular, the government has introduced Bill <Document DbId="3095159" Type="3">C-19</Document>, concerning Senate tenure, and Bill <Document DbId="3095164" Type="3">C-20</Document>, which would provide for consultations with the Canadian public concerning appointments to the Senate.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="1140477">Unfortunately, our efforts thus far have been stalled and obstructed in the Senate, demonstrating to Canadians that the Liberals in the Senate refuse to change.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140478">Bill <Document DbId="3095159" Type="3">C-19</Document> to limit the terms of senators to eight years of course was originally introduced in the Senate as Bill S-4. In the Angus Reid poll that I referred to earlier, 64% of respondents indicated they support limiting the terms of senators to eight years. In fact, the <Affiliation DbId="105458" Type="9">Leader of the Opposition</Affiliation> at one time actually supported Senate term limits of only six years. He is on the record supporting those six year term limits.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="1140479">However, even though we knew this strong popular support existed before the Angus Reid survey, and even though the Senate Special Committee on Senate Reform confirmed the constitutionality and goals of the bill, as did numerous constitutional experts, the Senate killed the bill by refusing to allow it to go to third reading, unless it was first referred to the Supreme Court of Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140480">This was definitely an unprecedented move on behalf of the Senate, and I would even go so far as to say that the senators who opposed the bill shirked their responsibilities as parliamentarians. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140481">And it is a perfect example of why Senate reform needs to happen.

							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="1140487">The government's view is that it is utterly unacceptable that in this, the 21st century, and in a federal country such as Canada that prides itself on its democratic values, democratic values that we promote abroad as an example to others, that we have a chamber in our Parliament that lacks fundamental democratic legitimacy. This lack of democratic legitimacy in the Senate impairs its ability to act effectively as a legislative body that plays a meaningful role in the federal parliamentary process.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140488">The Senate consultations bill is a positive step toward correcting this problem. It provides a means for Canadians to have a say in who represents them in what would finally be their Senate.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140489">I find it hard to understand how anyone can disagree with that basic proposition. How can anyone argue that it is okay for a prime minister to consult with friends and family, MPs and party organizers about who should get a good plum spot in the Senate, but not be able to ask Canadian voters for their opinion on who should represent them in their Senate?</ParaText>

However, I still believe it is important that we make every effort to improve this institution before resorting to move forward with abolition. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140493">Therefore, I cannot support the NDP in its efforts at this time to withhold supply to the Senate. Rather, I call upon the NDP to join us in achieving real reform by supporting the government's proposed Senate reform legislation. In other words, let us respond to the desire of Canadians and work toward achieving a modern, democratic Senate. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140494">If the NDP members want to engage in a democratic exercise to abolish the Senate, I invite them to introduce a private member's bill, to hold a referendum and ask Canadians if they want to keep the Senate as it is, to democratize it, or to simply abolish it. That open public debate is the democratically legitimate way to approach abolition, not a back door tactic such as we see tonight through a supply motion.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We have certainly clashed on almost every issue under the sun, although I do not know which hockey team he supports.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140496">However, I think he would agree with me that part of the problem in our dealings with the Senate is it is a group that is defiant, militant and belligerent in its refusal to meet the most basic elements of reform. We have tried many times to drag this group out of the swamps of cronyism and into the 21st century in terms of democratic obligation. Yet it seems continually to refuse the most basic steps forward. Part of the reason for this motion, is to put pressure on it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140497"> We have clear conflict of interest guidelines as members of Parliament. If one is a municipal councillor, one has very clear conflict of interest guidelines. There is transparency and accountability. If one is a school board trustee, as I was in a rural region, there are very clear obligations in terms of pecuniary interest. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140498">Yet senators can sit and participate in a debate when they have financial interest in it. Senators do not have to disclose that.

Senators are allowed to participate in debates where their family members have personal private interests. Most of all, members of Parliament and cabinet ministers must disclose their bank accounts.

Peter Van Loan</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1140501">Mr. Speaker, as I indicated in my comments, I agree with much of what my friend has just said and invite him to take that step, as I said in my address, of putting the question to the Canadian people.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140502">Undoubtedly the issues of conflict of interest and accountability existing in the Senate are ones that concern us. We have a very different set of standards in the House of Commons. We would like to see a similar kind of ethical standards applied in the Senate.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140503">However, it is beyond our reach. It is an appointed body, unaccountable and largely Liberal dominated. Thus far it has resisted those kinds of changes in accountability that we would like to see, although it did not hesitate to get involved in dealing with the Federal Accountability Act.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140504">What is more remarkable is our efforts to reform and change the Senate in some ways face another legislation coming out of the Senate, which seeks to make it harder for that change to happen. Believe it or not, it is a bill being put forward by a senator to make patronage appointments to the Senate mandatory and to compel the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> to make them now. It is hard to believe that exists, but it comes from a Liberal senator, so it is not entirely surprising.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140505"> We have indicated our strong resistance and opposition to that. I hope when it comes over to this chamber, our friends in the New Democratic Party will join us in opposing that measure. It is bad enough we have a Senate chamber that continues to be dominated by a single party, the Liberal Party, which has used it for its own benefit, to reward its activists, its fundraisers, its political campaign organizers, and has resisted any democratic change. However, to make mandatory that further patronage appointments have to be made now would help ensure that further efforts at reform down the road would take that much longer to legitimately democratize the Senate. We want to see it democratized. We want to see it reflect 21st century democratic values.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140506">We would be happy if it represented 20th of 19th century democratic values. The fact is it is an institution more reflective of the 18th century, the time of aristocrats and noblemen. That is not the Canada of today. This is not the democracy of which we are proud, and we want to see that change.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Angus" id="2516419"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78395" Type="2">Mr. Charlie Angus (Timmins—James Bay, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1140507">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise to speak to the motion. The heart of this motion is a cry from parliamentarians for accountability and transparency, as I said in my earlier remarks, for a body that has been defiant in its refusal to be accountable to the Canadian people.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140508">When we talk about democratic reform in the Senate and where to take the upper House, we have to look back at the roots. It is not as if the Senate ever went wrong somewhere along the way. The Senate was founded on fundamentally wrong principles.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140509">If we look back 141 years, when Canada was a fledgling community and it was still very much under the colonial influence of mother England, the belief in England was that commoners could not be allowed to have too much control. There had to be someone of peerage and title above them who could temper the vote of the common people. That belief was similar in Canada at the point the Senate was developed.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140510">The difference in Canada was it did not have a history of the peerage system. It had the swamps of cronyism. The belief then was we had to put in a body that could be chosen from the backrooms of political parties, the hacks, the friends, the pals and the bagmen, to limit the ability of elected members who represented the common people.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140511">One of the great myths and mistruths of what the Senate perpetuates today is that the Senate represents the rights of minorities. John A. Macdonald, as a founding father, said that we needed the Senate to be there for minorities. We will hear this from senators all the time, but they never say the second part of Sir John A. Macdonald's statement. He said, “We need a body to represent the rights of minorities”, because there will always be more poor people than rich people. That is why the Senate was put in place. It was not there to represent minorities as we understand it today. It was to represent the minority view of the rich so there could be a counterbalance to democratic voice.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140512">Ever since then, we have been on the wrong path. The problem with democratic reform of the Senate is we have a body that simply will not allow itself to be reformed. I can understand my colleagues in the Conservative Party. They are certainly making attempts to find a way to reform and work through this Gordian knot of self-interest, but, at the end of the day, I believe the latest attempts will fail like all other attempts have failed. The fact is nobody, in 141 years, has asked the Canadian people what they think.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140513">Many things have changed since 1867 in terms of representation and counterbalance to the weight of Parliament. Provincial governments have much stronger responsibilities. The number one relationship most Canadians have with government would be with their provincial government, not so much the federal government. The relationship between the provincial and federal governments has changed dramatically.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140514">Then there are the courts. When we talk about the role of defending minorities, I have yet to see the Senate play any role. Yet the courts are clearly playing a very strong role as a counterweight to Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140515">We have four levels of government right now. Do we need another level of unaccountable, unelected people who simply refuse to meet the most basic requirements?</ParaText><ParaText id="1140516">So the folks back home will have a bit of a sense of what we are paying for, we are talking about the money we are spending year after year on an unelected, unaccountable group of senators who can sit in the Senate until their 75. Whether they show up or do not show up, whether they work or they do not work, they are there in perpetuity, maybe because some of them flipped pancakes for the Liberal Party for 30 years and were considered perfect people to be sober second thoughts for the democratic voice of the House.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140517">Last year the Senate sat 62 fewer days than the House of Commons. Many senators missed at least a third of a session. Where else can people miss work day after day and still receive a paycheque? In the Senate. Senators do not have to worry about constituencies. When MPs are not in Parliament, they have to go back to meet their constituents and work for them. Senators do not have to do that.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140518">That is nothing to disparage. There are very good senators and less good senators. but the difference is, at the end of the day, members of Parliament, whether lazy, brilliant, good or bad, have to go back to their people. They have to get the seal of approval from the people, and some great members of Parliament have lost their seats over the years. Senators do not have to do that.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="45">(1845)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1140519">Since 1993, the gross pay of senators has increased 70%. Senators get paid for working 30% fewer days than members of Parliament. Senators are allowed to miss 21 days without a penalty and this does not include the times that they are out working for the party during elections.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140520">In my riding we talk about the senator is there for regional interests. I have the great Frank Mahovlich, I say great because he was number 27 and from Schumacher. The only times I get to see Frank in my riding is during elections, when he comes up to try to have me defeated. I do not know if he is on the Senate dime or not. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140521">I will not mention the former Montreal Canadien who the Liberals brought up as well to have me defeated. The press asked me why, in the middle of elections, the Liberals were bringing up hockey players. I said that whenever their campaign started to go south, they were clearly had to rely on hockey players. I said that if the press ever saw them bringing Kenny "The Rat" Linseman into Timmins—James Bay in the middle of an election, it would know I was in trouble. I expect the next time I will see Frank is probably in the next election.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140522">However, this is the big issue and this is where we have to be serious. Senators have phenomenal conflict of interest guidelines that allow them latitudes that would never be allowed even at the lowest municipal level or school board level. For example, they can sit as the heads of a board of directors of major corporations and still vote on issues in which they have a pecuniary interest. This is simply appalling in the 21st century. It is not accountability.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140523">Senators are sitting on the boards of income trusts and telecommunication companies, where these issues are being debated and being brought forward to the Senate. This is not the kind of democracy and accountability that Canadians expect. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140524">There is a whole list of senators, such as the hon. Michael Meighen who sits as a director and trustee on 25 different companies and trusts. He still gets paid, he still comes in and he is supposed to discharge the business of the country. That is perfectly okay when people are senators because they do not have to disclose their financial interests. They can participate in closed camera sessions, as senators, and as long as they tell their pals in the Senate that they have a pecuniary interest, they can participate in the vote.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140525">As I said earlier, I was a rural school board trustee and we were not allowed to discuss any contract that had to do with hiring or firing of anyone, whether it was custodial or teachers, at a school board in Ontario. If any of us had a relative anywhere in the province of Ontario working in any school board in any capacity, we were not even allowed to talk about the contracts. These are the rules in place for small town school board trustees, yet senators sit on private health consortiums and talk about the future of health care. Whenever the Liberal Party gets whatever private member's bill on income trusts through the House, we will have senators who represent income trusts voting on that.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140526">I do not think that passes the smell test for accountability and transparency in the 21st century. Therefore, we have a real problem. We have a body that simply refuses to reform itself.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140527"> Our colleagues in the Conservative Party would like to find other ways to do it, but we all have to deal with the fact that we have a very large mountain that is so high we cannot get over it, it is so low we cannot get under it and it is so wide we cannot get around it. It is the constitutional limitations on our ability to actually reform that.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140528">The response of the New Democratic Party is quite simple. After 141 years of cronyism and patronage, we say put the question to the Canadian people. Why not let the Canadian people say what they think should be the future? That would certainly guide provincial leaders, if we saw a clear movement to say we have had enough of this, we do not need this in a 21st century democracy. I think it would actually impel our provincial leaders to come together and then move forward to the real steps of reform. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140529">As much as I understand where the Conservatives are coming from on trying to reform this bunch, at the end of the day, we will end up in court. At the end of the day, we will have a Senate simply refusing to grow up and take responsibility as accountable citizens. The reality is they are not accountable because they are appointed. Always at the end of the day, they are friends of the party. In the 21st century we have to move toward a better standard of democratic involvement.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The NDP, if it is as true to its convictions as it pretends to be, ought to open every session of Parliament with a private member's bill, a motion, or, perhaps with their new bed fellows often the government, a bill which calls for the abolition of the Senate.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140545">It is one thing to say that we are continuously and regularly against the abolition of the Senate, but it is another thing to walk the walk and not just talk the talk. The NDP should in fact bring a vote for abolition, but it does not do that. It does this tonight, ladies and gentlemen of the public might want to know, it does it on a supply day.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140546">The NDP members say that it is almost like the baby is coming, but we are not going to buy a crib for the baby. What they are really saying is that they will not fund the Senate, but they did not have the guts, it was not on their agenda. I am not accusing the member for <Affiliation DbId="78395" Type="2">Timmins—James Bay</Affiliation> of not having guts or not making it his continual priority, but maybe he cannot get through to the leader to make it a priority to abolish the Senate. Maybe that is the case.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140547">However, the fact is that we are standing here tonight discussing whether all of the departments of government should be funded, and the funding in question in this motion is the Senate, whether the Senate should be funded. If it is not funded, it dies. It cannot function.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140548">That is a little sneaky. The real big sneak though is the government. The <Affiliation DbId="105837" Type="4">Minister for Democratic Reform</Affiliation>, through his prepared text, would have Canadians believe that his party's sensible piecemeal approach, Bill <Document DbId="3095159" Type="3">C-19</Document> and Bill <Document DbId="3095164" Type="3">C-20</Document>, of various ways to reform the Senate, are as a result of their consultation with the people of Canada and that is what the people want.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140549">I do not know about that. If we want to talk about what the people want by virtue of polling, which is what he referred to, then really what we are talking about is the disrespect that Canadians now have in the honesty of the government. The government is falling in its credibility and honesty.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140550">I think they will see that what the government is trying to do is to appease parts of Canada, and particularly western Canada that has in fact been underrepresented in the Senate of Canada since its inception and since the joining of provinces into Confederation, by promising them and their leaders in provincial capitals and movements like western think tanks and that sort of thing, promising them gradual reform but as an end game hoping that the gradual reforms do not work.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140551"> Then the end game for the Conservatives and the <Affiliation DbId="105837" Type="4">Minister for Democratic Reform</Affiliation> is to do one of two things, I suppose, do what I think a vast majority of his caucus wants him to do, which is to join with the NDP and abolish the Senate. That would centralize the power of the governing party in the one house, the unicameral house.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140552">There are very few unicameral houses in western democracies. Most evolved western democracies have bicameral systems, two houses: the congress and the senate, the senate and the people's house. That is generally the way these things work. So, he would be alone on that one but maybe that is what the government House leader wants. Maybe, however, he wants to fill the Senate with the people that he wants.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="00">(1900)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1140553">He said earlier that the only reason the vacancies have not been filled is because the government did not want to make patronage appointments. I do not know if that is an admission that Michael Fortier, the current senator, was in fact a patronage appointment. We heard some backtalk that it was necessary because we needed a minister from Montreal and he would run at the next available opportunity.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140554">I do miss some press stories, but I have not seen Michael Fortier, the senator, run in any byelection in Quebec that was called recently. I think he is probably not going to present himself in a byelection and, therefore, the government's ruse in saying that it had to appoint someone to have representation really was false, as well.</ParaText>

That is because, despite the fact that a couple of eminent professors support, in the case of Bill <Document DbId="3095164" Type="3">C-20</Document>, Senate reform with respect to the election or selection of senators, the vast majority of academics have come out and said they are against Bill <Document DbId="3095164" Type="3">C-20</Document>, the bill that says provinces can select names that the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> can choose or not. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140556">The vast majority of provinces, through their attorneys general, have been against the bill. It goes to the fundamental point, and it would have been a good question had I had the opportunity to ask it of the <Affiliation DbId="105837" Type="4">Minister for Democratic Reform</Affiliation>, of whether the real public consultation that he seeks with the Canadians would be done in focus groups and hotel rooms in predominantly Conservative ridings? Or is he afraid of consulting with the provinces?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140557"> Provincial governments, and maybe the <Affiliation DbId="105837" Type="4">Minister for Democratic Reform</Affiliation> did not know that, by some of his rhetoric inside and outside the House, I am not sure he does, are elected. Premiers, MLAs and MPPs are elected by the people of the provinces and they represent those provinces.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140558">However, the <Affiliation DbId="105837" Type="4">Minister for Democratic Reform</Affiliation> has serially called a number of them into question, that is, the premiers of the provinces. He has called the premier of Ontario, I think, the small man of Confederation. These kind of epithets are not really conducive to sitting down with premiers, which his government has not done yet. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140559">The government gave a nice meal of venison and, I think, apple pie or cloudberry pie at Sussex Drive around Christmas, but it has not sat down with provincial premiers to discuss the idea of constitutional reform, which has been very much part of our Canadian history for some time.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140560"> I do not know if the member for <Affiliation DbId="120535" Type="2">Toronto Centre</Affiliation> can recall any of these times, but even in the best of times, provincial leaders and prime ministers and their federal counterpart ministers had disagreements. So, if the Conservative government is afraid of disagreement, which clearly by the way the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> runs his caucus, it is, then that is fine. Why does he not come clean with the Canadian people, why does not the <Affiliation DbId="105837" Type="4">Minister for Democratic Reform</Affiliation> come clean with the people and say, “Well, we're just not meeting with any provincial governments because we think there might be disagreement?” </ParaText><ParaText id="1140561">I think the <Affiliation DbId="105837" Type="4">Minister for Democratic Reform</Affiliation> has seen through the hearings we had on Bill <Document DbId="3095164" Type="3">C-20</Document>. We had Bênoit Pelletier, the minister for Canadian intergovernmental affairs of Quebec recently before the committee. I think he has seen that there is profound disagreement with the way the federal government is proceeding with Senate reform. He knows that in my own province of New Brunswick, Premier Shawn Graham, who is responsible for intergovernmental affairs, is against the procedure. Even what he thought were erstwhile allies in the west, they have said, “Well, we don't agree with the part of Bill <Document DbId="3095164" Type="3">C-20</Document> that says that the election modality should be federal. It should be provincial.”</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140562">The Conservatives cannot even get their allies onside. They do not want these bills to pass. They are not genuine about Senate reform. I think in lieu of this supply item, the best they can do is hide their tails and oppose it.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Paquette" id="2516444"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="78635" Type="2">Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1140578">Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Québécois will support the NDP in contesting the vote for the Senate, for reasons that are perhaps not the same, but I am sure they are similar in some respects.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140579">The first reason is that, like the NDP and many Canadians and Quebeckers, we think the Senate is an antiquated institution. In particular, the fact that the representatives are not elected means that the institution's legitimacy is by no means assured. Furthermore, all of the provinces got rid of this second unelected chamber a long time ago. It is obviously a legacy left over from a time when aristocrats, the elite, were afraid of the democratic decisions of the people, and created the Senate to act as a sort of counterbalance. The Queen of England and Canada appointed people back then. The Prime Minister has since taken over that responsibility. We know that officially, it is the Governor General who appoints Senators, after hearing the Prime Minister's recommendation. Thus, it is an antiquated institution.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140580">It is also, and this is where we differ from the NDP and other Canadians, an institution that was part of Confederation in 1867. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140581">In 1867, it was decided that the House of Commons would proportionally represent—although it was not entirely equitable—the population of each of the Canadian provinces and that the Senate would be a counterbalance—once again, not elected, unfortunately—to represent different regions in Canada: the Atlantic provinces, Quebec, Ontario and the West. This means that abolishing the Senate would require us to reopen constitutional negotiations and reconsider the question of representation of the Quebec nation within federal institutions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140582">Yesterday, Benoît Pelletier testified before the legislative committee examining Bill <Document DbId="3095164" Type="3">C-20</Document>. He said that Quebec has traditionally asked to appoint its own senators using its own democratic selection process. He certainly disagreed with the fact that it is the Prime Minister of Canada who chooses the senators who will represent Quebec. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140583">What we now have is an institution that no longer has a raison d'être, but that, in the Confederation agreement of 1867, represented a counterbalance to Canada's changing demographics. In that respect, clearly, while we in no way approve of the Senate as an institution, we would like to remind the House that its abolition would force renewed constitutional negotiations to give the Quebec nation a presence and significant authority within the federal institutions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140584">I will not hide the fact that my preference would be for Quebec to escape from the shackles of Canada and have its own democratic institutions. We can now very easily imagine the National Assembly being complemented by a house of the regions. All possible scenarios are being studied at this time within the sovereignist movement. But until sovereignty is achieved, the people can be assured—and the Bloc Québécois has made this its first priority—that the interests of the Quebec nation will be met.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140585">I know the Conservative government has made a threat in that respect. It has said that if the recommended changes to the Senate are not accepted, it would abolish the Senate. It is not that simple, as we all know, and as I just pointed out. Negotiations could be held, however, under the rules set out in the Canadian Constitution. As I have often said, and yesterday I reminded Benoît Pelletier, Quebec's minister of intergovernmental affairs—who was appearing before the legislative committee—that we are the only ones, that is, Quebec and the Bloc Québécois are the only ones trying to ensure respect for the Constitution of 1867 in this House.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="15">(1915)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1140586">It must be ensured that the results of these negotiations respect the political weight of the Quebec nation, as they will entail the enforcement of rules from amendments in the 1982 Constitution—that is, seven provinces representing 50% of the population. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140587">Quebec has made its opinion known. We want 24% of the members of this House to come from Quebec, no matter the distribution of seats. For example, we are currently studying Bill <Document DbId="3095148" Type="3">C-22</Document>, which would increase the number of seats in Ontario and two western provinces. This increase, which is completely legitimate in light of demographic changes, will diminish the relative political weight of the Quebec nation. We find that unacceptable. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140588">The Quebec nation must maintain 24% of the political weight in this House as long as Quebeckers decide to stay within the Canadian political landscape. I have no problem with increasing the number of seats in the west or in Ontario to reflect demographics. But I do not agree with marginalizing Quebec through that increase. I am not the only one to say so. The Bloc Québécois has said it, and the National Assembly unanimously passed a motion in this regard.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140589">That leads me to the second reason why we support the NDP's opposition to the vote regarding the Senate, namely the manner in which the Conservative government, the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and especially the Leader of the Government are going about their so-called reform, which does not alter the main characteristics of the current Senate with Bills <Document DbId="3095164" Type="3">C-20</Document> and <Document DbId="3095159" Type="3">C-19</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140590">They are trying to do indirectly what cannot be done directly. However, no one is being fooled. I would say that 80% of the constitutional experts who appeared before the committee—and I can assure him that there were not many sovereigntists among them—told us that the government's bills touched on the essential characteristics of the Senate and would require the reopening of the Constitution. Negotiations would require the application of the rules for making amendments set out in the Constitution Act, 1982, namely approval by seven provinces and 50% of the population.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140591">The Conservative government wants to avoid that scenario and would like to present Quebec and Canada with a fait accompli. We will oppose this way of proceeding, as did the National Assembly. If the federal government wants to reopen constitutional negotiations to reform the Senate, Quebec will be there with the demands of successive Quebec governments. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140592">If that happens, we will also raise the issue of the federal spending power. It is clear that the Conservative government does not really have the political will to get rid of that power. It is very clear that if Senate reform negotiations take place, Quebec will not only ensure that the Quebec nation's interests are protected, but also take on certain other irritants that are not working for Quebec, issues that the federal government refuses to address. These issues include the elimination of the federal spending power in areas under Quebec's and the provinces' jurisdiction.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140593">The only way to be absolutely sure that the federal government will not encroach on Quebec's areas of jurisdiction is to ensure that Quebec and other provinces that want it have the right to opt out with no strings attached and with full compensation. So we say yes to reopening constitutional talks on Senate reform, but the government can expect Quebec to bring other things to the table: all of the demands of successive Quebec governments, both the sovereignist and the federalist ones.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140594">That is what Mr. Pelletier said yesterday, and I will end on that note. The Conservative government's current plan for Senate reform is unconstitutional, it is against the Quebec nation's interests, and it is against the motions that were repeatedly and unanimously adopted by the National Assembly, most recently in May 2007. It is clear that this government's support for the motion that was passed almost unanimously in the House concerning recognition of the Quebec nation was nothing but an election ploy. Quebeckers have now realized that and condemned it. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We saw it a number of times in the period from 2004 to 2006 when the unelected Senate, in protecting big financial interests, thwarted legislation that was designed to protect wage earners in this country where their employers went bankrupt or into receivership and where priority was given not to the labour side of the equation but all priorities were given to the capital side.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140600">We saw repeatedly that legislation was stalled, oftentimes by Liberal Senators, so that it would expire in the course of the upcoming election. Other times legislation was amended, or it simply sat there literally for a year, or a year and a half in one case.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140601">That is simply not tolerable in a country that prides itself on being a democratic country, one that is a beacon for democracy in the world and one with every right to be proud of that reputation, but for this blight that we have in the other chamber.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140602">I saw it very personally and it was so offensive, the work that a cadre within the Senate did to prevent the passage of legislation to protect animals in this country. It did it repeatedly. Not once but on three different occasions the Senate has been able to manipulate the constitutional framework of this country to the benefit of a very small segment of people that it wanted to take care of. The end result is that there have not been amendments in the animal cruelty area for well over 100 years, in spite of passage of bills in this House on two separate occasions. It was the Senate that prevented that.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140603">I looked at some of the letters and petitions that came into my office from across the country. There were two things that showed up. One was outrage that it has taken our level of government this long to deal with the issue. The other thing that showed up was a combination of shock and sadness that after all this time an unelected Senate, an unelected body, an unresponsive body to the needs of the country could thwart the votes in this House, could thwart the desire right across the country of the need for this legislation to go through.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140604">As I said earlier, there are any number of other pieces of legislation we can look to. Inevitably when we look at legislation that has been stalled, it has always been stalled, stopped or prevented from going ahead in the Senate because members in the other place were taking care of their buddies, always, every single time. It has never been done on principle. it has never been done on ideology. It is all about whom they are going to take care of. It is always their friends.

This left French-language singers without a chance to showcase their talent.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140802">The gala was three hours and fifteen minutes long, and all of the French-language singers were cut for reasons that border on xenophobia. “Anglophones will change the channel if the francophones sing.”</ParaText><ParaText id="1140803">It is despicable. And it has been this way for three years. It is unacceptable. Conservative, Liberal, New Democrat and Bloc members do not approve of this state of affairs. This is what we told Mr. Stursberg and his boss, Hubert Lacroix, the president of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, on May 27 when he appeared before the Standing Committee on Official Languages.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140804">What if Inuit singers Kashtin were to perform? Would the CBC go off air so as not to displease people who do not speak their language? You have to wonder. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140805">Mr. Stursberg claimed that audience ratings studies supported his decision. That is out of order. Quebeckers, Acadians and Brayons, together with francophones in Newfoundland, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia, Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut, not to mention francophile anglophones, all pay their taxes to the federal government, and some of that money goes to the CBC. They all have the right to hear francophone singers on the CBC, particularly during its broadcast of the hall of fame gala honouring Canadian songwriters from coast to coast. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140806">There is every reason for members of the House of Commons to get involved in issues related to the crown corporation's programming. We were elected by citizens who want us to represent them and who want us to spend their tax money well. In this case, they want us to make sure that public television programming reflects their Quebec culture or their Canadian culture, as the case may be.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140807">According to Canada's broadcasting policy, the crown corporation, which includes both the Société Radio-Canada and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, must “reflect Canada”.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140808">For the past three years, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation has failed to comply with that important part of its mandate during CBC broadcasts of the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame gala featuring both francophone and anglophone songwriters. That has to change.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Jim Abbott (Parliamentary Secretary for Canadian Heritage, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1140809">Mr. Speaker, despite challenges of geography, language and proximity to the largest cultural exporter in the world, Canada has built a broadcasting system that works. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140810">In fact, the Canadian broadcasting system stands alone as one of the great achievements of our nation. The government remains committed to a single broadcasting system comprised of public, private and community elements.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140811">It is a system that operates in both French and English and serves official language minority communities. Since it was first established in 1936, CBC Radio-Canada has been a core institution and a unique component of the Canadian broadcasting system. Canadians have traditionally turned to their national public broadcaster as a source for news, information and entertainment.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140812">The mandate of CBC Radio-Canada is contained in the Broadcasting Act. Its objectives present a broad mandate and challenge our national public broadcaster to produce programming that reflects Canadians across the country. The act stipulates that CBC Radio-Canada's programming is expected to actively contribute to the flow and exchange of cultural expression. </ParaText><ParaText id="1140813">According to the act, programming offered by CBC Radio-Canada is expected to be in English and French, reflecting the different needs and circumstances of each official language community, including the particular needs and circumstances of English and French linguistic minorities.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140814">Furthermore, CBC Radio-Canada's programming should “strive to be of equivalent quality in English and in French”. As a national public broadcaster, CBC Radio-Canada should reflect all the population it serves and offer something for all Canadians. Therefore, in March 2007, the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage launched a full investigation of the role for a public broadcaster in the 21st century.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140815">As part of its proceedings the committee heard from a wide range of witnesses. The committee also travelled to Whitehorse, Vancouver, Winnipeg, Toronto, St. John's and Montreal.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140816">Tabled in February 2008, the report confirmed the importance of the national public broadcaster, stating that the committee regards CBC Radio-Canada as an essential public institution that plays a crucial role in bringing Canadians together.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140817">The committee also made a recommendation to stress how important it is for CBC Radio-Canada to continue to contribute to shared national consciousness and identity as stipulated in subparagraph 3(1)(m)(vi) of the Broadcasting Act. The committee acknowledged the English language and French language television services face different challenges as a result of their respective situations, their needs and the characteristics of their audiences.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1140818">The committee considered that CBC Radio-Canada's role of building bridges and fostering mutual understanding among Canadians to be essential. The committee added that CBC Radio-Canada is a major national public institution and is supported by all Canadians. Canadians have the right to expect the corporation to tell them more about themselves and what is going on around the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140819">I wish to thank the members of the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage for their work. Having been one of them, I know that we worked hard on this highly important issue and I look forward to the continued cooperation among the committee members on issues like this.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I have already made the point to the president and vice-president of the crown corporation that when a gala such as the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame gala, featuring French and English songwriters from Quebec and Canada, is broadcast, at least one quarter of the program must be in French. This is imperative. People whose language of use is French represent 25% of Canada's population, and they are entitled to hear francophone singers during such a gala.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140821">This requirement should be included in all CBC and Radio-Canada contracts for galas similar to the one we are talking about today.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

According to the Broadcasting Act, CBC Radio-Canada is an autonomous crown corporation responsible for the management of its own day to day operations, including programming independence.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140823">It is CBC Radio-Canada's board of directors and senior management who are responsible and accountable for programming decisions. In May, CBC President Lacroix appeared before both the official languages and the Canadian heritage committees where he assured committee members that these events have raised CBC's level of awareness on these issues and that the CBC will do a better job on these kinds of broadcasts in the future.</ParaText><ParaText id="1140824">He also wrote an open letter for the April 23 edition of <I>La Presse</I> in which he stressed that building bridges between anglophone and francophone communities was obviously a priority for our public broadcaster's mandate.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
