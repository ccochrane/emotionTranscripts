Given that the CSIOs are responsible for the planning, coordination, and administration of CSC’s community security intelligence program, CSIOs continue to act as the primary point of contact for police agencies and other partners concerning intelligence-related issues. 
Furthermore, the preventive security and intelligence program continues to provide decision-makers with reliable and timely intelligence and information on potential threats within the offender population. Since the conclusion of the IPPI, CSC has continued to productively engage with law enforcement on community intelligence issues, the recapture of offenders who have gone unlawfully at large, and offender release planning through effective information sharing and consultation in order to deliver the best possible public safety results for Canadians.

						</PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4237648"> moved that Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6, an act to amend the Citizenship Act and to make consequential amendments to another Act</Document>, be read the second time and referred to a committee.</ParaText><ProceduralText TocType="TPC" id="10">Bill C-6. Second reading</ProceduralText><ParaText id="4237649"> He said: Mr. Speaker, it is an honour and a pleasure for me to rise to speak to Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document>, which is an act to make major amendments to the previous government's Citizenship Act, better known in some circles as the noxious Bill <Document DbId="6401990" Type="3">C-24.</Document></ParaText><ParaText id="4237650">We are making these major changes for two general reasons: one, we promised to do that in our election platform and in my mandate letter; and two, the acts that we are carrying out in this new law are consistent with what we promised to do. </ParaText><ParaText id="4237651">From the government's point of view and my point of view, we are doing what we said we would do. What is more important is why we want to do this. On this side, I would say there are two basic principles at stake.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4237652">That is unacceptable to us. There should be only one class of Canadians, not two. That is the first principle.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237653">As far as the second principle is concerned, we want to welcome new citizens to Canada. The Conservative legislation put up a number of roadblocks that we believe made it unreasonably harder for permanent residents to become Canadian.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4237654">Therefore, there are two points of principle. First, there must be one class of Canadian, not two. Second, we want to welcome new citizens. We believe the Conservatives erected a number of barriers that were unreasonable to the welcoming of new people to become citizens of our country.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237655">Let me go through each of these general areas one at a time. </ParaText><ParaText id="4237656">In the previous Conservative bill, the minister of citizenship and immigration had the authority to revoke an individual citizenship if that person was convicted of a terrorist crime or some other crime. However, and this is a crucial point, the minister only had the power to revoke citizenship if the person involved was a dual citizen, not if the person was a citizen only of Canada. Similarly, the Federal Court had the right to revoke citizenship in other cases, but again only for dual citizens. </ParaText><ParaText id="4237657">This is the nub of the point because once we say we can revoke one type of Canadian citizenship but cannot revoke another, then we have two classes of Canadians. We believe very strongly, and we fought long and hard during the election on this issue, that there is only one class of Canadian, a Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian. All Canadians are equal and there cannot be two classes of Canadians, which is why we found this law unacceptable and why the new law would revoke that right to revoke citizenship. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4237658">We have said it for many months with the conviction of our beliefs, and once the law passes, we can also say it in the spirit of the law. It will say there is only one class of Canadian, not two. </ParaText><ParaText id="4237659">In fact, we believe this so strongly that we are going to reinstate the citizenship of the one individual who had his citizenship revoked for reasons of terrorism. That individual, according to the new law, will have his citizenship reinstated. </ParaText><ParaText id="4237660">It is a point of principle. When we say a Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian, that includes good and bad Canadians. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="05">(1605)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4237661">The bad Canadians who are convicted for terrorism should go to prison. If there are bad terrorists, they should go to prison for a long time, although it is the judges, not the politicians, who determine the sentences. The place for a terrorist is in prison, not at the airport. It is our strong belief that if a person is sent to prison for terrorism, there should not be two classes of terrorists: those who go to prison and have their citizenship revoked and those who only go to prison. A Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian, for a terrorist and for others, and therefore in our view we will not have any citizenship revoked for this reason.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237662">I would also make the supplementary argument that to revoke citizenship in this way is to launch oneself on a slippery slope, because the rules might be clear today about for what crime we have citizenship revoked and for what crime do we not, but those laws can change over time. I remember the former prime minister in the election campaign speculating about additional crimes that might be added. Who knows? It might be terrorism one year, and something else—whatever catches the attention of the government of the day—could be added the next year. It is a slippery slope, and one does not know where on that slope one will end up.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4237663"> The definition of what constitutes dual citizenship is also a slippery slope. I am not a lawyer, but I know legal minds have debated the issue of who is a dual citizen and who is not. Some individuals might be born in Canada, have never been to some second country, but are nevertheless dual citizens of that country because of the laws of that country. Some people have claimed that Jews are dual citizens in a sense, because they have the right to live in Israel. Does that make them dual citizens of Canada and Israel? Under the previous law, that might have been a question that went before the courts. </ParaText><ParaText id="4237664">Our view is that we should just terminate this slippery slope. We should abolish 100% the practice of revoking citizenship for any kind of terrorism or other crime. The debate would therefore be moot. It would not matter who is a dual citizen and who is not, or which crimes are included, because under no circumstances would a person have his or her citizenship revoked for these reasons. These other secondary, slippery-slope arguments would simply not arise.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4237665">The last point I would make on this issue is that there is one reason that is still the case for individuals to have their citizenship revoked, and that has always been on the books, and that is if individuals misrepresent who they are when they become citizens. In that situation that would imply that the individuals do not deserve to be citizens because they gave false information in order to become citizens. If that is the case, then their citizenship can be revoked. That has been the case in Canada since 1947, and that will remain the case.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237666">There is one thing I might mention that the parliamentary committee may wish to consider. After we came out with our law, certain legal individuals said that, when a person has his or her citizenship revoked for this one remaining reason that is allowed, that person may or may not have sufficient right to appeal. If after listening to witnesses, the committee agrees that there is insufficient right to appeal such a decision, then the government and I would certainly be prepared to contemplate such an amendment to our bill. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4237667">This makes a more general point, unlike the previous government; but allow me to just talk for this government. We are certainly open to amendments, if there are amendments from either the Liberal side or the opposition side that would improve the bill. We do not claim perfection. If some members on the committee, of any party, have ideas for how to improve it, we would be open to such suggestions. </ParaText><ParaText id="4237668">I just mentioned this one as a case in point: I heard in the debate following the introduction of the bill that there may not be an adequate right to appeal in the case of citizenship revocation flowing from providing false information.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="10">(1610)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4237669">That covers my first general point about citizenship revocation. The second area concerns barriers that we think in some cases are unnecessary or inappropriate barriers to citizenship, and there are four areas where we will change the previous bill, in some cases, substantially.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4237670">I can read the four items that we are going to change.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237671">First, the 2015 measures required anyone applying to become a Canadian citizen to declare their intent to live in Canada once citizenship was obtained. We are going to get rid of that. </ParaText><ParaText id="4237672">The measures also prolonged the residency requirement for applicants, requiring them to stay in Canada for a much longer period before being able to apply for citizenship. We are also going to change that, as I will explain.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237673">They also eliminated the possibility of applying half of the time applicants spent in Canada before becoming permanent residents in the calculation of the duration of their physical presence here. This affects international students.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237674">Finally, as for the fourth item, the measures required applicants 14 to 64 to meet language and knowledge criteria. Previously, only applicants 18 to 54 had to meet those criteria. We are going to reinstate the previous age requirement, 18 to 54.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4237675">Let me quickly go through each of these in turn. The first point concerns the intention to reside, that people have to declare before they become a citizen that they intend to reside in Canada. Some people in the legal profession were concerned that it could then become a reason to revoke citizenship. Let us say people stated an intent to reside in Canada, and let us say they were telling the truth, then their company shifted them to New York or whatever and the circumstances changed. It was feared that, having invoked this intent to reside, they could subsequently be challenged if their plans changed. The simplest way to deal with that is to get rid of that provision, which is what we are doing. We are repealing it. We think that was a legitimate concern, and we do not think there is merit to retaining that element of the bill.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4237676">The second part is the physical presence requirement. We believe that people should be required to be physically present in Canada for a certain length of time. We believe there is significant citizenship fraud or citizens of convenience, so we do want to continue to attack that. We do not dispute the principle of having a certain length of time in which people have to be physically present in Canada, but we are bringing it back to where it was, or at least changing it from what the Conservatives had, that they have to be physically present in Canada for four out of the past six years. We are moving to three out of the past five years, which is somewhat more flexible and also allows citizenship applicants to become citizens one year earlier than was the case under the previous bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237677">The third item is one where I feel there is a particular lack of intelligence in the previous bill. If we look at international students, we see they are one of the most fertile grounds for new Canadians. We have an aging population. We really need more immigrants, and who better than international students, in the sense that by definition they are educated, by definition they know something about Canada, and almost by definition they can speak English or French? What better group to solicit to become Canadians than international students?</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="15">(1615)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4237678">Why then do we sort of punch them in the nose, instead of courting them, by taking away the entitlement they previously had that 50% of the time they had spent in Canada as international students would count toward becoming citizens? I think they have clearly earned that entitlement by being here, learning about Canada, and so on. Therefore, I do not see why that entitlement should be removed, and indeed, in this bill, we are restoring it.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237679">Someone asked me why not 100%, and we can have that debate. I think 50% might be a good number, but certainly not zero. I think we should go back to where it was, 50%.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237680">Finally, this is a simple point on language. Again, we agree in principle that knowing English or French is really important, and we are not abolishing that requirement at all. Research has shown that knowledge of one or more of the official languages helps to predict an individual's success in this country, economically and job-wise. Therefore, we are not eliminating that, but we are restoring the age range to where it was, which is the age of 18 to 54, rather than 14 to 64.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4237681">In sum, we disagree with the Conservative government's legislation based on two general principles. First, a Canadian is a Canadian. All Canadians are equal. We must not have two classes of citizens. Second, we want to welcome newcomers as Canadians, and we do not want the conditions for becoming Canadian to be too rigid or too difficult.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="4237682">In summary, it is for those reasons that I am pleased to present to the House our proposals in Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document>.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Michelle Rempel (Calgary Nose Hill, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4237683">Mr. Speaker, certainly some of the proposals in the bill may lead to changes, or increases in the workload for visa officers and immigration officers who are processing other lines of business outside of the refugee stream. </ParaText><ParaText id="4237684">I noticed in question 19, which was tabled by the parliamentary secretary earlier today, that 220 employees, if I read this correctly, have been temporarily assigned to processing Syrian refugee applications from the central processing region. If I am correct, the types of business lines that are impacted there include the processing of spousal sponsorship applications. I wonder if my colleague could tell the House how the transferring of 220 employees affected other business lines during the processing of the Syrian refugee initiative. This was up until December 15 of last year. </ParaText><ParaText id="4237685">I note that in the response to the question, it also says that other employees were transferred around. If they are transferring employees from other business lines, given they might not be trained on certain activities or whatnot, might that impact the processing times for things like spousal sponsorship? Could the minister explain how the department has been impacted in that regard?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

John McCallum</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4237686">Mr. Speaker, I can say that I certainly make no apology for some employees being transferred around to expedite the Syrian refugee operation. It was a big commitment that we made and a big priority, and I think Canadians have come to support this initiative. Indeed, even the official opposition has supported our Syrian refugee initiative. It was a high priority.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237687">The way in which we will address processing times for families, as we said during the election, is to, one, commit more resources and hire more individuals to interview people, and two, learn from the experience of Syrian refugees.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237688">One definition of real change is to do something one has never done before. The public servants in my department have never processed refugees as quickly and efficiently as they did. Therefore, we will learn from the lessons they learned in expediting refugee processing. We will also learn from that how to move much faster on the processing of spouses and other family members. </ParaText><ParaText id="4237689">We will achieve our objectives on processing times, first by providing more resources, but at least as important, by learning from our experience on the Syrian refugees and importing that experience to make processes for families way more efficient and rapid than they have been in the past.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Kwan" id="8828166"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="214258" Type="2">Ms. Jenny Kwan (Vancouver East, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4237690">Mr. Speaker, the minister talked about the language issue. There is no question in my mind that speaking some English and French is an important component to this process. With that being said, when many immigrants come here, the question becomes the level of proficiency in the language that would need to be examined.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237691">Under the current system, they people send in results of an accepted third-party test at the equivalent of a Canadian language benchmark level 4 or higher in speaking or listening, or provide proof of completion of a secondary or post-secondary program conducted in French or English. If they do not send those documents to prove they have met this requirement, their application for citizenship will not be accepted.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237692">I know of many people who are not at that level, but they contribute greatly economically. They pay their taxes, they raise their families, and they participate in their community. If we do not remove these barriers, I am afraid it will prevent them from becoming citizens and, ultimately, engaging fully in a democratic society, which is having the right to vote.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237693">Further, the other piece related to barriers to citizenship is the application fees and the high costs of those.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4237694">Under the Conservative government, the fees went up, from $100 to $530, for an adult, with an additional $100 for a child. Therefore, that also poses financial barriers for people to access the pathway to citizenship. </ParaText><ParaText id="4237695">Would the minister agree with me that both of those items need to be addressed and will he take action in that regard?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. McCallum" id="8828179"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="214309" Type="4">Hon. John McCallum</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="4237696">Mr. Speaker, I do agree that both of those are very legitimate questions.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237697">On the point about the fees, we made no commitment to reduce the fees. It is something we will examine going forward, but this is not in this legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237698">On the question of the language, there are two issues. There is the age at which the test is applied and the level of the test.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237699">What we have amended in the bill is the age. While I think the hon. member and I both agree that language is important, traditionally in Canada some older people would arrive without the best English in the world and it would improve over time. However, their children, and for sure their grandchildren, would have perfect, or virtually perfect, English or French. In our view, to put the age back to 54 rather than 64 was in deference in part to older people, although I am now 65, so I never thought 64 years old was that old, but older compared with many others. We thought that was an appropriate move.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4237700">On the question of level, that point has been raised by my provincial counterparts from British Columbia and Ontario. We will meet next week and we will talk about that. I do not think the level would be in the legislation because it would be a matter for regulation, but at what level those tests should be is a legitimate item for discussion.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I would not deny that it is always a good thing for newcomers to Canada to have a good knowledge of English or a good knowledge of French, or even both. However, the balance has to be made between the situation of the newcomers and the situation they are coming to.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237704">If people are 60 years old and they are coming with perhaps children and a spouse, it is normal to think that their English language skills would not necessarily be so great as if they were younger. If they are older people, their children will probably be fluent, or near fluent, and certainly their grandchildren will be. </ParaText><ParaText id="4237705">The way we have always done it in our country is that often people on the initial entry had far from perfect English, but then they improved, and their children and grandchildren were perfectly fluent.

I would like to start with a very brief one.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237714">On August 29, 1900, in the village of Zavar in Slovakia, a woman named Maria Krajcovic was born. The town was a very small farming town, primarily agricultural. She grew up there. She married a man named Frank Oravec. They had two young daughters, named Helen and Stefania.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237715">In the early 1930s, when both of their girls were still quite young, I believe under the age of seven, Frank decided to travel to Canada to work with the CPR. That was a very difficult decision at the time. One can imagine leaving a wife and two young daughters at a time when Europe was becoming increasingly more uncertain. It was a quite difficult decision.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237716">Maria had to sell some of her property and move in with her mom in order to take care of her daughters while Frank was overseas working to save enough money to send back to the family. Thankfully Maria was quite a talented seamstress. She did needlework and made beautiful lace, and was able to support and provide a living for her daughters.</ParaText>

I should have my dates correct when I tell a story, but I believe it was November 1940 when Hitler's Nazis took over the country. It was a very bleak time indeed for the citizens of Zavar.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237718">In July 1938, Maria did all of the paperwork, and it was very difficult at this time, to get her two daughters to a point where they could travel overseas and join her husband in Canada. That took place in July 1938, right before all of this happened. They travelled to Winnipeg to start a home.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237719">At this time, Helen was 15 years old. They came to Canada with nothing. Helen had to work, cleaning homes. While she worked close to 15-hours days, she put herself through school in the evenings to learn English. She worked really hard. She ended up marrying a man who was 25 years her senior. She had five girls and they farmed in Starbuck.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237720">She has been known to say that people are lucky if they get one good year out of five. When her daughters were all very young, she was widowed, and she had to make the decision to move into Winnipeg with her five young girls. She worked two jobs to put food on the table.</ParaText>

She had two daughters named Cherie and Michelle. Kim went back to school when she was in her 30s. Helen decided that she would spend her retirement years raising Sherry and Michelle. She imparted many values of Slovak heritage, hard work, and ethic into those girls.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237722">I have my family's original voyage of passage here today. I remember when I found this document in my grandmother's house as we were packing up to put her into an assisted living facility. I remember asking her why she would make the decision to do this, and why great-gramma would bring the family overseas. She said that they did it to be safe, to be free, to build their future and mine, and to build a better country. With that in my heart, I find myself here today in Canada's Parliament speaking to the bill before us.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="30">(1630)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4237723">Canada is a country of immigrants who stand on the traditional lands of, and shoulder-to-shoulder with, first nations and aboriginal peoples who bring their wealth of experience, their thoughts, their hopes, their desires, and their dreams together under a banner of pluralism, freedom, and language.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237724">This makes us unique. Our diversity is our competitive advantage. It keeps our economy growing. It keeps our public policy discourse vibrant. It enriches our civil society and keeps us hopeful and optimistic. Because of this, in my view, immigration policy in Canada should never be about why but about how. In this I believe that my Liberal colleagues and I are united. The bill contains a lot of how. It contains fundamental changes to how and under what circumstances we grant citizenship in our country, and for that it should be scrutinized carefully and objectively, which I will try to do now.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4237725">First of all, the bill has several components. The first component the minister has already spoken to, and removes the grounds of the revocation of Canadian citizenship that relate to national security. The minister spoke at length on this. </ParaText><ParaText id="4237726">I am really enjoying this critic portfolio because I believe that immigration will be at the core of many of the public policy challenges we will be facing in the next 10 to 20 years in Canada, especially since we have an aging workforce. </ParaText><ParaText id="4237727">I believe that new Canadians enrich and strengthen our country. Their experiences and perspectives, as much as my experience is grounded in the experience of immigrants, make us stronger. As I said, it leads to more vibrant public policy. </ParaText><ParaText id="4237728">My concern with this element of the bill is that it is the government's first priority. It does revoke the citizenship of a convicted terrorist and I do not think we can be glib or flippant about that. I will be the first one to admit that issues pertaining to this were highly contentious during the election campaign, but because they are contentious, it does not absolve us in this place of the ability and the duty to speak to these issues. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4237729">I find it shocking that this is the government's first priority in the bill, and I do not accept the argument that the former government's act somehow created two classes of citizens. It did not, and there are other grounds by which citizenship can be revoked, which the minister did not really speak to.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237730">I read an article about two Nazi war criminals in 2007 who had their citizenship revoked. Citizenship can still be revoked on the grounds of fraudulent methods, so there are other provisions in Canadian law that the bill does not change. It allows for citizenship revocation. </ParaText><ParaText id="4237731">The discussion around this provision really boils down to what we value about Canadian citizenship. The Liberal government has put forward the following argument. If someone is a convicted terrorist and has dual national citizenship, the government believes that the person can serve his or her term out in jail and that this would be an appropriate penalty for that. The alternative to that is that if someone is a dual national citizen and has committed a terrorist act against Canada, which does affect all Canadians, as we saw here in October 2014, their citizenship should be revoked.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4237732">I am trying to be very respectful here and would ask the Liberals that as we go forward in the debate here, we do not debase this conversation to a fallacy, that the existing act created two classes of Canadian citizenship. This is a choice on punishment for a very serious act against our nation. The bill makes a choice in that regard. For that reason, I oppose this particular section of the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237733">The second section of the bill removes the requirement that an applicant intends, if granted citizenship, to continue to reside in Canada. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="35">(1635)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4237734">As I was cleaning out a trunk in my grandmother's basement, it was incredible to find newspaper clippings from the 1940s from the <I>Winnipeg Free Press</I>, which talked about the role of the Slovak community during wartime and its nascent roots in Winnipeg. When people moved to Winnipeg—my family, my ancestors—it was not all about tough times but joy. My great grandma wrote a play. She was an actor. I guess there was something inherited there. She contributed to the community. I also found records of my great grandfather who fundraised for the Slovak Catholic parish in Winnipeg. </ParaText><ParaText id="4237735">When we celebrate immigration and diversity, we should be celebrating the fact that we want people to stay here and enjoy the experience of being a Canadian and contributing back to our country. It is what has made us amazing. It is what we should be celebrating as we work towards Canada's 150th anniversary.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237736">It is quite reasonable, given that this is the spirit that binds our pluralism, to say that when people want to become Canadian citizens, they intend to stay here and make this nation stronger, as we commit to do the same for them. Taking this requirement out of the existing act removes the spirit and intent of that legislation. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4237737">The third component of this bill seeks to reduce the number of days during which a person must have been physically present in Canada before applying for citizenship. The same argument applies there. I was reading the committee testimony for the bill that was previously before Parliament and made some of these changes. Some of the quotes from the testimony can be distilled to the following, that the longer an individual lives, works, or studies in Canada, the greater connection that person will have to our beautiful and special country. I do not see this as a punitive measure. </ParaText><ParaText id="4237738">I say that if people become citizens of this country, which I hope they do, and want to run for office, vote, or have any of the privileges that are accorded with Canadian citizenship, the time they have spent here gives them a greater understanding of Canadian pluralism and what unites us, such as gender equality, freedom of speech, freedom of sexual orientation, all the things that allow us to function and coexist as a nation of many nations under the same common banner. They need to experience that to be Canadian citizens, and that is the spirit of what this change was. That is my concern with reducing it. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4237739">I also do not think it provides an unnecessary barrier. I am looking forward to hearing witnesses at committee who can argue otherwise, but going into that debate, my sense is that it imparts the value of Canadian citizenship and imparts to people going through the citizenship process the point that Canada wants to invest in them during that process. We want to welcome them into our cultural institutions, we want them to learn what it means to be Canadian citizens, we want them to understand the public policy dialogue.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237740">The fourth section limits the requirement to demonstrate knowledge of Canada in one of its official languages to applicants between the ages of 18 and 54. Previously, that restriction was set at 64 years of age. We often talk about one of the public policy challenges that we will be dealing with in the next 10 years, which is how to continue to knit together Canada's pluralism, which I just spoke about, as we increase and embrace more Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237741">I will add that the Conservative government welcomed over 1.6 million new Canadians during its time in office, which was a significant number. Moreover, year over year on an annualized basis, that number was significantly higher than under the previous government to ours. I applaud its efforts to look at the citizenship numbers and situations, but I also think, to give credit where credit is due, that Conservatives increased that number significantly.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4237742">As we continue to do that and look at pluralism, there are many things that unite us, and language is one of them. Language is a unifier. Language binds us together. It allows us to have shared common experiences that we can communicate. I strongly believe that rather than talking about reducing the age limit, we should be talking about whether it is a barrier for someone over that age. I would argue that 55 is not that old. Fifty-five is probably the new 18. It is not that old. I would argue that someone who is 55 years old, or 54, still has a significant amount of life experience to contribute. If it is a barrier to learning the language, then how do we overcome the barrier?</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="16" Mn="40">(1640)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4237743">One of the things that concerns me about the Syrian refugee initiative is the reports that new people coming to Canada through that initiative are waiting months for access to language training services. I am not sure why the government's first reaction in the bill has been to lower the language requirements rather than asking how we can help them learn the language. That is important. It allows them to participate in so many different facets of Canadian society in a way that opens doors to them. It allows them to experience so many different things. That is why language proficiency is so important.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237744">I am really curious why the government would reduce this. It is something I look forward to hearing about at committee as well. My gut reaction to this after I found some of my grandmother's notes is that we should be asking how we can help someone learn English rather than reducing the requirement. She was 15-years-old and worked so hard to learn English. She put herself through that program by herself. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4237745">There are other components of the bill, which I believe are more technical amendments, which I do support. Overall, especially in the context of the government's tabling of its immigration levels report yesterday, I feel that it is a separate policy argument for a separate time. The government is proposing a significant change to the ratio of people who come to Canada under economic immigration classes, like the federal skilled worker programs, versus those who come in through streams such as the refugee initiative. However, in the context of the provisions of the bill, those numbers are very important. If we are talking of a 250% increase in refugees coming into Canada and our first response has been to lower the language requirement, I hope we can have more language training services. However, the age that someone can become a Canadian citizen without language proficiency is an issue. </ParaText><ParaText id="4237746">When we talk about changing the intent to reside in Canada, when we are increasing overall numbers of immigrants to Canada, that is an issue. How are we providing services?</ParaText><ParaText id="4237747">I asked a question of the minister earlier, which is serious. There are so many people who want to come to our country that processing times are an issue. I hear about that every day. How can we fix spousal sponsorship processing times? </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4237748">If we are changing the system and changing the formula of how many people come to our country, and we do not have a plan to resource that, either through faster processing times or providing long-term housing to refugees, that is of concern. My colleague from the NDP, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214258" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation>, talks about 70% of refugees still being in temporary accommodation. Regardless of political stripe, that is something we need to be concerned about. </ParaText><ParaText id="4237749">My concern with the bill is that it puts the cart before the horse in a lot of ways. It looks at issues that perhaps are not of the utmost concern with regard to immigration policy in Canada. I hope we can come to some sort of consensus because this is something that is going to affect our country over the next 10 years. We need people from other countries to ensure that lack of skilled labour is not detrimental to economic growth, that we are meeting our humanitarian obligations overseas, and we are looking at family reunification, but we are doing it in a way that is resourced. It should be done in the context of a budget that is manageable and with an overall plan for the economy that allows that Canadian advantage, that thing that brought my great-grandmother over to this country with two young girls and nothing else. </ParaText><ParaText id="4237750">I hope I have conveyed my thoughts in a very non-partisan manner. I am happy to take any questions. </ParaText>

In fact, during the campaign, I came across someone who has dual citizenship in the United States. As it happens, she is in the film industry. She travels a lot with her work.

It is all subject to her work.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237798">With Bill <Document DbId="6401990" Type="3">C-24</Document>, she was concerned that her intent to reside in Canada could be challenged and that she might lose her citizenship. This is just plain wrong. I am glad that Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document> addresses this concern.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237799">The Conservative Bill <Document DbId="6401990" Type="3">C-24</Document> also made the pathway to citizenship for immigrants harder, longer, and frankly with other measures, more expensive to obtain. Accessibility to citizenship is the ultimate pathway to a person's right to fully participate in a democratic society. The cornerstone of a democracy is imbedded in having the right to vote. Creating additional barriers to access this citizenship only serves to undermine our democratic institution.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237800">To that end, the NDP also supports the measure in Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document> that returns physical presence requirements to what they were prior to Bill <Document DbId="6401990" Type="3">C-24</Document>, allowing time in Canada prior to obtaining permanent residence to partially count toward the physical presence requirement.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4237801">As I previously mentioned, there is a countless number of legitimate situations that would require a permanent resident or citizen to leave the country for an extended period of time. Restoring the old physical presence requirements is a step in the right direction, as is giving at least partial credit for the time spent in this country before obtaining permanent residence.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237802">Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, IRCC, officials take their work seriously and work judiciously to ensure that every permanent resident meets the requirements to become a new Canadian.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237803">The Conservative former Bill <Document DbId="6401990" Type="3">C-24</Document> was brought in under the pretext that the provisions within the bill strengthened the meaning of being a Canadian, when in fact I would argue it served to undermine many of our strongly held Canadian values and principles.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237804">As stated by Mitch Goldberg, president of the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers, “Instead of welcoming new Canadians, the new Citizenship Act discriminates against them”.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237805">Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document> would rectify this, and the NDP welcomes the amendments proposed under Bill C-6.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237806">With that being said, I would be remiss if I did not turn my attention to what is missing in Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document> as well. First, on the right to judicial review before losing citizenship, I was glad to hear the minister reference this, and his willingness to entertain amendments.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4237807">Prior to Bill <Document DbId="6401990" Type="3">C-24</Document>, individuals who were accused of fraud and risked having their citizenship revoked could request a hearing before a Federal Court judge who would review the minister's evidence. A final decision would then be made by the Governor in Council.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237808">Bill <Document DbId="6401990" Type="3">C-24</Document> allowed the minister to make a decision based on a review of paperwork with no right to a judicial hearing. The NDP believes that a citizen facing revocation should always have the right to a hearing before an independent and impartial decision-maker.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237809">Under Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document>, which was tabled, we believe that the Liberals agree with that as well. In fact, the Liberals tabled an amendment to Bill <Document DbId="6401990" Type="3">C-24</Document>, which would provide the right to a full appeal to the Federal Court in the case of citizenship revocation proceedings. In support of the amendment, a Liberal member stated quite clearly that Canadians deserve the right to appeal with regard to citizenship.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237810">However, today the Liberal Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document> does not deliver on that sentiment. The Liberals' failure to address this feature of Bill <Document DbId="6401990" Type="3">C-24</Document> means, I am afraid, that there may still be a constitutional challenge of the Citizenship Act, which would be viable.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4237811">Second, on the issue regarding people charged with a criminal offence abroad, Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document> does not amend the provision that prohibits granting citizenship to anyone charged with or serving a sentence for a criminal offence abroad. This broad measure fails to account for countries dealing with corruption within government and the judicial system, as well as governments engaging in political prosecution.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237812">The Canadian Bar Association and others have further argued that this prohibition was far too broad and created significant inequalities between applicants, depending on their country of origin.</ParaText>

While Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document> would revoke the changes made by Bill <Document DbId="6401990" Type="3">C-24</Document> by bringing back the language knowledge requirements for applicants aged 18 to 54 instead of 14 to 64, the threshold for language proficiency under Bill C-24 remains.</ParaText>

To this day, I would say that, if my mother were put to a test such as the one that exists right now, she would likely fail that test. Yet, all of her life since she immigrated here, she worked, first as a farm worker, making $10 a day to support a family of eight. Then she got a minimum-wage job at a restaurant, which she retired from at 65, and she supported her family every single day with those efforts. She spoke minimum English—enough to get by, enough to support her family, enough to vote and understand what voting means and what democracy means.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237823">With that being said, I would argue that the proficiency test is way too high for far too many immigrants, and that must change.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237824">Fifth is the issue of financial barriers. Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document> does not address how much permanent residents should pay for their citizenship applications to be processed by the ministry.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237825">Citizenship processing fees have increased from $100 to $530 since February 2014, under the Conservatives. This is on top of the additional $100 right of citizenship fee. A family of four would have to pay $1,460. That is more than a month's rent for many. A family's bank account should not be the deciding factor on whether or not they can become Canadian citizens. </ParaText>

The truth of the matter is that if people commit crimes, whatever crime it might be, whether a crime of national interest or any other crime, they should go through the Canadian judicial system equally, fairly, and independently. Everyone should go through that process. No one should be able to escape that process. They should go to trial and then, if convicted, through the sentencing process as well. There should not be a two-tier process of what the sentencing might be depending on one's place of origin.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237846">That being said, on the issue of fraud, the member actually raised a slightly different point, in this sense.

							<ParaText id="4237866">The second concept that was articulated by the minister was with respect to peeling back the changes found in Bill <Document DbId="6401990" Type="3">C-24</Document> that imposed new barriers on welcoming immigrants to this country and becoming Canadian citizens. </ParaText><ParaText id="4237867">There are a series of four provisions within Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document> that attempt to bring back a much more welcoming atmosphere to becoming a Canadian citizen. Those are very important principles. However, I want to focus on two different principles. </ParaText><ParaText id="4237868">I first want to note that I appreciated the speech made by my friend from the New Democratic Party, the member for <Affiliation DbId="214258" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation>, who I thought articulated in very clear terms the reasons why her party would be supporting the provisions of Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document>.

							<ParaText id="4237871">The first concept I want to advance, which was a central theme that had been articulated by the previous government and in particular by the former minister of citizenship and immigration, Chris Alexander, is the concept that citizenship is a privilege as opposed to a right. I strongly disagree with the former minister's position on this substantive fate.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237872">The whole concept of strengthening the Canadian Citizenship Act, as minister Alexander had framed it, was that citizenship was somehow a privilege. From my perspective, once it is conferred, it attaches rights. There are obligations and responsibilities that come with citizenship, but it confers rights that are protected specifically under the charter, as my friend from <Affiliation DbId="214258" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation> had noted. Therefore, once it is legitimately acquired, the concept of citizenship should not be taken away capriciously.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237873"> That brings me to the second concept. My friends in the New Democratic Party touched upon this particular theme both in the comments made by my friend from <Affiliation DbId="214258" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation> and in the question from the finance critic for the NDP, which is the concept of the encroachment of executive power and the lack of procedural due process that was found under Bill <Document DbId="6401990" Type="3">C-24</Document>. Again, I deeply oppose this concept.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="30">(1730)</Timestamp><ParaText id="4237874">I take the comments that my friend from <Affiliation DbId="214258" Type="2">Vancouver East</Affiliation> noted seriously.

This government would be amendable to those kinds of amendments to the legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237875">I found particularly odious the previous government's perspective to grant the minister the arbitrary right to decide which individuals would get to keep their citizenship and which ones would not. It was particularly odious because it could be done capriciously and without any sort of procedural due process. There would be no capacity to appeal. There would be no capacity to bring new facts to the table.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237876">I know what members of the Conservative Party are ultimately going to say. They are going to say we would only be stripping citizenship from convicted terrorists. All we heard in the debate in the House from the previous minister and from my friends in the opposition is that at the end of the day once individuals are convicted of a particular crime, they should serve their time, and that is the ultimate sanction. Stripping citizenship from certain classes of individuals is not fundamentally appropriate.

It was one of the proudest days of my life and something I had dreamed about ever since I moved to Canada in January of 1984.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237893">This is my frame of reference in speaking in support of Bill <Document DbId="8117654" Type="3">C-6</Document>. I always understood Canada to be a country that welcomed refugees and immigrants and inspired them to strive to become Canadian citizens, to take that step toward full membership and permanent belonging in Canadian society. This is why Conservative Bill <Document DbId="6401990" Type="3">C-24</Document>, introduced in 2014 by the previous government, is so concerning to Canadians across Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="4237894">Even the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="214466" Type="2">Calgary Forest Lawn</Affiliation>, a former parliamentary secretary and the longest continuously serving Conservative MP in the House, has publicly said that he has always opposed the bill. </ParaText><ParaText id="4237895">The member has been quoted as stating that he was “taken to task” by members of his own party for being one of the few MPs on that side of the House to vote against Bill C-24. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4237896">Bill C-24 was an attempt by the Conservative Party to fundamentally change what it meant to be a Canadian as part of political branding exercise. The act created two classes of Canadians: those that only had Canadian citizenship and those who were at risk by having dual citizenship. Using their typical rhetoric of being tough on terrorism as justification, the Conservatives completely devalued what it meant to hold a Canadian passport. </ParaText><ParaText id="4237897">One of the most troubling aspects of the act is the way that Canadian citizenship could be so easily revoked. For example, convictions abroad that convinced a government official that an individual was a national security threat may prompt a process where Canadian citizenship could be stripped away. </ParaText><ParaText id="4237898">By no means does our government support citizens involved in terrorist offences, or espionage, or treason inside or outside of Canada's borders. However, this ability to remove citizenship from dual citizens is a problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237899"> First, a Canadian citizen without dual citizenship from another country could never have their passport revoked for the same crimes committed abroad.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237900"> Second, it makes Canadian citizenship a tool for the criminal justice system. Punishment for crimes should be decided in courts of law, either in Canada or outside of Canada, but the possibility of losing one's Canadian passport as a form of punishment is completely inappropriate.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237901"> Last, for the minister to have such wide discretionary powers in the review and revocation process is a complete breach of due process and fairness. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4237902">There are also aspects of the Conservative's Bill C-24 that only serve to discourage immigrants from wanting to become Canadian citizens. Immigrants want to apply for Canadian citizenship are automatically treated with distrust. The act measures their loyalty and attachment to Canada by the days they were physically present in the country. As a result, thousands of immigrant applicants are forced to sacrifice academic and employment opportunities or family obligations abroad just so they do not put their citizenship application process in jeopardy.</ParaText>

							<ParaText id="4237929">Second, for over six decades, the Canadian Citizenship Act has required applicants to be able to communicate in one of Canada's two official languages. There is a reason why citizenship is an essential sign of our community and national identity. To be a full member of a community, a person must at least have the ability to communicate with other members of that community. It is no coincidence that “communicate” and “community” come from the same root word.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237930">In a country as diverse as ours, it is essential that we have certain commonalities in order to be unified in our diversity. One of these essential commonalities is the ability to communicate in one of the two official languages.

However, since the Canadian Citizenship Act was passed in 1947, we have been encouraging them to work toward successfully meeting that goal and thus becoming full members of our community.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237931">Third, the 1947 act requires a basic knowledge of Canada, our laws, customs, values, democratic institutions, and history because this great democracy did not happen by chance.

This is not and should not be considered an exclusively conservative value or idea. It was, after all, the late Prime Minister Mackenzie King who adopted the Citizenship Act in 1947 with these clear obligations for new Canadian citizens. It was former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, who, in 1997, spoke in the chamber about the need for civic literacy as one of the factors to bind us together. What did he mean by civic literacy?

That still gave people a great deal of flexibility, one-third of the time spent outside of the country to address the kind of exigencies mentioned by the previous speaker.

They will get two or three images of Canadians who have travelled to join a group. It is not just some group of militants, but a genocidal terrorist organization that has declared hostility and war on Canada and inspired an attack on this very Parliament. It is crucifying children, beheading members of religious minorities, and raping girls as young as eight. They have gone to join that organization, whose membership is illegal in Canada. In more than one of those images we can see these “Canadians” burning and shooting their Canadian passports. </ParaText><ParaText id="4237957">The position of the members opposite appears to be that, if those men who are clearly expressing their violent hatred for Canada were to download a form from CIC's website to renounce their citizenship, fill out the form, sign it, put it in an envelope, and send it to Ottawa, they could therefore renounce their citizenship. That is a terribly cramped and legalistic view of the facts and of citizenship.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4237958"> I am sorry, but if individuals deliberately go and join an organization at war with Canada—parenthetically, committing genocide—destroy their Canadian passports as a clear indication of their renunciation of those passports and the citizenship they symbolize, we should have no compunction about saying we read their actions for what they are, they constitute renunciation, and we will renounce their citizenship if they are engaged in such acts of terrorism.</ParaText><ParaText id="4237959">The member for <Affiliation DbId="214382" Type="2">Saanich—Gulf Islands</Affiliation>, for whom I have great respect, raised a completely ridiculous, demagogic argument. This is not about having a sign of Che Guevara on a website requiring a conviction in a Canadian court of a terrorist offence or treason that would carry at least a two-year penal sentence. No one in the history of our legal system has faced a terrorist conviction of two years for expressing views. This is about violent terrorism. </ParaText><ParaText id="4237960">What the government is telling us in the bill is that someone can take up arms against our country, so violently do they hate it, like that man in Toronto whose citizenship has been revoked. He was the ringleader of a plot that planned to kill thousands of his fellow citizens in an act of extreme political violence, to demonstrate his violent hatred for our country. In so doing, he renounced his citizenship. He did so through his volition.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4237961">The power of revocation simply reflects the volition of those who renounce it violently through such acts of treason or terrorism. The power of revocation does not apply to immigrants versus native-born citizens, as the demagogues in this debate have implied. The only reason it is limited to dual citizens in this application is our legal obligation under the international convention on the prevention of statelessness. </ParaText><ParaText id="4237962">Therefore, I appeal to the members opposite and around this place to think seriously about the meaning of our citizenship and to oppose the provisions of the bill. </ParaText>

It is now in the hands of our Justice officials in consultation with our ministry of health officials. </ParaText><ParaText id="4238036">There is an important discussion taking place between those officials because of our interest in maintaining the safety and health of all Canadians. That review is taking place, and when it is completed a decision will be made by the ministry with respect to how the Federal Court's decision will be dealt with. However, I want to assure the member opposite and the House of our unwavering commitment to work expeditiously to address the public safety and public health concerns of all Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="4238037">I would also like to take this opportunity to clarify exactly what has been said.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4238038">During the campaign, our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> was unequivocal. He said that it was our government's intention to legalize, regulate, and restrict marijuana. We set our goals on the protection of our children, to reduce and restrict access that children have to this drug, because the overwhelming evidence of the science is that marijuana can be a very unhealthy thing for developing minds in adolescence and young adults. We want to protect our children and believe that can be done far more effectively through a regulatory regime than through criminal sanction.</ParaText><ParaText id="4238039"> We also want to take the profits of the illegal marijuana market away from organized crime and reduce its influence on our communities. I can say from experience, having worked in many of our disadvantaged communities, that the level of violence and victimization that takes place in those communities as a direct result of the illegal activity around marijuana takes a terrible toll on those communities. We believe that a strictly regulatory regime based on a public health model will protect our communities, as well as protect our children.</ParaText><ParaText id="4238040">We believe that a public health approach will enable this country to assure all Canadians in all communities that marijuana can be made available legally to responsible adults, but that its production, distribution, retail, and consumption would be controlled by regulation to ensure that we can achieve both our public safety aims and public health aims. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4238041">Now the member opposite has also asked the very important question of when this will be done.</ParaText><ParaText id="4238042">Our <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> said that he would begin this work right away, and the work has begun. I have been given direction by my minister to be the government's liaison on this initiative. Our minister has indicated that she is establishing a federal-provincial-territorial task force responsible for the development of these regulations based on research and evidence. That task force is currently being assembled, and I am hoping for an opportunity in the coming weeks to advise the House of the progress we have made.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We would like to know when the Liberals intend to legalize marijuana. Will it be this year? Will it be during the next election? That is what people are confused about right now.</ParaText><ParaText id="4238044">As the parliamentary secretary said, this could take a while because there are consultations and research to be done. In the meantime, young people or others who use marijuana for personal use could be arrested by the police. Given that marijuana is still outlawed, those people could end up with a criminal record. </ParaText><ParaText id="4238045">The <Affiliation DbId="214296" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself admitted that he has used marijuana, smoked a joint. He was lucky he was not arrested. He does not have a criminal record or stains on his record, which allows him to be a minister.

We rely on evidence and the advice of experts. A report by the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto has indicated that decriminalization is a half measure that will do nothing to reduce the social harms of marijuana, that it does not protect our kids, that it does not take away the profit from organized crime, and that it does not facilitate a robust public health response.</ParaText><ParaText id="4238049">The evidence of other jurisdictions has told us that ineffective half measures, such as decriminalization, will only complicate and undermine the implementation of an effective regulatory regime that will achieve our public health and public safety goals.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It is unacceptable that people's finances should determine their access to health care.</ParaText><ParaText id="4238052">In November, my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="214102" Type="2">Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie</Affiliation> wrote to the minister to inform her about this situation, and I have risen twice in the House to ask the minister what the federal government is going to do to put a stop to this practice.</ParaText><ParaText id="4238053">The minister did reply to the letter, but she did not say a word about ancillary health fees even though her mandate letter clearly states that her “...overarching goal will be to strengthen our publicly-funded universal health care system”. To me, strengthening a universal health care system does not mean forcing patients to pay $500 for the use of instruments involved in performing a colonoscopy. Allowing ancillary fees results in unequal access to medical services, and the federal government should intervene to stop this. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4238054">If we take a look at some of the ancillary fees that are being charged, we can see some alarming figures: $40 for the application of a four-square-centimetre bandage following a minor surgery, $200 for the insertion of an IUD, $500 for the use of instruments. One need only take a quick glance at the Canada Health Act to know that such practices are against the law.</ParaText><ParaText id="4238055">The law specifically states that provincial and territorial health insurance plans must provide coverage for all medical and hospital services that are medically necessary. Charging ancillary fees for health care services clearly violates the principle of fair and universal health care coverage. In this specific case, the Canada Health Act is not being enforced.</ParaText><ParaText id="4238056">What is more, this system has encouraged health processionals to adopt practices that go against the principles of equity and universality. For example, some doctors' offices charge $300 for $20 eye drops, or $150 just to create a file. </ParaText><ParaText id="4238057">In some cases, the legalization of ancillary fees has led some doctors to violate their code of ethics. This measure violates the principle of equity and is misleading for Quebeckers. We need to stand up for the principle of a free, accessible, and universal health care system.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4238058">Allow me to recap. Quebeckers are becoming poorer as a result of the legalization of ancillary fees. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Canada ranks second in pharmaceutical expenditures per capita. This affects everyone.</ParaText><ParaText id="4238059">This measure affects the quality of life and the health of citizens. In this case, there is a huge gap between the rich and the poor. No one should have to choose between getting treatment and paying rent.</ParaText><ParaText id="4238060">In addition, there is a risk that other provinces could adopt this plan, which would lead to interprovincial medical tourism.</ParaText><ParaText id="4238061">This measure is helping create a two-tier health care system. I ask my colleague once again: what will the minister do to ensure that the public health care system is accessible from coast to coast to coast?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I am pleased to have the opportunity to comment.</ParaText><ParaText id="4238063">Let me begin by assuring members that the government is fully committed to protecting our publicly-funded health care system and will defend the fundamental tenet that all Canadians should have reasonable access to medically necessary care based on need and not the ability to pay. </ParaText><ParaText id="4238064">In fact, the fear that user charges and extra billing would erode access to needed medical care and lead to a two-tier health care system was the major motivation in the development of the Canada Health Act. </ParaText><ParaText id="4238065">Prior to the act, many Canadian families were left to pay doctor and hospital bills out of pocket. Those who were able to pay received the medical attention they needed, but those without sufficient means either did not get the required care or struggled to find the money to pay for it. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4238066">Essentially, the Canada Health Act was brought into force to protect the basic values of fairness and equity that are fundamental to the Canadian identity. The act sets out national standards for provincial and territorial health insurance schemes and promotes these standards by linking federal health funding to them. Our government stands by these national standards and will continue to uphold this commitment to all Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="4238067">If physicians charge patients a fee when providing an insured service in their clinics, these charges will contravene the Canada Health Act and will strike at the core principles of public health insurance in Canada. The basic principle of access to health care based on need and not financial ability would be disregarded. </ParaText><ParaText id="4238068">Canadians not only want and expect their governments to work together to preserve, modernize, and strengthen publicly funded health care in Canada but also want them to protect it. Let me again emphasize that it is our government's desire to work in collaboration with the provinces and territories to ensure our publicly-funded health care system is strong and that Canadians have access to the care they need, when they need it.</ParaText><ParaText id="4238069">Some of our greatest achievements as a country, the things that matter most in the daily lives of Canadians, came about when federal, provincial, and territorial governments worked together to forge solutions to complex problems. Medicare is a perfect example of this co-operation and collaboration. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="4238070">Our government will continue to provide this critical leadership and has already taken the first steps by re-engaging with the provinces and territories. Our health care system represents the best of Canadian federalism. It is flexible enough to respond to the different regional needs, while protecting the national principles that Canadians hold dear.</ParaText><ParaText id="4238071">That is why I say with absolute certainty that our government has always defended medicare and will continue to do so. Canadians should have full confidence in our government's determination and ability to uphold the principles of the Canada Health Act. Working with the provinces and territories, our goal is to ensure that Canadians continue to have access to high quality care, regardless of their ability to pay.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
