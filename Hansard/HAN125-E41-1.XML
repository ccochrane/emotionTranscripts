We are increasing the income eligibility thresholds for part-time student loans and grants for the next 10 years. Over 2,500 additional part-time students will be eligible for a Canada student loan in year one and 8,000 in year five. Nearly 500 additional part-time students will receive a Canada student grant in year one, rising to about 1,500 in year five and ongoing.</ParaText><ParaText id="2870732">This new measure will help more low- and middle-income Canadians get an education while working. These are hard-working Canadians of all ages who are trying to get ahead and improve themselves. They have no one to help them, yet they are willing to work hard at their jobs and at school. These are great young Canadians building our nation. I am proud to be a member of the government that is helping them out.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Many workers in eastern Montreal who now are unemployed because the government failed to take action to protect their jobs—people who worked at Aveos but also at other companies—are now getting another slap in the face. They studied for years to specialize in aeronautics and other fields, only to have their jobs moved elsewhere, despite the commitments made by the government and Air Canada. Now, they are being told that the rules have changed and that they must forget their training and not expect to get another job in their field.</ParaText><ParaText id="2870734">This government, which criticizes interventionism, is now imposing career choices on Canadians.

It will affect the health, livelihood and future of Canadians, and it will leave an unacceptable and unequal burden on generations to come.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871103">Canadians know intuitively that this cowardly attempt to avoid real debate on such significant legislation is undemocratic. It is another example of the government's penchant for avoiding accountability and scrutiny while it placates its industry bigwig buddies at the expense of the best interests of our communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871104">There will not be sufficient public oversight or consultation on the bill. Communities that are relying on the very protections that are being gutted are being silenced. It is happening because the government knows that if Canadians were given the opportunity to examine this legislation fully, as they should be allowed to do in a democratic nation, they would reject the proposed changes because they recklessly gut environmental protection in this country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871105">New Democrats know and understand the importance of public participation in a democracy. That is why the NDP is holding a series of hearings in Ottawa and across the country that will allow experts and the public to engage in the policy areas of Bill <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document>, such as the anti-environment provisions, in a meaningful way, which the government is trying to avoid.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871106">The latest attempt by the government to hide from the public is yet another blot on the Conservative government's environmental record. From muzzling scientists, to withdrawing from international protocols that included mandatory greenhouse gas emission audits, to killing independent research bodies like the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy and cancelling funding for environmental groups like the Canadian Environmental Network, the government shows time and time again that its number one policy is to stifle as much information and evidence as it can because that evidence flies in the face of the Conservative agenda. </ParaText><ParaText id="2871107">The Conservatives keep forgetting one key thing and that is that Canadians from coast to coast to coast see these actions for what they really are: blindly partisan, incredibly short-sighted and devoid of any evidentiary framework or base.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871108">One of the worst themes of Bill <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document> is the total lack of clarity and understanding on what impact these changes will have on the environmental protections we do have. For me, that is what makes this Trojan Horse bill so alarming. Canadians cannot be sure what the government is actually forcing upon this country.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871109">We see in many different places where this legislation aims to give unparalleled discretion and powers to government and ministers, allowing them to override the best interests of Canadians in affected communities without really defining the scope of powers or important tests that would determine, for example, who could participate in a hearing.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871110">Decisions will be made in the absence of an accountable framework. Make no mistake, these decisions of the future will be politicized and they will be partisan. This again flies in the face of good environmental stewardship.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871111">I would like to talk about some of the proposed changes in the bill. In some of the cases we do not know what the outcome will be. We can see how the legislation is being changed, but we do not know what the impacts will be in the long run. That is all the more reason that we need to have a fulsome debate in the House and at committee on all aspects of the bill.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871112">The entire Environmental Assessment Act is going to be replaced, and it is based on recommendations coming from the environment committee. That might sound like a positive thing, except that the review was the result of a very flawed legislative review at committee. It failed to meet any acceptable standard for a study of such an important piece of legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871113">I would like to talk about a couple of the changes to CEAA that are being proposed.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871114">The bill would limit who could testify at environmental assessment hearings. It would limit that discussion to affected parties. Who is an affected party? Is it someone who lives in a place where a pipeline is going through the backyard? Is it someone who is five kilometres away or twenty kilometres away, or fifty kilometres? Think about Fukushima. How far away did that actually impact? Would people in that radius be able to participate?</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="15" Mn="40">(1540)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2871115">What if people fish, but they fish very far downstream from a spawning bed, and there is an action taking place on a spawning bed? Are they an affected party if they live in southern Manitoba and the spawning bed is in northern Manitoba? Where do we draw the lines here? How do we know who gets to participate? What if they are scientists based out of Vancouver and they have good information about what could happen in northern British Columbia, or perhaps even in another province? Are they considered to be an affected party? </ParaText><ParaText id="2871116">It is absolutely not clear what is being done here in limiting who can testify and who can participate. I am very worried that we are not going to get the good information that we need from the experts and from people on the ground who actually are directly affected, whether or not the government wants to believe they are.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871117">This bill would also allow the federal cabinet to approve a project, even if the reviewing body has determined that there would be adverse environmental effects. In other words, if an arm's-length, non-partisan body says that a project should not go ahead—or yes, it should go ahead, but maybe with these changes—ultimately it is the cabinet that gets to make the decisions about whether that project goes ahead.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871118">We also have a shift of moving from list versus trigger. This is a technical aspect of the bill, but right now an environmental assessment can be triggered because, for example, a navigable waterway is crossed or migratory birds may be impacted. We would switch to a list of what is included and what is not in an environmental assessment. </ParaText><ParaText id="2871119">On its face, this might sound like a good idea, but we heard very good testimony at committee that asked this question: if lists are what is in and what is out, what do we do with projects that we cannot even conceive of right now? For example, if the list had been drawn up 50 years ago, would oil sands exploration have been on that list? Probably not. Do we think there should be environmental assessments of oil sands exploration? Yes. </ParaText><ParaText id="2871120">This change would really limit what gets assessed and how the assessments are done, and it would not follow the evidence that we heard at committee, which is very unfortunate.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871121">I will touch lightly on the fisheries provisions, and I am sure my colleague will also touch on them. </ParaText><ParaText id="2871122">One really important aspect is that under the Fisheries Act provisions, we would change the focus from impacts on fish habitat to impacts causing “serious harm to fish”. What is “serious harm”? Well, let us imagine that a fish is maimed, deformed or has its growth stunted. Maybe its habitat is even destroyed. Maybe a future generation of fish is destroyed. As long as that fish is not killed, it seems it is okay under this legislation. That is absolutely impossible for me to wrap my head around, and it flies in the face of testimony we are hearing from people on the ground, who say that we need to protect fish habitat if we are going to protect the next generation of fish.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871123">I will remind the government that allowing the degradation of our environment has long-term economic costs. The budget bill is not good financial management.The budget bill is not responsible governing. It is, plain and simple, an attack on our environment by a government that lacks the maturity or the common sense to see the long-term risks that it is engaging in. </ParaText><ParaText id="2871124">How will my colleagues opposite explain to their constituents, their friends and their families why they are choosing to reject a path of innovation, environmental stewardship, sustainable development and intergenerational equity? I wonder how they will answer that question to their constituents, their families and their friends.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871125">This legislation would be bad for our air, our water and our soil, and it is bad for humans and animals alike. I ask all members of this place to support our motion today in its denunciation of the government's environmental proposals.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The NDP members did not want to allow the Liberals to speak to it, and NDP members certainly had lots of time and opportunity to make their point at that time. </ParaText><ParaText id="2871130">We continue to debate.

With the stroke of a pen the government would eliminate decades of progress and condemn future generations to deal with its mess. The biggest theme I drew from the budget is the government's focus on mega-industrial projects at the expense of Canada's environment.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871144">Behind the guise of words such as “streamlining” and “modernization”, the government would strip away long-standing regulations that protect our environment from short-sighted unsustainable development.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871145">I would like to speak about the changes to the Fisheries Act that the Conservative government is attempting to sneak in through its Trojan Horse budget bill. These changes are an undemocratic and egregious abuse of power that would do permanent harm to the ecosystem and to Canada's fisheries. Make no mistake, these are radical and dangerous changes. Rather than prohibiting the harmful alteration, disruption and destruction of fish habitat, it would narrow habitat protection to apply to those activities that would harm fish that are part of a commercial, recreational or aboriginal fishery, or the fish that support such a fishery.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871146">The government introduced the concept of “serious harm”, which talks about killing fish and permanently altering habitat. The question that a judge would now be faced with is to determine what constitutes “permanent”. Is that two years? Is that 10 years? Or is that 100 years?</ParaText><ParaText id="2871147">What the Conservative government does not seem to understand is the concept of ecosystem health or biodiversity. If it did, it would know that one cannot protect one species of fish and forsake others.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871148">Looking at the budget implementation act, it becomes even more evident that the Conservative government is not governing based upon fact or science. It certainly did not listen to the 625 scientists who wrote a letter to the <Affiliation DbId="170392" Type="2">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, outlining their concerns with the removal of habitat protection from the Fisheries Act.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871149">In March, a group of Canadian scientists, including many of Canada's most senior ecologists and aquatic scientists, stated:</ParaText>

All species, including humans, require functioning ecosystems based on healthy habitats. The number of animals and plants of any species that can be supported is in direct proportion to availability of habitat, which supplies food and shelter. Habitat destruction is the most common reason for species decline. All ecologists and fisheries scientists around the world agree on these fundamental points, and the Fisheries Act has been essential to protecting fish habitats and the fisheries they support in Canada.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2871151">The scientists called for a strengthening of the Fisheries Act, as well as the Species at Risk Act, and the Migratory Birds Convention Act. Yet the Conservative government is doing the exact opposite and sneaking it through, in a most undemocratic way, I might add, its budget implementation act.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871152">The government is also not listening to the Association of Professional Biology, which said:</ParaText><ParaText id="2871153"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">It is well documented that protection of habitat is the most effective means to avoid species decline and extinction and ensure populations remain resilient to future and ongoing impacts, such as climate change and the cumulative effects on human activities....

At the end of the day, the harder we worked, the more effort we put in, the more we appreciated our university education. That university education allowed me to become a geophysicist, someone who got to practise in northern Quebec, in Nunavut, in Yukon, in the Northwest Territories, in Manitoba and in my beloved home province of Saskatchewan. Therefore, I had the privilege of understanding, not just in the theoretical or the abstract but actually very practical to my own bottom line, the bottom line of my constituents and my personal life, the value of natural resources to us as a country.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871252">Our government's top priority has always been to support jobs and growth and to sustain the Canadian economy. Since we introduced the economic action plan to respond to the global recession, Canada has recovered all of the jobs lost during the recession. In fact, in less than three years since 2009, employment has increased by more than three-quarters of a million, achieving the strongest job growth among the G7 countries, and our natural resource sector is a large part of that extraordinary job growth.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871253"> The natural resources sectors have supported the development of communities large and small throughout our nation and they have helped us to build a quality of life that is second to none in the world. Today, Canada's natural resource sector employs 760,000 Canadians. Furthermore, the resources sectors also generate billions of dollars worth of tax revenues and royalties annually to help pay for government programs and services for Canadians. We can see this future wealth being capitalized and becoming a reality now.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871254"> Over the next decade, Canada could have as many as 500 new projects and $500 billion in investments in energy and mining sectors alone. I will give just one basic example of how this can affect our country.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871255"> In my constituency a potash mine is being developed. When it is developed, as looks very likely to happen, it will be the world's largest potash mine. This project in and of itself is worth over $10 billion. </ParaText><ParaText id="2871256">We see that resource development is not just isolated in Canada to Fort McMurray, to the oil sands, to the region up north. This is something that affects all Canadians. The development of this mine does not just boost economic activity in the riding of Saskatoon—Humboldt in the city of Saskatoon. Much of the engineering for this project is being done in Ontario and Quebec, employing highly skilled engineers in the service industry in eastern Canada. With these projects creating an estimated 700,000 jobs across Canada, they will continue to increase our country's economic prosperity.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871257"> However, we have seen, via the leader of the party, the NDP disagrees. Its leader said that the natural resources were a disease that would destroy the manufacturing sector. In the NDP's world, all of economic growth is a zero-sum game. Good high-paying jobs are all at the expense of the east. Instead of embracing economic growth, the leader of the NDP has chosen to pit one region of the country against another.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871258"> To be perfectly fair, that is not completely accurate because natural resources are an integral part of the entire Canadian economy and when people begin to attack natural resources as damaging other parts of the Canadian economy and other regions of the economy, they attack natural resources industries all across the country. I think of the diamond mines in the Northwest Territories and in Ontario, oil production off the east coast of Newfoundland and Labrador. I think of the Plan Nord going forward in northern Quebec. When they attack natural resources, they attack northern Quebec, Newfoundland, the Northwest Territories, the entirety of the prairie regions and in effect they attack one of the largest economic growth engines of Canada for all 10 provinces.</ParaText>

This motion states that the budget legislation guts the environmental assessment and fisheries laws. The measures included in Bill <Document DbId="5514128" Type="3">C-38</Document> will leave Canada’s lakes, rivers, oceans, ecosystems, and fisheries at risk. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871384">The disastrous report of the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development tabled on May 8 clearly shows that the Conservatives' track record on the environment has been very consistent—it is one of bad faith, mismanagement and contempt for statistics and common sense. What is more, the Conservatives have also acted undemocratically.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871385">The <Affiliation DbId="170677" Type="4">Minister of Foreign Affairs</Affiliation> admitted this week that when the government is not happy with something, it just gets rid of it. That is what the Conservatives did with the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy. They decided to abolish it because the panel of experts dared to discuss a carbon tax. The round table will soon issue a report that shows that the government's lack of action to combat greenhouse gas emissions will be very costly for Canada, much more so than if it were to try right away to establish infrastructure and rules to decrease such emissions. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871386">Because the government seems to be incapable of costing its current reduction plan or the Kyoto plan, I imagine that it will be very interested in this report by the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy, unless it decides to muzzle the scientists once again, as it is so inclined to do. </ParaText><ParaText id="2871387">This is 2012, the 21st century. The Conservatives are playing with the health and safety of Canadians. This government must immediately assume its responsibilities. Is it a question of greed, Nimbyism, incompetence, or all of the above? <Sup></Sup></ParaText><ParaText id="2871388">Yesterday, in committee of the whole, the <Affiliation DbId="165138" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> could not tell us which programs would be abolished by his department and what impact this would have on environmental protection. He was even unable to tell us the type of work that would be eliminated, the work of these thousands of public servants who will be let go.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871389">If the minister himself cannot give us the answers, who else in this government can? Yesterday, we grilled the <Affiliation DbId="165138" Type="4">Minister of the Environment</Affiliation> for four hours without obtaining concise, concrete and clear answers. That is rather disturbing, especially since the people want answers. Canadians want to be consulted, but everything about this government makes it impossible.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871390">Why is this government refusing to do anything tangible about this? Examples, statistics, science all point to how serious this is. We have to act now. All the experts agree on that. Even the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development said so a number of times on Tuesday.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871391">This government has responded by introducing a 431-page omnibus bill that is being decried by every environmental organization and even by former Conservative MPs who were responsible for some of the files. We have a 431-page bill that has a devastating effect on our cultural heritage, among other things.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871392">The Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable Development and experts will not even get the chance to take a critical look at these changes. This is an insult to Canadians and to democracy. It almost feels like we are living in a dictatorship.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871393">Although I could go on about the countless irresponsible and reckless aspects of this bill, I will focus on those concerning the environment, which is the subject of today's motion. Unfortunately, the only thing this government is trying to do is to destroy the environment and destroy progress. Soon it will destroy the economy with all of its destructive measures.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871394">Instead of gutting all of our environmental protection measures and erasing all the progress that has been made over the past few decades—including with regard to the fisheries and the environmental assessments that have taken years to set up—this government should be showing leadership and enhancing environmental protection measures because we are running out of time. There are deadlines to be met.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="10">(1710)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2871395">Even the Commissioner of the Environment said last week that given the Conservatives' efforts or lack thereof, he doubted that the very minimal targets set by this government will be met at the rate we are going today. Is that any way to build a 21st century country? Is that any way to stimulate the economy and boost innovation in the private sector? This is truly quite alarming.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871396">I can think of many positive examples. Consider Germany, for instance, where stricter environmental regulations have led to the growth of the renewable energy sector and helped create thousands of jobs, making the country a world leader in the area of sustainable development. The situation there is much more positive than it is here in Canada right now. Canada has become the black sheep at international conferences on the environment. And Canada ranks third among OECD countries that are the world's worst polluters per capita, right behind Australia and the United States. Congratulations to the Government of Canada. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871397">As the commissioner's report clearly demonstrates, the government needs to stop its archaic way of seeing things. The Conservatives need to wake up. The preventive measures suggested by environmental groups, the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy and a number of experts will not cost anything; in fact, they will save money. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871398">The initial cost of implementing environmental regulations quickly generates savings if we consider the short- and long-term social benefits, as good managers should. We do not have to look far to find a good example of this. The White House's Office of Management and Budget compared the costs and benefits of environmental protection. The United States, our closest neighbour, which the Conservatives so frequently turn to as a policy model, found that the combined cost of all U.S. federal air and water protection regulations is approximately $26 billion per year, yet they save up to $533 billion because of a lower incidence of smog-related respiratory diseases and fewer problems associated with contaminated sites. </ParaText><ParaText id="2871399">It is clear that Canadians' health and safety is closely related to environmental factors such as the quality of the air we breathe, the impact of global warming on food security, the safety of the food we eat and water quality, to name but a few.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871400">The Conservative budget is a perfect illustration of that party's vision, or I should say, lack of vision. In fact, it shows the short-sighted and irresponsible vision of a government that would rather give in to pressure from its friends in the oil lobbies than protect our natural heritage and the health of future generations.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871401">Once again, this government is showing just how willing it is to circumvent democracy and science to concentrate power in the hands of cabinet. The government is grouping measures that fall under the jurisdiction of a dozen committees into a single bill to ensure that these measures will be examined by as few experts as possible. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871402">This week, when the government invoked closure for the 21st time on a bill jam-packed with as many measures as possible, Canadians were denied a fair and thorough debate on issues that will affect their health, their safety and their environment. The government is on a witch hunt, and environmental groups are the target. This is reminiscent of 1950s McCarthyism.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871403">Canadians want the government to prioritize sustainable, responsible development, but this budget undermines—nay, eliminates—all of the environmental safeguards that protect our coasts, our rivers, our wildlife and our food.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871404">Unfortunately, this government puts economic interests, particularly those of large foreign oil companies, before the health of Canadians, long-term energy security, and the protection of Canada's natural heritage.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871405">By eliminating the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, arbitrarily shortening environmental assessments and scaling back experts' and scientists' role in the process, the Conservative government is clearly showing that the environment is not a priority. In fact, the government is showing that the environment is no longer even on its radar.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871406">The Conservatives even have the audacity to believe that cabinet has more expertise to make decisions about major pipeline projects than scientists and experts do. Let us not forget that the Conservatives' estimate for the purchase of the F-35s was out by $10 billion and they responded by saying, “Oops. Sorry.” What will happen if a Northern Gateway spill destroys the magnificent coast of British Columbia near Kitimat, pollutes the drinking water of several hundred first nations communities and threatens the health of our most beautiful forest? Is the government just going to again say, “Oops. Sorry.”?</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="17" Mn="15">(1715)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2871407">For all these reasons, I support the motion. The budget is an absolute affront to democracy, and Canadians deserve much better.

As I said, until now it hasn't been formalized in legislation, and that is what we are trying to do today.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871460">Philanthropy is not an empty concept to Canadians. Canadians from coast to coast recognize the necessity of those who give of their time, money, resources and expertise to assist other Canadians. It is something that distinguishes Canadians. We as Canadians believe very much in the responsibility to care for our neighbours.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871461">When we talk about philanthropy, we are not talking about only those people who have their faces etched on some kind of local statue in bronze or granite. We are talking about those people who give of their time each and every day. We are talking about those 84% of Canadians who give some kind of donation to their local charities and organizations. </ParaText><ParaText id="2871462">We are talking about those people who give significant amounts of their time to local organizations, be it the person who volunteers at a local homeless shelter, senior citizens who give of their time at the local Salvation Army, those who coach local soccer or football, or teachers who give a little extra time at the end of the school day to make sure children have access to a literacy program or something of that nature. Today we are speaking about those people who make our communities better, those who give a little to make sure our communities are better off.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871463">As I said, 84% of Canadians give money to local organizations, and that translates into 23 million Canadians who give to charitable organizations. When we talk about charitable organizations, it is interesting to note that there are over 80,000 organizations across this country that do charitable work. If we consider the contributions made to those organizations, some $10 billion is given on an annual basis. It is a remarkable amount. If one divides that by every Canadian, it is over $400 for every man, woman and child to these organizations.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871464">I spoke about the time that is given to different organizations. We all benefit from having these organizations in our communities. It is estimated that in 2010, more than 13.3 million Canadians, or 47% of the population, volunteered their time to a local group or organization that makes our country a better place. That translates into 2.1 billion hours of volunteer time that is given by Canadians. It is some 1.1 million full-time jobs. </ParaText><ParaText id="2871465">It is a remarkable feat. We as Canadians know we could never repay the efforts. We could never come up with the amount of cash that would be necessary to replace those contributions that Canadians make through their volunteer hours.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="30">(1830)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2871466">Today we are talking about declaring a day to celebrate those folks. It is in no way, shape or form going to make up for the contributions that these people give to Canada on an annual basis, but that is not what we are seeking to do. We know that people who give their time and their money have no expectation of repayment. They do it because they want to build a better community, better and stronger provinces, and a better and stronger country. For that we, as Canadians and parliamentarians, can be proud.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871467">In 2011, our Prime Minister instituted an additional recognition of volunteerism here in Canada with the creation of the Prime Minister's Volunteer Awards. These are some of the most important awards given at the national level. They recognize those people who volunteer their time, who build our communities into better places. They are nominated by people who live in their communities.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871468">This is also a special year. Not only are we celebrating the second year that the Prime Minister's Volunteer Awards will be delivered to Canadians, but we are also celebrating Queen Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee. We will recognize our monarch's 60 years of service by seeing the creation of the Diamond Jubilee Award. It will be given to Canadians across this country who have contributed to their communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871469">Those members of Parliament who are still seeking nominations, and I know in my office we are still seeking nominations, for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Award would all appreciate me letting Canadians know. It is important across party lines that we recognize those people who have built stronger and more vibrant communities. Through this award we will see the celebration of those people who have contributed so much. Again this year as Canadians from coast to coast, we will celebrate another way that we can recognize volunteers and those who contribute to our communities.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871470">This is also a special year because we are celebrating the War of 1812. The question could be asked, what does that have to do with National Philanthropy Day and volunteerism. It really hearkens back to the creation of this nation and the role that volunteers played. Those who volunteered their service during the War of 1812 provided front line service on a voluntary basis. They were not paid for their militia service. They volunteered willingly, knowing that they were putting their lives on the line and believing in what would be Canada. </ParaText><ParaText id="2871471">As we hearken back to that first step in creating this great country, or one of the most important things in establishing this country, we recognize that volunteerism played such an integral role even at that point in time.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871472">I had the opportunity two weeks ago to be in Muskeg Lake, Saskatchewan. We were also in the Whitecap Dakota First Nation. In these communities we heard of people who fought in the War of 1812, first nations people who gave willingly, laying their lives on the line so that we might have this country of Canada. We are thankful for the service that those people gave to Canada, but also for the legacy for the communities.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871473">We heard stories of inspiration, how the French, English and first nations came together to fight a common battle to see Canada created and protected. That legacy has continued even to this day. People continue to volunteer in respect of services. It is good for us to hearken back as we consider philanthropy and some of its origins here in Canada.</ParaText>

In my own riding of Peace River, in the city of Grande Prairie and throughout the northern portions of my riding, we would not be as strong a community as we are today if it had not been for those people who give back. </ParaText><ParaText id="2871475">We know there are business leaders within our community who have contributed significantly over the years to build a stronger community through their financial contributions to local and national charities. I can think of a number of different families. There are the Evaskevich, Henry Hamm, and Abe Neufeld families. I think of Peter Teichroeb and the Bowes family. I think of the Longmate and Diederich families who have contributed so significantly through their financial contributions to our communities. I also think of those people who have given their time. I can speak of Arta Juneau and a whole host of others who have given so significantly.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871476">I am running out of time. I could continue for some time talking about the volunteer contributions of those in my community, but I should leave it there. We should all remember that in each one of our communities there are those people who give of their time and money. They truly are philanthropists.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

For the next 10 minutes, I will have the opportunity to speak about the contribution of philanthropy in the past, present and especially the future.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871478">This is a very important issue for me because I was raised by a grandmother who was extremely committed and devoted everything—her knowledge, time and money—to her community. Today, I have the great pleasure of standing here, among my colleagues, to discuss the spirit of philanthropy. </ParaText><ParaText id="2871479">I hope that everyone agrees to share my philosophy of life and to make our country, and also humanity, their top priority. Each one of us should try to improve the lot of our fellow human beings in many ways, without thought of personal gain. In fact, philanthropy should be a way of life, and it should be based on direct participation. Philanthropy can be an act of giving or an act of love for humanity. In other words, philanthropy is the act of giving of oneself by making a donation of money or time. We are currently projecting that philanthropy is moving in a direction where knowledge, expertise and cultural talent are increasingly vital.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871480">Philanthropy in Canada today is changing faster than ever. More people are engaging in it and are using new media and new technologies to tackle old problems with new strategies. They have new opportunities. We have to rethink our approaches to funding and social investment. Our actions, our practices, our programs and our perspectives are all being constantly challenged. Philanthropy in the future has to present new outlooks and new horizons.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871481"> According to statistics on philanthropy in Canada, on the people who volunteer their time and knowledge, Canada’s non-profit and voluntary sector is the second largest in the world. That of the Netherlands is the largest in the world and that of the United States is the fifth largest. There are an estimated 160,000 non-profits and charities in Canada, over half—54%—of which are run entirely by volunteers. Some 2 million people are employed by these organizations, or 11.1% of the economically active population. The sector accounts for $79.1 billion or 7.8% of the GDP, which is larger than the automotive or manufacturing industries. Smaller provinces have a higher number of these organizations relative to their populations. The top 1% of these organizations command 60% of all revenues in the sector. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871482">Let us look at some past crises in Quebec.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871483">In January 1998, an ice storm hit Quebec. Thousands of homes were without light or heat for over a month. The economy and the environment suffered from this meteorological crisis and the people living in the affected regions still have bad memories of that time. Some $11 million in donations were collected during the ice storm. That is a lot. Where was the government? That is the question. It is always there after the fact and after a considerable amount of time. Yet, the people had mobilized once again. They have a sense of philanthropy. The organizations are always there for their communities and they always act quickly.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871484">In 1996, the Saguenay region was hit hard by flooding. Centraide, the United Way, quickly came to the assistance of community organizations affected by the disaster. Thanks to the generosity of United Way donors across Quebec and Canada, the organization also saw a considerable increase in the number of new applications to the funding allocation committee. Twenty-seven million dollars was raised during the 1996 Saguenay floods. Once again, where was the government? It took an inordinately long time to respond, and once again, volunteers and community organizations were the ones who mobilized, bringing their philanthropic spirit, as well as their knowledge and expertise, to help the people of Saguenay.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871485">Montérégie also experienced flooding recently, when the Lake Champlain basin and the Richelieu River flooded. In 2011, flooding of the Lake Champlain basin caused water levels to rise substantially between late April and the end of June, right after the flooding of the Richelieu River in Canada and Lake Champlain into the United States. On the Quebec side, the floods affected approximately 3,000 residences in Montérégie. Here is yet another example of philanthropy: the Syndicat des cols bleus regroupés de Montréal mobilized, and over 800 blue collar volunteers came to the assistance of the flood victims. Once again, people came together spontaneously. Where were the provincial and federal governments? Their response time was appalling. The people were suffering, but once again, the philanthropic spirit brought people and organizations together to help.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871486">Even the cultural community mobilized. From June 7 to 13, 2011, comedians from the region joined forces to help the victims of the Richelieu River floods. The youth of the Jeune Chambre de commerce du Haut-Richelieu organized this wonderful initiative in order to raise money as quickly as possible in order to help the flood victims. This is just one more example of what philanthropy means.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871487">The purpose of my speech is clear. I want to talk about the current status of philanthropy. As a young, newly elected MP, I look at how things work in government right now, and I see the trust between the people and the government. Voter turnout is declining, people are demonstrating more and more, and it seems that people are becoming more aware of the situation. Unfortunately, that is not because of any decisions the government is making. Instead, it is because of citizen participation and the fact that new media have enabled them to create a social network. It is easier for them to communicate, get organized and talk about various problems. Most importantly, it is easier for them to find solutions. Confidence in organizations, philanthropy, volunteers and ordinary citizens is growing.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871488">We need to be humble as we consider the future of philanthropy and figure out where we want to be. We have to ask a lot of questions that deserve answers. It does not make sense for a government to ignore the people and not connect with them when organizations, for their part, regularly reach out. They know how to use the tools available to them. They have practically no money, but they still achieve real results quickly. Does it make sense that people are giving more and more money to organizations but are becoming less and less willing to give money to the government? I think so.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871489">A self-respecting government that acts in accordance with its beliefs should listen to the people and connect with those who already play an active role.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871490">I am greatly concerned about the approach taken by this government in the current budget. It is becoming decentralized and disorganized. The Conservatives are doing away with agencies that, for generations, have provided important information and made important contributions to our society. The partnership with these agencies made it possible for the government to adapt, to connect with Canadians and to always be aware of their needs, which is key. But now, the government is targeting these agencies and doing away with them rather than going to see them and telling them that perhaps their information is not up to date and that they should adapt. It is a partnership, a listening relationship. The government could take stock of the situation, but it does not.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871491">I sincerely believe that the Conservatives are really starting to fear philanthropy, despite the fact that they claim to be philanthropists. They have begun selecting and sequestering agencies by sidelining them and cutting their funding. Many agencies were not taking a stand before, but they are doing so now. They are coming to tell us that something is not working. Their funding has been cut without notice on flimsy pretexts. Yet, these agencies provide services to people at the national and international level and they get results.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="18" Mn="50">(1850)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2871492">The idea I am trying to convey is that there are huge issues that need to be raised here in the House and that Canadians need to consider. Philanthropy Day is essential but it is only a start. We must go farther than that. We must have a vision. We must implement concrete measures. We may even need to go so far as to create a new department that will have a direct link with all the agencies and deal with the issue of philanthropy, not just in Canada, but globally. We need to become a leader and show that we can have an ongoing connection with all citizens in all circumstances.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871493">Today, I hope that my grandmother, who is no longer with us but who was a great philanthropist, is listening to me and that she is very proud of the message that I have presented to the House today.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I am optimistic all parties and all members will be showing their support.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871497">This bill designates November 15 in each and every year as National Philanthropy Day. The purpose of the bill is to increase public awareness of National Philanthropy Day as a time to thank those who give throughout the year and to focus public attention on major accomplishments made possible through philanthropic contributions. Key local individuals and corporations would be honoured for their philanthropic endeavours. Local fundraisers and volunteers would be recognized and thanked for their time, talent and dedication.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871498">We are talking about almost half of Canadians, because many people volunteer in their communities. However, over the past 20 years, the percentage of Canadians who make charitable donations has been steadily decreasing and the average donor age has been rising. This is why it is important to raise awareness of this issue. By having a National Philanthropy Day, we shine a light on the importance of giving to charitable organizations, volunteering for them and acting in the public interest. It also reminds people that every dollar and every hour of volunteer time counts.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871499">National Philanthropy Day is about encouraging schools, community groups and individuals to become more aware of the impact of philanthropy and to get involved. It is about encouraging young people to get involved, too. As I said, the average age of donors and volunteers is rising. It celebrates the endless daily contributions that individuals and organizations make to countless causes and missions in Canada and beyond.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871500">This year there were more than 100 National Philanthropy Day events and activities across North America. Over 50,000 people participated. Sixteen Canadian events honoured philanthropists and volunteers in most major Canadian cities.

It is about dissenting. It is about organizations telling a government of whatever stripe when the organization believes the government is on the wrong track or is missing an opportunity to improve people's lives.

A number of my colleagues must be wondering why there has not been unanimity on this matter, and this is something that has puzzled me as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871521">Canadians are well known for their philanthropy.

Humanism is at the heart of the priorities of many Canadians for whom the suffering of others is unbearable. It is not necessary to make a financial donation to be considered a philanthropist.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871524">Philanthropy can also be expressed by showing compassion and doing something tangible to change things. Just look at volunteers. They make us realize that being philanthropic is a matter of passion, altruism and self-giving.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871525">I want to share with my colleagues a number of philanthropic acts. Canadian history is filled with memorable examples. Hon. members can judge the generosity and contributions of these prominent philanthropists for themselves.

You do not need to be wealthy to bring about change. Everyone can be socially responsible.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871526">My first example, Elizabeth McMaster, was one of those people. Troubled by the high death rates of children, in 1875, she founded Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children. What is today renowned throughout the world as a leading pediatric health centre was created because a group of women decided to rent a house equipped with only six cots at a cost of $320. </ParaText><ParaText id="2871527">Many of us are probably aware of the important contribution made by Sir Frederick Grant Banting to medicine. In 1922, this Canadian scientist discovered insulin. With no access to research grants at that time, Banting sold his own car to finance his work. In order to ensure that insulin would be affordable to all who needed it, he sold the rights to insulin for the symbolic sum of $1, when he could have made a fortune. Clearly, his motivation was not the same as that of today's pharmaceutical giants.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871528">Terry Fox's 1980 Marathon of Hope stands out as one of Canada's best philanthropic achievements.

Currently, we are seeing growing inequality between rich and poor in Canada. Studies of rich countries have shown that the greater the gap between rich and poor, the worse off everyone is. Conversely, a smaller gap has a positive impact on everyone. </ParaText><ParaText id="2871533">What are those positive effects? Greater social mobility, longer life expectancy and better academic achievement, not to mention lower rates of obesity, homicide and incarceration, to name but a few.</ParaText>

It mobilizes experts in every sector. In terms of environmental protection, we need only think of people such as David Suzuki or Steven Guilbeault. They have devoted their lives to environmentalism for the good of humankind. No one can question their influence and credibility in this field throughout Canada and the entire world. Their role is even more important today when we consider the negligence of this government, which has a permanently withdrawn from the Kyoto accord. I feel reassured knowing that determined people continue to work for our collective interest when it comes to the environment. </ParaText><ParaText id="2871537">Let us also recognize the contribution of Canada's charitable and non-profit sector, which is made up of close to 161,000 agencies and generates billions and billions of dollars a year. Can you imagine the important contribution this makes to our GDP? It is a real economic force in Canada. Would you like to know where Canada stands in this area as compared to other countries? Canada has the second largest charitable and non-profit sector in the world. That is very impressive.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871538">Canadians are contributing financially to this sector in record numbers and many give their time to these organizations. Of course, this sector is quite diverse and that is its strength. Whether we are talking about education, health, social services, housing, environmental protection, the arts, culture or other sectors, they all have a crucial role to play in our society.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871539">I want to reiterate the need to give this day permanent status. That is what the key philanthropic organizations in the country want and for good reason.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871540">This country was built on the generosity of its people. It is our duty to encourage Canadians to want to change things in their communities for everyone's well-being.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871541">Canadians must actively participate in their communities in order to keep their communities thriving. We have to think about the future of philanthropy in Canada in a way that gives the country a more human face. We have to explore the possibilities before us and find the best solutions for the problems facing our communities. </ParaText><ParaText id="2871542">I invite my colleagues to join us in this effort, as this should be a non-partisan issue. Let us recognize this day and become a role model for other countries.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871543">In closing, I would just like to say that I am very involved in my community. That is probably why it was so easy for me during the election campaign because people already knew me. Philanthropy opens up some unimaginable doors for us and that is truly great. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

However, I also strongly believe in the importance of philanthropy. </ParaText><ParaText id="2871546">The main idea behind this bill is to create a permanent philanthropy day by declaring November 15 National Philanthropy Day. This is a laudable goal. </ParaText><ParaText id="2871547">I would argue that it is about time that we recognized philanthropists and philanthropy in this manner. As an elected official, and no doubt like many of my colleagues here in the House, I have had the opportunity and the privilege of attending many philanthropic events in my riding. I am always impressed by how generous the people of Pontiac are with both their time and money. My riding boasts many philanthropic associations, including Lions Clubs, Optimist Clubs, Knights of Columbus, the Masons, religious philanthropic groups, and I could go on. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871548">I am always impressed by the great amount of work these associations do to help people on the margins. They are the ones who provide services and funds when families are really in need. I am also happy to live in a country with such a long-standing philanthropic tradition. Like many Canadians, I was very impressed by how willing my fellow citizens were to help after the earthquake in Haiti. I am pleased to note that, according to a BMO survey on philanthropy, Canadians are still making generous donations despite the difficult situation caused by recent events. For example, some 70% of Canadians donated to charity in the past 12 months. Canadians gave an average of $487 to charities over the past year, and plan to give just as much in 2012. Over the past 20 years in Quebec, the Fondation communautaire du Québec has served as an umbrella organization for over 500 funds created by families, individuals and businesses. These people have seen the opportunity to give to causes that matter to them. Through these funds, donors give back over $1.5 million per year to organizations. </ParaText><ParaText id="2871549">This shows how Canadians and Quebeckers take the true meaning of the word “philanthropy” to heart: “phil” means love, and “anthropy” means human beings. This is about loving human beings. To love our fellow human beings is to help them.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871550">National philanthropy day was celebrated for the first time on November 15, 1986, and Canada was the first country to officially recognize the day in 2009. We can be proud of that and of Bill <Document DbId="5081662" Type="4">S-201</Document>.</ParaText><Timestamp Hr="19" Mn="15">(1915)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2871551">Leading philanthropic organizations have expressed strong support for this bill. The submission by the Association of Fundraising Professionals recommended passing the bill. But we must not heap too much praise on ourselves.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871552">Philanthropic associations are also the first to tell us that it is getting harder and harder for them to do their work in society. Today, there are many obstacles to their operations and major obstacles for Canadian donors.</ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="2871553">If we are to keep the spirit of giving alive in Canada, it will take more than a special day. A report published by the Canadian Centre for Philanthropy discusses some of the challenges to philanthropy today. For example, approximately 4 in 10 donors said that they did not give more because they did not think their donations would be used efficiently.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871554">To retain these donors and encourage them to give more, perceptions about how charities spend their money and what results they achieve from those expenditures has to be addressed and changed.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871555">There are also particular challenges with regard to age. Many charitable organizations and service clubs have an average age which is much too high to be sustainable. Attracting young people is increasingly difficult. Younger donors may need a special approach as we go forward. More than half of younger donors, and that is donors aged from 15 to 34, according to the same report, do not give more money because they want to save for their future needs or because they prefer to spend money in other ways.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871556">Although it may be difficult to overcome financial barriers, particularly with regard to debt for young people, the participation of the youth in philanthropy by giving their time could be made more fun and more social. There is some evidence to point to the fact that event-based fundraising approaches or cause-related fundraising, both of which deliver a benefit while raising money to the individual, are more successful with the young today.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871557">Encouraging youth participation in activities such as team sports, youth groups and student government may also pay dividends in the future. Canadians who have had these early life experiences have been shown to be more likely to donate later in life.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871558">However, many other barriers exist, including education, employment status, household income, culture, et cetera. It is perhaps not surprising to note, though, that Canadians who are older, better educated and have a higher household income are more likely to give out of a sense of religious or civic obligation. Their sense of feeling like they owe something to the community also seems to be higher.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871559">As generations change, one can rightfully ask whether the spirit of giving will continue. It is also interesting to note that the top two reasons why Canadians make charitable donations are they feel compassion for those in need, that is 94% of donors, or they believe in the cause supported by the organization, which is 91% of donors.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871560">It is also interesting to note that more than half, 53% of top donors and a significant percentage of donors in all demographic categories, said that they did not give more because they did not like the way requests for donations were made to them.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871561">Perhaps more fundamentally, we must understand the challenges charitable organizations face today within a larger socio-economic context. Demand is higher and higher as the population grows, but also many of their challenges can be related directly to the lack of commitment of governments to address poverty, particularly of the most vulnerable in our society, such as women, women who are victims of violence, children and seniors.</ParaText>

Any measure which underlines the incredible work done by charities in our country every day can only encourage others to give.

It is the least we can do as parliamentarians.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

With the cuts coming as a result of the recent federal budget, 102,000 more people may be added to the ranks of the unemployed. This is simply shameful.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871574"> However, what is even more shameful is the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation>'s ignorant and haughty attitude toward those who are looking for employment, stating there is no bad job. The only bad job is not having a job, according to the minister. Maybe that is why the government is so reluctant to create a job plan that works, because to the Conservatives there are simply no bad jobs.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871575"> Part-time work. Good job. Job with no security. Good job. Little to no benefits? That is a good job, too. Unfair wages and terrible conditions? That must be a great job.

							<ParaText id="2871577">The government has failed once again by making the wrong choices in this Trojan Horse budget bill.

MDA was also hired to take pictures to monitor the BP oil spill in the gulf. </ParaText><ParaText id="2871580">The applications for this kind of Canadian technology are absolutely endless.

What is disappointing is to hear the NDP, day in and day out, talk down Canada's economy with its nonstop negativity and misleading statistics.

These are independent international bodies.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871585">If the member were more knowledgeable, he would know that Canada has posted the strongest growth in employment in the G7 by far over the past few years.

What is more, since July 2009 employment has increased by over 750,000 jobs.

							<ParaText id="2871586">Contrary to what the members of the NDP might believe, investments made through Canada's economic action plan have provided significant support for jobs and growth across our country.

We would provide an additional $50 million to the youth employment strategy to assist more young people in gaining tangible skills and experience.

The board conducted a campaign to discredit him by disclosing his confidential medical information on more than one occasion.

There was talk of new disciplinary measures, and a privacy action plan was announced with great fanfare.

I say “so-called” because it quickly became apparent that the bill would do little to protect Canada's immigration system. At that time, the entire immigration stakeholder community was shocked that the government was reversing the prudent measures of the Balanced Refugee Reform Act, and just months before that act was supposed to come into force.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871632">The bill has become a symbol of all that is wrong with the Conservative government. It was born out of fear, ideology and a complete distaste for evidence and input from opposition parties and stakeholders. In fact, the bill stands alone in its total lack of support from every conceivable part of the immigration community: churches, lawyers, pediatricians, settlement services, immigration consultants, immigrants and refugees themselves have all roundly condemned the bill as imbalanced, misguided and ineffective.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871633">The parts of the bill that deal with human smuggling came from a fearmongering political opportunism practised by the <Affiliation DbId="128705" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism</Affiliation> and the <Affiliation DbId="170392" Type="2">Minister of Public Safety</Affiliation> following the arrival of two boats on our shores carrying bona fide refugees from war-torn Sri Lanka.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871634">The rest of the bill is simply a comprehensive dismantling of the Balanced Refugee Reform Act, which was passed with all-party support in the minority Parliament of 2010 in a spirit of co-operation and a mutual recognition that the system needed to be streamlined.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871635">Indeed, the <Affiliation DbId="128705" Type="4">Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism</Affiliation> praised that bill, saying the opposition amendments made our refugee determination system “fairer and faster”, words he now disavows and contradicts.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871636">The laundry list of things that are wrong with the bill is long and serious. They includes mandatory detention of refugees, including children; ministerial power to designate safe countries without any independent oversight; denial of appeal to designated refugee claimants, which is a fundamental part of natural justice; unacceptably short timelines for filing refugee claims, a measure that would lead to more rejections; and denying family reunification for over five years to many refugees.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871637">Ultimately the bill is about accepting fewer refugees. It goes against decades of tradition of welcoming the most vulnerable people in the world to our country. I think of the vibrant Vietnamese community in my riding of <Affiliation DbId="170261" Type="2">Vancouver Kingsway</Affiliation>, almost all of whom came here on boats in the 1970s. I think also of the Jewish community, Somali Canadians, Roma. These groups, and others like them, embody the tradition of refugee resettlement in Canada, a tradition that the government is shunning.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871638">I would like to highlight how the bill was handled and what it says about the government.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871639">Once again, the bill illustrates the omnibus approach to legislation that we see repeatedly. Measures that on their own are distasteful to most Canadians are bundled together in one bill and rammed through Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871640">At committee, we heard from lawyers who spoke about how the bill would violate our Constitution. They spoke about how the bill would violate our international obligations. They detailed how the bill would mandate timelines that would be impossible to meet while protecting people's rights to a fair hearing at the same time.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871641">People on the front lines spoke about how the bill would further traumatize already traumatized people by imposing detention upon them and separating them from their families.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871642">We heard Roma Canadians talk about the real persecution they face and how insulting and misguided it is of the minister to constantly refer to European refugee claimants as “bogus”.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871643">Evidence of similar legislation from countries like Australia that shows that these types of policies just do not work was flatly ignored.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871644">People who work with refugees every day told us how the bill would hurt refugees, their families and our communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871645">Throughout the whole process, the government and the minister have ignored, belittled and chastised experts and stakeholders with a level of ignorance and arrogance that is unworthy of public office-holders.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871646"><Document DbId="5383493">The bill </Document>remains punitive, mean-spirited and ineffective.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871647">Why is the government moving forward with Bill <Document DbId="5383493" Type="3">C-31</Document>?</ParaText></Content></Intervention><Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Dykstra" id="7590270"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="170853" Type="18">Mr. Rick Dykstra (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2871648">Madam Speaker, I heard more of an election speech and an ideological perspective from the member. He is certainly allowed to do that. That is what late shows are all about.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871649">However, for many on the opposition benches, the truth merely gets in the way of a good speech or a good story, and I think that is what has happened here. I do not think there is any problem with the way our Westminster model of Parliament works in Canada. It is a government's responsibility to introduce legislation; it is the opposition's responsibility to ensure that legislation is put to the scrutiny of the parliamentary process.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871650">In fact, the member failed to reveal two very important facts.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871651">The first is with regard to Bill <Document DbId="4383517" Type="3">C-11</Document>. That bill, the refugee reform act, indeed passed through this House with unanimous support. Today 80% to 90% of that bill is still in effect, and in fact was included in Bill <Document DbId="5383493" Type="3">C-31</Document>. However, in terms of refugee applications, the problem is that there was not enough to do what would be necessary to make the system successful, proper, prudent and fair.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871652">The steps implemented in Bill <Document DbId="4383517" Type="3">C-11</Document> included, and still include, an additional 2,500 refugees here in Canada on a yearly basis. My friend across the way mentioned that we are going to have fewer refugees in Canada now; I can tell him, and he knows, that there will be 2,500 more refugees in Canada yearly. He also knows that over 60% of the refugee applications that come forward in this country actually fail. Our overburdened system has a number of individuals in the backlog, and many more people fail through the system than succeed.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871653">Our purpose in bringing Bill <Document DbId="5383493" Type="3">C-31</Document> forward is to repair a very broken system. Bill <Document DbId="4383517" Type="3">C-11</Document> goes a long way to repairing that system; Bill <Document DbId="5383493" Type="3">C-31</Document>would complete what needs to happen.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871654">My friend across the way talks a lot about fairness, but there were 5,800 more refugee claims from the European Union in 2011 than there were from Africa or Asia. The total percentage of applications for refugee status in our country from the EU, which is made up of democratic states, democratic countries, is 23% more than from Africa and Asia. What is really interesting is that 95% of those European Union applications are either withdrawn or rejected, while virtually all that come forward are unsuccessful.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2871655"> Bill <Document DbId="4383517" Type="3">C-11</Document> does not address this specific issue in a way that would fix this broken system.That is what Bill <Document DbId="5383493" Type="3">C-31</Document> has to do.</ParaText><ParaText id="2871656">My colleague across the way and I have worked together very closely for the last year in a very positive way. We have our differences, but we worked very closely together. If he and his party are suggesting that the current system and this opportunity for people to take advantage of our system are somehow acceptable, that will not happen in this country. That is because one thing Canadians understand is fairness. Canadians want to help refugees. They want to bring them to this country and they want to give them another opportunity. However, the one thing Canadians will not have is people taking advantage of our system, which would not only hurt Canadians but also hurt those who are truly trying to come to this country to seek refugee status.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
