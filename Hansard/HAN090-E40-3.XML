						</PersonSpeaking><Content><ProceduralText TocType="TPC" id="1">Bill C-36. Third reading</ProceduralText><ParaText id="2129422"> moved that Bill <Document DbId="4591264" Type="3">C-36, An Act respecting the safety of consumer products</Document>, be read the third time and passed. </ParaText><ParaText id="2129423">She said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to stand in the House for third reading of Bill <Document DbId="4591264" Type="3">C-36, An Act respecting the safety of consumer products</Document>. </ParaText><ParaText id="2129424">I know, from discussions with my colleagues, that we all recognize the need to modernize product safety legislation in this country. </ParaText><ParaText id="2129425">The Hazardous Products Act is 40-year-old legislation that was developed at a time when consumer product marketplaces were very different. At the time, a greater number of products were produced domestically. Today, many of the products available for sale to Canadians are imported, supply chains are complex and innovation drives rapid product change and development.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129426">Our current legislation requires us to develop regulations and prohibitions as a basis for ensuring product safety. Because of this, Health Canada has remained focused on particular products or product classes that are reviewed through a targeted sampling and testing program. New regulations continue to be developed to address risks as they emerge. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2129427">The regulatory process is a lengthy one. It leaves us with few tools to quickly address serious product safety issues as they emerge. My department has not had the tools to act quickly to prevent product-related incidents. In Canada, we have a post-market consumer product safety regime, which means that we do not certify new products coming into the market. A post-market regime makes sense for consumer products and helps ensure a free flow of goods but it demands a modern legislative framework. </ParaText><ParaText id="2129428">Where we have regulations in place, products must meet the requirements they describe, but there are thousands of products that are not regulated. We do not have the mandatory incident reporting in Canada. There is currently no obligation for industry to report product-related problems. We have no authority at this time to require testing or that test results be provided to ensure compliance with our legislation. When we do identify a serious risk with a product, we do not have the powers of mandatory recall.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129429">While it is true that we have a very co-operative industry in Canada, an industry that strives to be compliant, the fact that we cannot rely on mandatory powers of recall frequently requires us to undertake lengthy negotiations for volunteer recall, even if the severity of the situation demands swift action.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2129430">My colleagues in this chamber know that this legislation is close to my heart. I have travelled throughout Canada to discuss product safety with parents and stakeholders. I have travelled internationally to promote our work on product safety with foreign jurisdictions. I am a member of a government that recognizes the need to increase funding for product safety and put our money where our mouth is with the food and consumer product safety action plan.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129431">Through the food and consumer safety action plan, we are doubling the number of inspectors throughout Canada. We are increasing our funding for outreach to ensure that industry understands its obligations and that consumers have the information they need to make good product choices. </ParaText><ParaText id="2129432">We are also building an efficient system to support the requirements in this legislation for mandatory reporting of serious product-related incidents and we are increasing our work in the development of standards. Standards will be an important tool in the future for ensuring product safety and for helping industry to address risk. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2129433">These tools are putting us on a strong footing for a system built on active prevention, targeted oversight and rapid response. They will support the hard work that has already been done by Health Canada in the areas of product safety and bring us up to date, not only with what is required in the modern global marketplace, but also with the product safety regimes of our major trading partners. This legislation is an important part of that plan.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129434">What would this legislation help to achieve? The proposed act focuses on three areas: active prevention, targeted oversight, and rapid response.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129435">I will first speak to the active prevention. The proposed consumer products safety act would introduce a general prohibition against the manufacture, importation, advertisement or sale of consumer products that pose an unreasonable danger to human health or safety. The new legislation would allow Health Canada to address consumer products in Canada that pose an unreasonable danger to the health or safety of the public. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2129436">When I appeared before the Standing Committee on Health, we discussed the emerging problem of cadmium in children's jewellery and examples of how the general prohibitions might be used right now if they were in place. Health Canada has worked hard to address product safety in Canada. The work that has been done to help ensure that children's products are safe is one of the best examples of this.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129437">As many of my colleagues in the House know, Health Canada currently has some of the strictest limits in the world on the use of lead in children's products. It is a toxic if ingested. My department regularly enforces these lead limits, and officials are also on alert for the presence of other heavy metals in children's products. That is how we discovered the presence of cadmium in children's jewellery.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129438"> Cadmium is also toxic. Because it is cheap material, it is being used to make children's jewellery. If we could be certain that these items were only going to be worn by young people there might not be a problem. However, as many of us know from our own children, it can be a challenge to keep items out of their mouth. When swallowed, cadmium can cause a range of ill health effects. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2129439">Because there are currently no regulated limits on the use of cadmium in children's jewellery, the department has exercised the limits of its authority under the Hazardous Products Act by releasing advisories to alert parents about these items and by asking the industry for a voluntary ban on its use.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129440"> It is worthwhile to consider how we might be managing this emerging problem with cadmium if the Canada consumer product safety act were in place. The knowledge that under certain circumstances cadmium causes an unreasonable danger would provide us with the basis to use the general prohibition that is included in this legislation. Our inspectors could be working right now to remove unsafe cadmium-filled children's jewellery from stores. The department would not necessarily have to wait up to two years for the development of regulations in order to have the ability to act. We could be issuing recalls for these products if we found that industry was not willing to act swiftly on a voluntary basis. The general prohibition is an important provision for helping to prevent consumer product incidents before they occur.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129441">In terms of active prevention, another important provision in this legislation is the updated fines. Compliance and enforcement would be strengthened through maximum fines of up to $5 million for some of the worst offences or more for offences committed knowingly or recklessly.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2129442">The current fines under the Hazardous Products Act could easily be perceived as simply a cost of doing business. The new maximum fines are a step up from the current maximum penalty of $1 million. They will be an important deterrent and they will bring us into step with other major trading partners.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129443">What about targeted oversight? Targeted oversight is especially important in the context of products where the risk may not yet be fully understood or that pose the greatest potential hazard to the public. </ParaText><ParaText id="2129444">The proposed act would give the minister of health the authority to order a manufacturer or importer to conduct safety tests and to submit results to the ministry in order to verify compliance with the act. It would also require suppliers to notify Health Canada of defects and of serious product-related incidents. These would include near miss incidents where injury has been averted.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129445">Let us consider cribs. At the moment, as many colleagues know, my officials are consulting on whether we should ban traditional drop-side cribs in this country. We have developed this proposal and we are talking to Canadians about it because we know from mandatory reporting in the United States that these cribs can cause safety risks.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2129446">Our colleagues in the United States have been very generous with information they gather through their mandatory reporting. They have worked co-operatively with us on recalls and they assisted us in determining whether problematic products have been sold in Canada. We work with them on a daily basis.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129447">We look forward to having access to our own incident data generated as a result of the provisions for mandatory reporting. This is a provision that will be critical for us as we transition to product safety programs built on the strategic intelligence it generates. </ParaText><ParaText id="2129448">The proposed legislation also includes measures to allow for a rapid response to problems once they are identified. We must not forget that we always hope to avoid problems and prevent injuries related to consumer products, and that is why we are investing in active prevention and targeted oversight. However, we have a post-market regime for consumer products in Canada and we have almost as many entry points for products into this country as we have products. They are coming to Canada from around the world.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2129449">Under the proposed new act, Health Canada would be able to move quickly and decisively when a problem occurs. This would be done through the ability to order recalls of unsafe consumer products and by requiring suppliers to maintain accurate records to enable quick tracking of products.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129450"> Health Canada will work closely with industry to ensure this legislation is understood and properly implemented. Workshops and other information-sharing opportunities will be used to promote awareness of the new provisions and requirements.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129451">Through Bill <Document DbId="4591264" Type="3">C-36</Document>, our government is demonstrating its commitment to consumer product safety. We are demonstrating our desire to meet Canadians' expectations by proposing action Canadians want and need.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129452">The bill before us today reflects a cumulative wisdom of both Houses of Parliament and extensive long-term consultation on the part of Health Canada. When it came before this House previously as Bill <Document DbId="3630973" Type="3">C-6</Document>, the standing committee heard from government witnesses and from 33 other witnesses representing over 24 organizations. In total, five separate sessions were devoted to review and discuss former Bill <Document DbId="3630973" Type="3">C-6</Document>, two of which were extended. In those sessions, all voices were heard and all opinions were closely considered. The results of the committee's hard work was an amended bill that reflected the underlying policy intent of the bill, as well as other key aspects of concern to some witnesses.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2129453">Our government's amendments included delivering on a commitment to make it crystal clear that natural health products would not be regulated by this act. The opposition amendments address two key areas: consultation and information-sharing. When the government reintroduced the bill, the <Document DbId="4591264" Type="3">Canada Consumer Product Safety Act</Document>, in June of this year, it retained those amendments.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129454">In its previous form as Bill <Document DbId="3630973" Type="3">C-6, Canada Consumer Product Safety Act</Document>, it was subject to considerable scrutiny in other places. Our colleagues were concerned that perhaps the legislation provided too broad a scope for inspector powers. Before we reintroduced this legislation last June, we worked hard to analyze those concerns. </ParaText><ParaText id="2129455">Of the six changes incorporated into Bill <Document DbId="4591264" Type="3">C-36</Document> before its reintroduction in June, three spoke to concerns about the perceived scope of inspector powers and four spoke to concerns raised by opposition senators. We removed the words “and they are not liable for doing so” from the provisions that allow inspectors to pass over private property. We defined storage so that it would be clear that it would not apply to goods stored by individuals for personal use.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129456">In Bill <Document DbId="4591264" Type="3">C-36</Document>, the minister is now made expressly accountable for the authority for recalls and other orders. And, in responding to concerns about the review of orders, the bill now sets out a 30-day review period.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2129457">The government also adjusted the legislation to improve the wording in the bill, “provisions for an advisory body”, in order to clarify what is meant by public advice. Last, the government added the prohibition on BPA and baby bottles.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129458">We heard from colleagues in the upper chamber that these changes largely address their concerns, but after the legislation was introduced in June, they remained concerned that some of the technical amendments they had made to the bill, when it was before them as Bill C-6, had not been incorporated into Bill <Document DbId="4591264" Type="3">C-36</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129459">We want this legislation to pass, and so we have again worked hard to address these concerns. That is why the government introduced four amendments at clause-by-clause consideration of Bill <Document DbId="4591264" Type="3">C-36</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129460">Some colleagues have asked that the requirements of the Privacy Act be made explicit in this legislation. We have done this with the amendment to clause 15. </ParaText><ParaText id="2129461">We have also incorporated a series of technical amendments to address and distinguish the two Houses of Parliament. Some of these amendments address the unique nature of each place and the fact that their committees are structured differently. We have amended clause 38 to address those concerns. </ParaText><ParaText id="2129462">We have also amended clause 39 to ensure that a timely rationale is provided in cases where certain regulations are made without being laid before Parliament. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2129463">We have amended clause 60 to address the concerns raised in the other place that clause 60 lacked clarity about the role of the minister in reviewing a notice of violation. This change required a further technical amendment to subclause 56(1).</ParaText><ParaText id="2129464">Given these changes and the committee's previous close scrutiny of this legislation, I am pleased to see the bill reported back to this House with only a small number of amendments.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129465">It is my sincere hope that this House will pass Bill <Document DbId="4591264" Type="3">C-36</Document>, and that it will reflect the efforts many people have made to address all the concerns. As I stand at third reading today, I feel optimistic that we will soon have dramatically improved consumer product safety in this country. </ParaText><ParaText id="2129466">As I speak today, I remain hopeful that this House, in its wisdom, will pass this legislation. I am hopeful that this legislation will rapidly become law. It is my wish that this bill be afforded a smooth passage.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2129467">I would like to address one last issue pertaining to this legislation. It is critically important to make the distinction, as this legislation does, between administrative proceedings and proceedings in the criminal courts. Under the administrative monetary penalty system, a person or supplier that has been found to be out of compliance with the act or regulations could be issued an order to take an appropriate corrective measure. If that person or supplier does not take the appropriate action, he or she may be subject to a notice of violation. If a notice is issued, the person or supplier will be subject to the monetary penalties under the administrative monetary penalty system.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129468">This system encourages compliance and addresses non-compliance with orders for recall and other corrective measures. These measures can be an effective tool for gaining cooperation from regulated industry. Violations can result in an administrative process that is more responsive and less expensive than prosecution in the criminal courts. A criminal record would not result from a violation.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129469">I will be watching the progress of this bill closely. I will continue to meet with parents and stakeholders to talk about the importance of having a consumer product safety regime. I set high standards on officials to develop effective, efficient, reliable systems to support the new provisions in the bill.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2129470">As I wrap up my remarks, I would like to pause to consider the hard work that has gone into this legislation and into getting it to this point in the legislative process. The parliamentary secretary, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128268" Type="2">Oshawa</Affiliation>, has worked tirelessly to support the goal of passing the <Document DbId="4591264" Type="3">Canada Consumer Product Safety Act</Document>. To him I extend my thanks.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129471">I would also like to thank the members of the Standing Committee on Health for their hard work on this bill. Every member of the Standing Committee on Health voiced support for this legislation, and demonstrated this support by making the bill a priority and focusing on its swift passage.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="20">(1020)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2129472">I therefore want to thank my colleagues on the committee for their support, collaborative approach, and shared concern for the safety of consumer products in Canada. I also want to thank all the Canadians and stakeholders I have met who share my desire for new product safety legislation and the many benefits it will bring. I look forward to their ongoing support for bringing this bill through the full legislative process to full implementation.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129473">To conclude, I want to stress that Canada's current consumer product legislation is 40 years old. We have fallen behind other jurisdictions. An update is overdue and the bill before us today benefits from a wide diversity of experts' views.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129474">Canadians can be assured that the government—</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

But I will not do that, because we are finally at the point of getting this bill past third reading in the House, once again.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129478">I would like to come back to clause 37, which deals with regulations. This is an important clause that gives rather extensive discretionary powers to the minister.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129479">How will the minister use these discretionary powers, and does she plan on determining whether or not a product is dangerous? What criteria will she set for recalling one item rather than another? How will she decide not to recall a product for some reason?

They would have to be based on investigations by inspectors and on consultation with the industry. When a mandatory recall is decided upon, a recommendation would be made to the minister, at which time the minister would use the legislative provision covering mandatory recalls, which we do not currently have.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

The amendments opposed in the Senate at that stage, in my view, compromised the intent of the legislation. When we re-introduced the legislation in June, we were able to address some of their other concerns as well.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129486">As the member knows very well, we have been dealing with a global economic downturn, and we have been focusing on trying to address it. It is equally important to respond to the global economic situation. </ParaText><ParaText id="2129487">We introduced legislation in June. I am asking the member for her support in passing this legislation, so that we can have consumer product legislation that would protect the health and safety of Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129488">On a final note, in response to her shot with regard to injuries, injuries have occurred. There were incidents in Canada where children died in an unsafe crib. There has been an incident where a child lost a finger. These are real incidents that have occurred in Canada. That is why it is so important to update our 40-year-old legislation so that Canada will be at the same level as other trading countries such as the United States.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

This mechanism would give us the information necessary to investigate possible incidents to determine whether a product is safe or not.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129494">If it is determined that a product is unsafe, we would work with industry to remove that unsafe product from the market. As it is right now, industry lacks a mechanism for co-operating with us and we do not have the mandatory provisions required to remove unsafe products from the market.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129495"> Cadmium is an example that we recently dealt with. At present, all we can do is tell Canadians that cadmium is in the market. I think as parents and consumers we often make the assumption that the products on our shelves are safe. For me as a parent, it was really an eye-opener to find out that this is not always the case.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2129496">This legislation would modernize us. It would give us the ability to respond quickly, remove products from the market, and monitor incidents in Canada. I believe it is also in industry's interest to ensure that their products are safe. They will be able to do safety testing and will be allowed to share that information with us to determine what products are safe.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129497">Once this bill is adopted, our legislation is going to be much improved.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

As you are well aware, a number of Canadians were deeply concerned about certain provisions contained in the bill as passed by the House of Commons. They considered that the bill went too far, for example in granting relatively low-level government officials the power to enter any private home where a consumer product is “stored”...in order to “verify compliance” with the Act or regulations--which could include verifying compliance with labelling requirements. There was concern that the bill allowed inspectors to enter or pass over private property without any liability for damage they negligently caused. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2129517"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">These provisions seem particularly strange in view of your Government's recent position on the supposedly intrusive nature of the mandatory long-form census.

Minister, this too was a false statement. No amendment passed by the Senate Committee required any Canadian – baby or adult – to die before there could be a recall. I suspect that this was little more than fear-mongering, designed solely to pressure the Senate.

The Auditor General produced a report four years ago that revealed several problems and also highlighted the risks related to consumer products. We cannot wait any longer to move forward with this bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129854">Canada is not the only country to be tightening up its legislation. I want to talk about what happened south of the border, in the United States. On August 14, 2008, the then president, George W. Bush, signed the Danny Keysar Child Product Safety Notification Act. This act set new, modern standards and strengthened the legislation on toy safety. Thus, the American agency responsible for overseeing the safety of consumer products was given measures that enabled it to have better control over toys. This legislation assigned more responsibilities, expanded authority and granted related powers to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the CPSC.</ParaText>

The law also proposed an increase in the agency's budget every year until 2015, as well as an increase in staff of at least 500 employees by 2013 in order to effectively enforce the new safety standards.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129856">On September 10, 2009, the chair of the CPSC, Inez Tenenbaum, testified before the Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection Subcommittee, saying that she intends to make her agency a world leader in consumer protection.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129857">With that statement in mind, I hope that it is also the government's intention, following the passage of this new bill, to see to it that we, too, are leaders in terms of consumer protection by ensuring that our consumers are buying safe products.</ParaText>

To the Bloc Québécois, it is clear that we cannot leave it up to industry alone to ensure that the products it puts on the market are safe within the meaning of the law. In committee, we asked whether the number of inspectors was sufficient, and this is what Athana Mentzelopoulos said:</ParaText>

We want to go where the work is, essentially. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2129880"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">In my own travels recently, as the new DG, I visited with the regions. We do not necessarily have a uniform number of inspectors associated with each region. In British Columbia there is a lot of volume with imports, and we need to make sure we are resourced appropriately. It is the same in Ontario; a considerable extent of industry is found in Ontario. Obviously we would have—and this is the case—more resources in Ontario than we might find in areas where, for example, there is less industry, less import activity. In Quebec as well we have obviously larger numbers; it correlates to going where the work is and making sure that we are addressing the need.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>

We are doubling that capacity. By the fifth year of the action plan, 2012-13, in fact we will have overall doubled the entire complement in consumer product safety. We actually will have increased by about 125 employees.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2129883"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">I think it's important to recognize that we also are hiring more analysts to do testing and verification at our laboratory. With the introduction of the general prohibition, there's going to be a lot more research, hazard evaluations, hazard assessments, risk assessments. We're bringing in mandatory incident reporting. We need to have people sitting behind computers triaging the data, analyzing the data. These are all individuals beyond and in addition to the inspectors.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2129884"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">So it's a fairly broad complement of new employees. Inspectors are obviously very critical. We have those who would be devoted to risk assessment, those devoted to standards development. I think also a very critical piece, given the post-market regime of consumer product safety in Canada and worldwide, is the critical importance of outreach. There are also resources and new staff devoted to outreach. That includes outreach to industry in terms of understanding their obligations, as well as outreach to consumers, since we all have a role to play. As regulator, obviously, as government we have a role to play. Consumers have a role to play. Obviously manufacturers and industry have a role to play.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2129885"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">So it's much, much broader than just inspectors.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2129886">Based on Mr. Ianiro's comments, it is clear that we will stay on top of this issue. We will make sure that it is not government funding that determines the number of employees responsible for inspections and for proper implementation of the bill, but vice versa. And once we know what is needed on the ground in order to do the work correctly, we need to ensure that the division carrying out the organization and implementation of inspections has enough staff.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129887">As I said earlier, the entire burden cannot be put on the industry. It is obviously in the industry's interest to not have any products recalled or any nasty incidents reported, but the government has the primary responsibility to ensure that this legislation is adopted by Parliament—and quickly, I hope—so that it can be correctly enforced. </ParaText><ParaText id="2129888">I will not have time to talk about two other questions that we had asked about the government's interpretation of the preamble, notably concerning the precautionary principle.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2129889">In any case, I would invite citizens who wish to enquire about these answers to do so by visiting the parliamentary website and consulting the transcripts of the committee debates concerning Bill <Document DbId="4591264" Type="3">C-36</Document>.</ParaText>

During the health committee's work last spring, we spent only one meeting examining the whole issue of nanotechnology, its growing use and the repercussions this new technology can have on human health.

So this bill updates the legislation. The committee and this Parliament will have every opportunity, I have no doubt, to make other improvements through other means. For instance, the member mentioned counterfeit products. There is also the question of labelling, in order to ensure that when consumers purchase a product, they know exactly what is in it.

Judy Wasylycia-Leis, my former colleague, the former member for Winnipeg North, has been on this file for years, advocating for stronger consumer protection. I know that our leader has raised it with the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>, and in the 40th Parliament, this session, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128626" Type="2">Sudbury</Affiliation> has been a strong advocate for changes to consumer protection laws that would actually result in protection for consumers.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129909">As we have heard a few times in this House, the previous legislation is 40 years old. It is time for a change. It is time to catch up and modernize. All parties are in agreement that this legislation is desperately needed.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129910">However, that does not necessarily ensure that product safety is going to be ensured in Canada. This legislation is going to need to be enforced in order for it be effective. As the member for <Affiliation DbId="128453" Type="2">Elmwood—Transcona</Affiliation> has said, there are serious questions about whether or not enforcement is actually going to happen and whether or not sufficient resources are going to be put into this bill.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2129911">This is a good bill. I am proud to support it. Our party is proud to support it. I am proud that it is going to the other place and may soon get royal assent. We are hopeful that it will be soon. However, we need to stop and think critically about whether this bill is just a shell being carried into effect for show, or whether it will actually provide protection for consumers.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129912">There are a number of reasons to think that the government might abdicate its responsibility on this bill, should it be passed through the other place. The reason is this: despite the fact that the legislation is their own, and despite their repeated statements that this legislation is important to them, the Conservatives have dragged their feet. There is no other way of putting this. They have dragged their feet in introducing this legislation to the session. Previously, they prorogued Parliament and killed similar legislation, not once but twice. There was significant delay in getting this to first and second reading.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129913">Now we are rushing it through. I think that is fair. We know what is in this bill. It has been to committee before. We have debated it before. However, it has taken a long time for us to get to this point.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2129914">Even though we are at third reading now, we have to ask why has this process has taken so long. Why has the government not acted quickly on this legislation, when there have been many opportunities to do so? I think it demonstrates a level of unwillingness to emphasize the safety of Canadians. It is disconcerting that so much time and energy, resources and effort, were put into trying to eliminate the gun registry, while product safety was put on the back burner.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129915">The member for <Affiliation DbId="128510" Type="2">Portage—Lisgar</Affiliation> is driving around in a minivan saying “End the registry”. In fact, that minivan was idling outside of Confederation Building the other day, so clearly they do not care about the environment either. There is no minivan saying “protect consumers”. There are no flyers going into other ridings, no radio or TV ads saying that we should protect consumers. All we get is foot-dragging.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129916">Over the last month, we have received alarming reports about Health Canada's failure to warn parents about the risks of cadmium in children's jewellery. Health Canada testing showed unacceptable cadmium levels much earlier than we had previously known. Some of the products that they tested had cadmium levels of 93%, and yet the government delayed letting Canadians know about this. This is children's jewellery, and we all know what children do with small objects. It goes right in the mouth.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2129917">Health Canada has actually stated that cadmium is more toxic than lead. Testing that revealed unacceptable cadmium levels occurred in the 2009-10 testing cycle. But that was not the first time it was discovered. The previous testing cycle also revealed unacceptable cadmium levels. Health Canada advisories until now have not mentioned any of these test results. It is hard to imagine. These tests were on children's jewellery.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129918">Our children were at danger of ingesting cadmium from these products because of the government's lack of transparency on testing and a lack of public education on cadmium's dangers. This is just plain wrong. It is irresponsible. I cannot understand why the government would not have mentioned these test results, especially when there was a 93% level in some products containing cadmium. The risks were inherently clear.</ParaText>

It is going to require an adequate number of inspectors and a team that is able to respond effectively to product safety concerns. They will have to respond in such a way that every Canadian will be kept safe from dangerous products.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129921">It goes without saying that the government has done poorly on similar files, like food inspection. We should be questioning the Conservatives' willingness to fund product safety protections adequately. So it is a step forward, but without teeth. Without the systems in place to carry out the intended functions, it is going to be a colossal failure.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129922">We will see the government trumpet the bill's passage and send a message to Canadians that their products are safe, but this message needs to be backed up with funding. It needs to be backed up with resources. Otherwise, we will be giving Canadians a false sense of security.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2129923">I stand here representing the voices of consumers from coast to coast to coast. I thank the government for finally bringing in this legislation, and I ask that they commit the resources to enforce it. Otherwise, the bill will be meaningless. I desperately hope that two, five, or ten years from now we are not lamenting a failure to act and saying “I told you so”.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129924">I was reading the newspaper today and there was a quote by James Orbinski. It was not about this bill. It was about the access to medicines regime, Bill <Document DbId="4328807" Type="4">C-393</Document>. It was brought forward by my former colleague, Judy Wasylycia-Leis, but is now being handled by my colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128491" Type="2">Windsor West</Affiliation>. Bill C-393, if passed, would facilitate selling developing countries generic drugs still under patent. It would fix the 2005 regime that was created by the Martin government. The bill should be supported by all members who believe in justice and fairness.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2129925">James Orbinski is the co-founder of Dignitas and a world-renowned health activist. In referring to Bill C393, he inadvertently said something related to Bill <Document DbId="4591264" Type="3">C-36</Document>: “Right now CAMR is a rhetorical success and a practical failure. Bill C-393 is an effort to make CAMR a practical success”. I read that and thought of Bill <Document DbId="4591264" Type="3">C-36</Document>. We must not let it become a rhetorical success but a practical failure. We need to ensure that there are resources in place.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129926">I talked about justice and fairness. The bill should also raise levels of justice and fairness for low-income Canadians. It goes without saying that dangerous products touch the lives of socio-economically disadvantaged Canadians proportionately more than the rest of society. Cheap products rely on cheaper manufacturing processes, and these products are wreaking havoc on the lives of people who cannot afford better choices. These people are poorly positioned to deal with health consequences or with wages lost due to taking time off from work to care for themselves or their loved ones.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2129927"> I believe strongly that product safety should not just be the prerogative of the rich. This issue goes to the heart of the equality principles held by Canadians, and product safety legislation should play a central role in moving toward economic justice in our country.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129928">I would like to touch on an issue that I do not think has been raised in the House very often. Sometimes when I am out in the community I am approached by people who say that they have problems with Bill <Document DbId="4591264" Type="3">C-36</Document>.

That is why the <Affiliation DbId="128707" Type="4">Minister of Health</Affiliation> last year declared that April 2 would be known as World Autism Awareness Day across Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129948">I remember so clearly when I joined the Waterloo County School Board in 1978 when one of our superintendents mentioned the word autism. To be honest, I had not even heard the word before that time. I remember how our officials grappled to address the needs of the children and their families who were suffering with autism. Since that time, it is obvious that we have come a long way in addressing this issue but that we have a long way to go.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129949">Today, this government is pleased to have the opportunity to reiterate this important commitment by expressing our support for Bill <Document DbId="4653461" Type="4">S-211, An Act respecting World Autism Awareness Day</Document>. </ParaText><ParaText id="2129950">Bill <Document DbId="4653461" Type="4">S-211</Document> was recently amended to clarify certain information presented in the preamble. These amendments preserve the intent of the bill while simultaneously promoting the importance of disseminating clear, consistent and accurate information about autism, an objective to which this government is committed.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2129951">The impacts of autism are wide-ranging for individuals and families affected by the condition. ASD can present lifelong challenges. For researchers, ASD is particularly complex as it affects each individual differently. A great deal of valuable research has already been done to uncover the causes of ASD, as well as the most effective treatments and long-term implications of this disorder. However, further research is required in order to gain a more solid understanding of this complicated condition. </ParaText><ParaText id="2129952">This is why the federal government is committed to supporting an enhanced autism evidence base and has devoted substantial resources in this regard. For example, over the last several years our government has invested over $35 million for autism-related research projects through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. </ParaText><ParaText id="2129953">In addition, the Public Health Agency of Canada and the Department of Health have contributed to improving autism evidence and awareness. On that note, I would like to share with the House today some recent activities in the area of autism research which have been supported by the health portfolio.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129954">Between 2007-08 and 2008-09, Health Canada invested $125,000 for CAIRN, which stands for Canadian Autism Intervention Research Network, a group of researchers, clinicians, parents and policy-makers dedicated to ASD research as a way to find better treatment and diagnostic techniques.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2129955">A key aspect of CAIRN's work is its website, which disseminates up-to-date information on autism in a format and language that is useful to those who need it most: individuals and families affected by autism. I am pleased to tell the House that federal funding supported the update and translation of this trusted website, making this valuable resource available in both official languages.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129956">This government also supported CAIRN to host the 2009 CAIRN conference, which provided an important forum for researchers, clinicians, policy-makers and those affected by ASD to come together to share new research, different points of view, challenges and stories with a view to raising awareness about autism. It was also at this conference that the preliminary and exciting findings of the Pathways in ASD study were shared.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129957">The Pathways in ASD study is a one of kind collaborative research study that focuses on understanding how children with ASD grow and develop over time. The Canadian Institutes for Health Research is one of the funders of this exciting initiative, led by researchers from McMaster University who are working to understand the different developmental pathways that children with ASD follow and to identify predictors of good outcomes that can be used to develop new intervention programs.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2129958">To date, approximately 440 children from five different locations across Canada have been enrolled in this study, making it the largest of its kind in the world. It is significant to note that Canada has the largest of its kind of study related to autism research.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129959">The study will examine a number of factors, including social competence, communication skills, behaviour and the ability to function independently that influence areas of development related to the child, the family and the community as a whole.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="05">(1305)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2129960">The results of this study will be a valuable resource in ensuring the best outcomes for children with ASD, both through the development of new programs and interventions, and by furthering our understanding of their needs and their strengths.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129961">I understand that this project has been designed to fill important evidence gaps on developmental pathways of children with ASD. The Pathways in ASD project will also provide important evidence-based information for policy-makers and researchers alike.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129962">CIHR is also supporting a $1.4 million strategic training grant in autism research, led by Dr. Eric Fombonne from McGill University, which will contribute to training the upcoming generation of autism researchers and will aim to uncover the mysteries of autism.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129963">Building on the strategic training program in autism research that trained over 40 Ph.D. and post-doctoral students conducting autism research in various disciplines, from molecular genetics to outcome intervention studies, this latest project will expand the program.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129964">The strategic training grant will address the pressing needs of Canadians affected by autism, as well as their families and service providers, by building research capacity in this area.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2129965"> In addition, CIHR is investing in autism research at the University of Alberta, where researchers are examining the early development of autism by following infants at increased risk of the disorder because they are siblings of children who already have autism. The ultimate goal is earlier identification and treatment. Research such as this is building our understanding of ASD and our capacity to treat ASD.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129966">Furthermore, along with Genome Canada, CIHR provides support to the autism genome project. This initiative will help to increase our understanding of the genetics of ASD which could, in the long term, lead to earlier diagnoses.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129967">While research is an important aspect of the work being done to better understand ASD, another pillar of knowledge is in the area of surveillance.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129968">In order to better understand the progression rates of autism in Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada is establishing a national surveillance program for autism. This program will join the agency's other health surveillance activities for chronic diseases, injury, infectious diseases, and perinatal health.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129969">In the autism surveillance program, the agency will work with health professionals, researchers, and voluntary organizations to analyze and report the trends and patterns of occurrence of autism in Canada. The resulting information will be provided to governments, health professionals, and affected families.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2129970">It is important to remember that all stakeholders in ASD want the same thing, better treatments and earlier diagnosis for those affected by ASD, so that ultimately they can all enjoy a better outcome.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129971">To this end, our government is working with partners and stakeholders to promote autism awareness and is investing in activities which support a stronger evidence base. The more we share, the more we gain. By translating discoveries and knowledge into new, effective, evidence-based therapies, we can provide true hope for Canadians living with autism and their families.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129972">I want to point out some of the partners that are working together to give evidence of how this sharing is working. They include the Public Health Agency of Canada, the Canadian Autism Intervention Research Network, Pathways in ASD, Canadian Institutes for Health Research, McMaster University, McGill University, University of Alberta, and Genome Canada, among others.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129973">As we continue to invest in better knowledge of this condition, the Government of Canada remains committed to ensuring that this knowledge is passed on to Canadians because enhanced awareness promotes understanding, acceptance, collaboration, and progress. Research and awareness go hand in hand. In declaring April 2 as World Autism Awareness Day and supporting Bill <Document DbId="4653461" Type="4">S-211</Document>, this government has further contributed to this important objective.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129974">I urge all members of the House to give their enthusiastic support to this bill, which gives one more glimmer of hope to those families dealing with the challenges of autism.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I think that all members of this House will join in supporting this laudable piece of legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129976">The member spent a lot of time talking about the government's support for research and increasing the knowledge base around autism, which I think is a very laudable goal and I congratulate the government for that. However, there is a deep deficit in this country in terms of actual support on the ground for families with autism, particularly for families with young children, as they seek to get support particularly with new forms of therapy. We know that therapy for autistic children is particularly critical in the first five years of the child's life.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129977">Would the government be prepared to put some money toward assisting families in obtaining the therapeutic support that they need to help children with autism?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

There are a variety of programs across the spectrum among various provincial governments.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129980">We would urge the provincial governments to continue to do what they can to have the kind of support on the ground that these families will need.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Ms. Ratansi" id="3441235"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128259" Type="2">Ms. Yasmin Ratansi (Don Valley East, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="2129981">Madam Speaker, I am honoured to rise in the House to speak in support of Bill <Document DbId="4653461" Type="4">S-211, An Act respecting World Autism Awareness Day</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129982">There are many of us who have been affected by autism, either through families or friends. Many of my constituents in Don Valley East have approached me to help them with this problem.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129983">Autism can manifest itself in a variety of ways. Many times families of children of autism notice that their child's personality is different from other babies the same age. They hit milestones later and increasingly showed little awareness of the outside world. Their words became fewer, or they would bang or chew on their toes rather than playing with their toys.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129984">Families could not understand why their child had so many tantrums and why tantrums were so common, or when a child flapped his or her arms wildly or shoved a nearby adult who ventured too near. Birthday parties or grocery shopping could be distorted by outbursts of anger and frustration and they were compounded when other people did not understand or judged the parenting of these families.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129985">Eventually parents received the crushing diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. This diagnostic was made worse because there was a lack of understanding by the people around them.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2129986">Most parents are concerned whether their child will be an engineer, or lawyer, or teacher, or doctor or whether their child will marry and go forward in life. Parents with autistic children face the very real question of whether their children would lead independent lives or not and who would look after them when they were no longer around.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129987">Autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, is a neurological condition that causes a range of development disability. Some people can function well, while others are locked in a world of their own.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129988">Today ASD occurs in one in 165 children. This represents a 150% increase in the last six years, with no explanation for the dramatic increase. Worldwide, more children are affected by autism than AIDS, diabetes, pediatric cancer. In Canada a total of 48,000 children and 144,000 adults have some form of ASD.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129989">Someone who shows a number of the following characteristics and behaviours would likely be diagnosed with ASD: first, shows no interest in other people; second, does not know how to play with or talk to people; and third, develops language and speech skills slowly or not at all, or initiates and maintains conversations with difficulties, repeats ritualistic actions such as rocking, spinning, or staring. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2129990">Someone with a mild case could go undiagnosed for years and might only be detected when the person goes through a crisis. This would then bring them in contact with professionals, who may or may not be able to recognize this disorder.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129991">There is no known cause for autism, but research is focused on differences in brain function, environmental factors, genetics, immune responses and viral infection.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129992">There are those who believe that autism is caused by vaccination and this has led them to endanger the lives of their children and countless others by refusing to allow proven vaccines to be given to their children. This unproven theory of a cause and effect of vaccination and ASD has no basis in science. Parents should not be scared into making irrational choices, but should weigh all the options in regard to the treatment necessary for their child.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="15">(1315)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2129993">No single test will confirm that someone has ASD. Some people with mild forms of autism may never need treatment as they may function well and even excel. However, those with severe forms of disorder cannot function and may benefit from active therapy.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129994">There are several ways people with autism are treated. There is the applied behavioural analysis and intense behavioural intervention. These are both designed to actively engage children with behavioural communication, learning and socialization problems. However, therapy can be extremely expensive, as it may involved a one-on-one teaching for up to 40 hours per week, with a cost ranging from $30,000 to $80,000 a year.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129995">When I heard my hon. colleague say that the government was committed, I hope it will do the right thing and instead of wasting money on corporate tax cuts or jets, it will focus on what is necessary for kids. These kids and their parents need the money. It is very important that we have our priorities right.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129996">Other therapy may include counselling, development of motor and language skills, diet and medication and physiotherapy. It takes hard work, patience and sheer determination to help navigate the system and allow a child to emerge from the bonds of autism. The physical and psychological strain on a family can be overwhelming and the isolation profound.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2129997">I would like to first thank the sponsor of the bill, Senator Munson, as well as many colleagues who have been supportive in advancing this cause, MPs from <Affiliation DbId="128309" Type="2">Etobicoke North</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="128569" Type="2">Sackville—Eastern Shore</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="128626" Type="2">Sudbury</Affiliation>, <Affiliation DbId="128241" Type="2">Edmonton—Mill Woods—Beaumont</Affiliation> and <Affiliation DbId="128654" Type="2">Verchères—Les Patriotes</Affiliation> for their important work.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129998">I also want to thank Senators Eggleton and Keon who were the chair and deputy chair of the standing senate committee, which provided an extensive report on funding for autism entitled “Pay Now or Pay Later”.</ParaText><ParaText id="2129999">Bill <Document DbId="4653461" Type="4">S-211</Document> calls for Canada to join with member states of the United Nations to focus the world's attention on autism each April 2. World Autism Awareness Day shines a bright light on autism as a growing global health crisis and is one of only three disease-specific United Nations' days, reflecting the deep concern that the UN has.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130000">Bill <Document DbId="4653461" Type="4">S-211</Document> will not change the reality for families affected by autism. They struggle to make a future for their autistic child who is stuck, who needs better care and who needs better one-on-one intervention. These parents have to fight a battle every day to get treatments and make sacrifices to pay for those treatments.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2130001">I hope the government will put its money where its mouth is. Let us ensure that the government puts money for families, for care, because that is a very important aspect. As we can see, autism has increased 150% and there is no known reason. It is important that we, collectively, ensure that this problem is curtailed and that the parents whose child is autistic have the necessary resources.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130002">The bill would increase the opportunities of Canadians to learn about autism and recognize that in their communities there are families living with ASD. Last year the United Nations hosted a rock concert by Rudely Interrupted, whose members have various disabilities, including ASD.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130003">It is important that we fund research into the causes, prevention, treatments and cure of autism and raise public awareness about families. In 2006, the American combating autism act authorized nearly $1 billion in expenditure over five years to help families. One in three, or approximately ten million, Canadians will be affected by a neurological or psychiatric disease disorder. </ParaText><ParaText id="2130004">This past year Yoko Ono unveiled <I>Promise</I>.

In fact, this is a carbon copy of the same bill. Today, I will be reminding the House of our party's position.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130006">First of all, the Bloc Québécois supports the principle of the bill. However, we believe that some elements of the preamble contravene the constitutional rights of Quebec and the provinces. Although health care is an important issue for all Canadians, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is an area of jurisdiction belonging to Quebec and the provinces, as established by the Constitution. I would also like to reiterate that the federal government entered into an agreement with Quebec in 2004 which recognized Quebec's responsibility for this sector.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130007">The special agreement with Quebec, which the federal government pompously referred to as an asymmetric agreement, recognized that health care is within the jurisdiction of the Quebec government and that Quebec is not accountable to Ottawa but to Quebeckers. Consequently, it is natural for Quebec to make decisions about its priorities, which may differ from those of Canada, in order to meet the needs of our nation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2130008">The bill being debated today would designate April 2 as World Autism Awareness Day. This initiative follows the decision by the UN which, in 2008, proclaimed April 2 to be World Autism Day in order to encourage families affected by this illness to seek the services to which they are entitled. Quebec has an autism day in April and Canada has one in October.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130009">We are not concerned today with whether or not Bill <Document DbId="4653461" Type="4">S-211</Document> is a good measure or not, because we must do all that is required to support those suffering from autism and their families. My reservations concern some of the elements that indicate the legislator's intent to subtly insinuate itself into a jurisdiction belonging to Quebec and the provinces. </ParaText><ParaText id="2130010">First, we propose to delete lines 13 to 16 of the preamble, which state, “Whereas Canadian families affected by autism spectrum disorders have unequal access to services across the country”. That would respect Quebec's and the provinces' jurisdiction over health care.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2130011">That is also why I think it is inappropriate to read, “Whereas Canada has no national strategy to address autism spectrum disorders”.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130012">Since we consider national health strategies, or Canada-wide strategies, to be encroachments on an area of jurisdiction belonging to Quebec and the provinces, we want this paragraph to be withdrawn.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130013">As we have seen in other areas, a Canada-wide strategy could thwart the efforts made by Quebec in this regard by trying to standardize the practices involved. If the government decides to go ahead and impose a plan from coast to coast to coast, Quebec and the provinces will have to have the right to opt out with full compensation and no strings attached.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130014">Except for these reservations, the Bloc Québécois is in favour of Bill <Document DbId="4653461" Type="4">S-211</Document>. Since autism spectrum disorders affect more and more children around the world, it is important for families to have access to a growing number of services. The origin of and treatments for this disease are still not fully understood, making research into improving life for those with autism spectrum disorders even more necessary.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2130015">A World Autism Awareness Day is needed, not only to raise awareness about this complex syndrome, but also to encourage the public to contribute to improving the quality of life of thousands of families. It should be noted that Quebec has had an action plan for people with autism since 2003.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="25">(1325)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2130016">Around that time, the Government of Quebec published a report entitled “Un geste porteur d'avenir--Des services aux personnes présentant un trouble envahissant du développement, à leurs familles et à leurs proches” about services for people with pervasive developmental disorders, or PDDs, and their families.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130017">Quebec decided to focus on the importance of offering more quality services and facilitating access to those services by creating organizations to provide services to people with pervasive developmental disorders in each region of Quebec. There are now 16 regional associations working to help these people and their families.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130018">I would like to list these organizations, which are committed to helping people who really need help: Autisme Québec, Autisme Mauricie, Autisme et TED Centre-du-Québec, Société de l'autisme et des TED de l'Estrie, Action autisme et TED Haute-Côte-Nord Manicouagan, Association Nord-côtière de l'autisme et des troubles envahissants du développement, Société de l'Autisme--Région Lanaudière, Trait d'Union Outaouais, Société de l'autisme des Laurentides, Société de l'autisme et des autres troubles envahissants du développement de l'Abitibi-Témiscamingue, Association régionale Autisme et TED Montérégie, Nouvel Essor--Volet autisme-TED pour la région de Chaudière-Appalaches, Association de l'autisme et des autres TED de l'Est-du-Québec, Société de l'autisme--Région Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Société de l'autisme et des TED de Laval, and Autisme et troubles envahissants du développement de Montréal.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2130019">At this point, I would like to describe the condition in more technical detail. Autism spectrum disorders and pervasive developmental disorders affect about 60 children in 10,000. In 1980, that figure was 10 in 10,000. The incidence among boys is four times higher than that among girls. According to the international community, the rapid increase in pervasive developmental disorders is now considered a growing global crisis.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130020">Although the number of autism cases is skyrocketing around the world, there are still many questions about the extent to which higher rates of diagnosis are related to changes in the way people with the condition are identified and categorized.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130021">According to the Fédération québécoise de l'autisme et des autres troubles envahissants du développement, PDD comprises five disorders: autism, childhood disintegrative disorder, Asperger syndrome, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, which includes atypical autism, and Rett syndrome. PDDs usually manifest in early childhood as communication, socialization and learning disorders and dysfunction involving the five senses due to neurological and chemical problems. Each case must be treated individually on the basis of personalized clinical assessments. There is no miracle cure, although some have experienced significant improvement using a variety of educational and psychological methods.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2130022">It appears that research on this subject must continue before we can fully understand the causes of autism, which is known for its complex nature. We must give researchers in this area an environment conducive to its study.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130023">The Bloc Québécois is calling on the federal government to substantially increase research budgets and to transfer this money to Quebec and the provinces so they can better support university research chairs, for example. Whether it is basic or clinical health research, it falls under Quebec and provincial jurisdiction.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2130024">In closing, I would like to come back to a point I raised earlier, namely that in Quebec, April is Autism Month. With a theme such as “The many faces of autism”, it is an ideal time to raise awareness and inform the public. It is also an opportunity to break the taboos that continue to prevent those who are affected from integrating into society. Quebec singer Nicola Ciccone is a spokesperson. Many awareness activities are organized throughout Quebec for the occasion, from art exhibits to speeches by adults with autism.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130025">On April 24, 2010, in a party-like atmosphere, the march for autism was held in 11 regions and drew 3,000 people, which is twice as many as the previous year. The sixth annual march will be held next April 30 and marches will be organized throughout Quebec. I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to all the staff and volunteers who work to make this event a success, who are raising funds to help young people with autism attend a special day camp in summer 2011.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I also would like to congratulate my hon. colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128450" Type="2">Kitchener—Conestoga</Affiliation> for bringing this bill forward from the Senate. </ParaText><ParaText id="2130027">It is also a pleasure to speak to a bill that has the uniform support of all members of the House and, I dare say, of all parties of the House as we all join together in trying to shed some light and increase support for Canadian citizens and in fact anyone in the world who is touched by autism spectrum disorder.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130028">I am particularly pleased about this because one of the first bills I introduced in the House when I was elected in 2008 was Bill <Document DbId="4327792" Type="4">C-327, An Act respecting a Canadian Autism Day</Document>. At that time I said I was proud to introduce legislation that would recognize the work of those involved in every aspect of this subject and as well to recognize those who are affected by autism in any manner, whether as a person who has the disorder or as a family member or friend of someone who does.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2130029">My bill would recognize, as this one does, the challenges faced by friends and families of people with this condition and in particular parents who raise an autistic child and all the special people who work with and advocate for them. It is only right and long overdue to mark and appreciate these challenges. At that time my bill sought to make April 23 world autism day and to make that a Canadian autism day. I am pleased to say this concept is being pushed forward as well and I join with all the members of the House who have done so much work on this.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130030">The creation of a national or international autism day brings light and attention to those who fall on the autism spectrum and to those who tirelessly support a family member or friend. It reminds us that we require so much more in terms of funding for research, support and coverage under the Canada Health Act, which is long overdue.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2130031">We have heard a lot of very excellent descriptions of the technicalities of this disorder, so I will be brief on this, but of course autism spectrum disorder refers to the vast continuum of severity and developmental impairment of unknown origin. It is estimated that one in every 165 children is born with a type of ASD. There are approximately 200,000 Canadians estimated to be living with an ASD. I say ASD because, as my colleague from the Bloc just pointed out, there are different types of autism spectrum disorder ranging from autism to Asperger syndrome to pervasive developmental disorder of unknown origin.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130032">The most common autism spectrum disorder is found in young boys. In fact it is four times more common in boys than in girls, and autism is not related to race, ethnicity, family income, lifestyle or parenting. There is no standard type or “typical” person with an autism spectrum disorder.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2130033">This disorder is marked by some very specific signs and, of course, people fall within a wide spectrum with this disorder, from people who are profoundly affected all the way to extremely high functioning individuals. ASD is marked by difficulty with social skills. Some people with ASD show no interest in other people whatsoever. Others might be interested but not know how to talk to, play with, or relate to others. Initiating and maintaining a conversation is usually difficult for people with ASDs. It is marked by problems with communication. Speech and language skills may begin to develop, may begin late and then be lost, may develop more slowly or in fact may never develop.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130034">Without appropriate intensive early intervention, about 40% of children with ASDs do not talk at all. People with ASDs are often unable to interpret nonverbal communication such as social distance cues or the use of gestures and facial cues that most of us take for granted. There can be repeated behaviours and restricted interests. People with ASDs may have repeated ritualistic actions such as spinning, repeated rocking, staring, finger flapping and sometimes hitting themselves.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130035">They may also have very restricted interests, talking about or focusing obsessively on only one thing, idea or activity. Their habits may seem odd to others. Small changes in the environment or in a daily routine that most people can manage might trigger acute distress.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="35">(1335)</Timestamp><ParaText id="2130036">There is an unusual response to sensations in many cases. People with ASD may have both auditory and visual processing problems. Although sensory problems vary in autism, this can occur from mild to severe levels with over and under sensitivities of all types.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130037">Last, it is important to note that people with ASD often have very unique abilities. Some have an accurate and detailed memory for information and facts, high visual recall and a superb ability to manipulate data for useful purposes. They may be able to concentrate for long periods of time on particular tasks and be far more attentive to details than most of us.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130038"> We have heard a lot about the scientific and technical aspect, but I want to talk about the human aspect.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2130039">Outside my door in Vancouver Kingsway, I have noticed over the past several months a grandfather who walks by every day, pulling a wagon with a young girl in it. The young girl appears to be about five or six years old. I went out the other day and I brought a little Canadian flag to give to her. When I approached her, she turned away and was absolutely unable to interact with me at all. It quickly became apparent to me that this young girl obviously had ASD. I was so touched by the fact that her grandfather, every day without fail, would take her out into the community. It made me realize how much ASD is in our communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130040">My youngest daughter, Cerys Davies, suffers from a global developmental delay. It is not autism. She has many friends because we have had to become part of a community of parents who have children with differences of all types, ranging from Down's Syndrome to autism to physical and mental challenges of all types.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2130041">We must remember that we cannot just focus on autism. We have to focus on all developmental disorders that affect children, including those that are of unknown origin and even those that defy diagnosis. Hundreds of thousands of children in Canada are going to school every day without support, whether from a health care point of view or an educational point of view or social support point of view. We have to broaden this to include all of those children.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130042">I want to also point out that world-class research is being done in my riding on autism. Dr. Anthony Bailey had the very first endowed chair in the world researching autism. He is based out of Children's Hospital, where he does world-class research, particularly genetics in the autism field. There is absolute excitement and endless possibilities for what we could do for people with autism because of this kind of research. I commend Dr. Bailey for that.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130043">I want to quote from an email I received this morning from Lenore Clemens, who lives in my riding. She said:</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2130044"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Thank you, we need so many more resources, especially for those who have not received a definitive diagnosis BUT still all have the same general problem. No definitive diagnosis that fits a funding box, no supports for families or those with disabilities even with the same need for resources &amp; therapeutic interventions. Doctors often admit even when they, themselves, can't make a definite diagnosis therapies &amp; supports are needed but not available. Another huge issue is government, like the BC Liberals, is removing eligibility for supports from legislation...This is especially parents and schools. And a reminder to the House: tax credits don't work for the poor.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="2130045">Another person wrote and said:</ParaText><ParaText id="2130046"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">—what's happening in the Community Living sector in BC.

CLBC has to cut $22 million this fiscal year.</QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText><ParaText id="2130047">The bottom line is we need to have therapy and support for everybody with autism and all development disorders from childhood right through to adulthood.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2130048">This shows that it is not enough to declare a world autism day, as laudable and important as that is. We need to vastly increase the funding for not only research, which I give credit to the government for doing, but also to ensure we have supports for families and children at an early age. It is well known that early intervention for children with autism, as with every developmental disorder, is key to helping those children obtain the best possible results. We need to ensure there is support in schools, support from doctors and social supports in our communities to get these people the help they deserve.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Autism is an issue that impacts so many families and individuals from all walks of life, both in Canada and around the world. </ParaText><ParaText id="2130051">As we know, Bill <Document DbId="4653461" Type="4">S-211</Document> was recently amended to improve the accuracy of the bill while preserving its intent to promote autism awareness. The government is pleased to support Bill S-211, particularly as it serves to underscore our commitment to promoting autism knowledge and awareness. </ParaText><ParaText id="2130052">In practice, activities to promote autism awareness can take many forms and the ultimate outcome of these activities may vary as well. There is much that we do not know about autism, and to this end it is important to raise awareness of this condition so that it can be further understood and studied. </ParaText><ParaText id="2130053">Autism can be difficult to diagnose. Early interventions are considered key. In this context, by educating Canadians about autism we can contribute to earlier detection and, ideally, to better outcomes. </ParaText><ParaText id="2130054">Canadians impacted by autism are important members of our society with their own unique strengths. By promoting awareness of autism we can foster greater acceptance and understanding of these special individuals and provide them with the support they need to flourish.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2130055">These are, of course, only a few of the many reasons why it is important to foster awareness of autism. Actions to support autism awareness are continuous and take place each and every day through the efforts of governments, parliamentarians, stakeholder organizations, health care providers, researchers and Canadian citizens. </ParaText><ParaText id="2130056">In supporting autism awareness it is important that we have some knowledge of the condition. </ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="2130057">Autism is a spectrum disorder with symptoms ranging from mild to severe. Autism symptoms may include impaired communication, difficulty getting involved in interactive games and low levels of interest in socializing.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130058">That is not a complete list, but it does provide some good examples. Signs of autism can now be detected at 12 to 18 months of age, with most children being diagnosed before the age of 3. Autism is an extremely complex disorder that affects people for their whole lives.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130059">Autism affects Canadians from all walks of life, as well as their families, friends and caregivers. There is no such thing as a typical person with autism. Each individual has very different needs, attitudes and abilities. </ParaText><ParaText id="2130060">With respect to possible causes, genetic factors are emerging as the likeliest cause of autism, and researchers have shown how changes in certain genes contribute to the development of autism.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130061">Results suggest that autism genes may behave differently depending on the child's sex and that autism is four times more common among men.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130062">Researchers are also spending more time investigating whether environmental factors can trigger autism.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="45">(1345)</Timestamp><FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="2130063">In terms of prevalence, Canadian and international studies do show that autism spectrum disorders are more prevalent than previously believed. However, this should be considered in the context of improved diagnostic techniques, better reporting and a broader definition of autism.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130064">With respect to adults with autism, it is recognized that there is a need to offer supports across a lifespan. Moreover, adults with autism can suffer from co-morbid conditions, which furthers the need for support.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130065">What is clear is that there are many issues surrounding autism and that more information is needed to better understand these issues. It is this government's perspective that knowledge and awareness truly go hand in hand. I am sure that many members would agree that having easy access to information and knowing we can trust that information can make a huge difference in the lives of those affected by autism. This is why the federal government has been working with its partners and stakeholders to enhance the autism evidence base. I would like to take a few moments to touch upon some of this important work.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2130066">One important aspect of autism knowledge is surveillance. It is widely recognized that there is a shortage of evidence about the prevalence, causes and best treatments for autism. This is why it is important that we keep watch over this condition. </ParaText><ParaText id="2130067">Health surveillance is an ongoing process of data collection, expert analysis and interpretation, and furthermore, communicating the results or the resulting information that is gathered. Surveillance findings play an important role in supporting research, evidence-based health policies, programs and practices. This is why the Public Health Agency of Canada is starting a surveillance program that will help us to better understand the prevalence of autism in Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130068">In addition to surveillance, this government has placed an emphasis on the need for high-quality and rigorous research to find answers to many questions surrounding autism. This is why, through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, or CIHR, the Government of Canada has spent or committed approximately $39.5 million for autism-related research.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130069">In addition to health portfolio investments in research and surveillance, Health Canada has placed emphasis on the dissemination of autism knowledge. For example, Health Canada has invested in the Canadian Autism Intervention Research Network, which translates new research findings into terminology that is helpful for those who need it most, the individuals and the families who are affected by autism.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2130070">In conclusion, it is clear that the efforts to enhance autism knowledge and awareness can, will, and have touched the lives of many Canadians. This government is confident that its investments, in tandem with activity at the community, provincial and territorial levels, are culminating in tangible results by those affected by autism.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130071">By supporting Bill <Document DbId="4653461" Type="4">S-211</Document>, this government is pleased to continue to have the chance to reinforce its commitment to improving autism knowledge and awareness.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Can one imagine the problems if one lived in a rural area where the programs are not available at all?</ParaText><ParaText id="2130076">We have to look at this and take a national approach. I guess that is one of the downsides of health care being a provincial responsibility. What we have is a patchwork quilt of programs across the country. </ParaText><ParaText id="2130077">It is widely known that Alberta has a very good series of programs, but that should be available right across the country.

Also, early intervention in the treatment of autism spectrum disorders can have promising results in helping people engage with and contribute to society. A number of years ago I think people were simply not aware of the problem and tended to ignore it. The recognition that we have to be proactive is coming to the forefront in this country.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130089">It has been pointed out that there is no known cause or cure for autism spectrum disorders and 192 United Nations representatives agree that the World Autism Awareness Day could draw the attention of people across the globe to this neurological disorder that is affecting an increasing number of families. In 2007, the United Nations General Assembly designated April 2, from 2008 on, as Autism Awareness Day. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="2130090">Canada is a signatory, as members know, to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the United Nations Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which maintains that children with disabilities should enjoy a full and decent life in conditions that ensure dignity, promote self-reliance and facilitate their active participation in the community, while also enjoying all active human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis with other children. That is contributing to the demand by parents in society in general that these children need to be helped now and not somehow put off for future attention. Canada is a member of the United Nations and supports the vital work of that organization. </ParaText><ParaText id="2130091"> April 2 will be known as World Autism Awareness Day. I believe the federal minister announced last year that April 2 would be World Autism Awareness Day.</ParaText><ParaText id="2130092">In terms of autism itself, ASD is a neurological disorder that causes developmental disability. The term “spectrum” refers to a continuum of severity or development impairment. People with ASD develop differently from others in the areas of motor , language, cognitive and social skills. Autism causes difficulties with verbal and non-verbal communication, difficulties with social interaction and understanding and unusual patterns of behaviour, activities and interests. </ParaText>
