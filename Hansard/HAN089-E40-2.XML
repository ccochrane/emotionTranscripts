				<CatchLine>Privilege</CatchLine><SubjectOfBusinessContent><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Szabo" id="2876024"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128094" Type="2">Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1607174">Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 48(1) and (2), I am rising on a question of privilege for which I have given written notice to the Speaker at <?bk?>8 a.m.<?ek?> this morning. It is relating, as I indicated in my letter, to a matter which disturbs me very personally and significantly because it is a matter which I believe is an attempt to intimidate me from discharging my duties as a member of Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607175">Yesterday, during question period, I raised a question which had to do with the <Affiliation DbId="128634" Type="2">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation>. It was a question which brought into question her actions and decisions to deliberately or knowingly put herself in a conflict of interest with regard to using a registered lobbyist to do political fundraising for her and, as well, to procure the resources and private information of the Toronto Port Authority for purposes of political fundraising.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607176">In raising those points, which the <Affiliation DbId="128634" Type="2">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> acknowledged were correct and that they were totally unacceptable, the <Affiliation DbId="128634" Type="2">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> made a rude finger gesture at me, in the middle of the question. It was distracting.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607177"> I raise this because this is not just a question; for instance, there was the issue where the member for <Affiliation DbId="128224" Type="2">Nepean—Carleton</Affiliation> and a couple of other members were shown on film making certain gestures which were unparliamentary and it was dealt with as a privilege issue. However, because it was in the context of many members, et cetera, nothing between two members or whatever, the matter resulted in just an instruction to members that these kinds of things are inappropriate.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607178">However,--</ParaText><ParaText Interjection="e1" id="1607179"><Affiliation DbId="128822" Type="2">Mr. David Anderson: </Affiliation>That's BS.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607180"><Affiliation DbId="128094">Mr. Paul Szabo: </Affiliation> Well, no. Mr. Speaker, the member just said this is BS, and this is a Conservative member for whom I have a great deal of respect, but this is the kind of intimidation of which I speak.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607181">It is not just that someone, some person, did what some would refer to as flip the bird or give a middle finger gesture to someone in a random occurrence. </ParaText><ParaText id="1607182">Mr. Speaker, you must consider the point of time at which it was done and the context in which it was done. That gesture says much more than simply, “I don't respect you”. It says much more.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607183">In fact, the issue here it this, and I could go through a number of the processes, but I do not want to take up time. I want to be direct on this matter with the House because what happened has concerned me and disturbed me very much.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607184">I happen to be the chair of the standing committee on ethics. I have had some activity, in terms of ethical activity, which I know is not a good experience for the government. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1607185">However, I was also in receipt of the direct evidence showing that the <Affiliation DbId="128708" Type="4">natural resources minister</Affiliation> was in a conflict of interest and had breached the code of conduct for public office holders for ministers, parliamentary secretaries and other order in council appointees.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607186">The minister also noted that I have called for investigations to be conducted by the Ethics Commissioner, the Commissioner of Lobbying and the Chief Electoral Officer. </ParaText><ParaText id="1607187">In the context of the things that I have to do, my duties and responsibilities as a member of Parliament, that gesture to me, at the time it was being raised and after it had been in the media, was a direct statement to me that the minister was contemptuous of my right to freedom of speech, which is constitutionally protected, to raise those matters in the House, to protect the interest of the House, and to raise these issues on behalf of all Canadians. </ParaText><ParaText id="1607188">It is a constitutionally protected right. My freedom of speech is a constitutionally protected right.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607189">I am afraid that this is an indication that any attempt that I make in my responsibilities, whether it be as chair of the ethics committee or as an ordinary member of Parliament, to seek to have investigations until the government takes action with regard to breach of conduct and failure to abide by the code of conduct for ministers, which has been put into law, will be challenged.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607190">Let me conclude. I see that you have heard enough, Mr. Speaker, and I accept that. I want you to know that I am very disturbed by what happened. I am very concerned. I feel intimidated, I feel that my rights are being challenged and I am anticipating that this is going to continue while I try to discharge my duties.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607191">I wanted to bring it to the House's attention at the earliest opportunity, which I have done. I can also indicate that the member for <Affiliation DbId="128483" Type="2">Oak Ridges—Markham</Affiliation>, who is not in the House today, was a witness. I am sure there are others. He is not here today but will be prepared to rise in the House to confirm this.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607192">Mr. Speaker, should you find a prima facie case of breach of my personal privileges or simply a breach of privilege, I will be prepared to move the appropriate motion.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Lukiwski" id="2876027"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128856" Type="18">Mr. Tom Lukiwski (Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1607193">Mr. Speaker, I have a few points to make.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607194">First, as we well know, a question of privilege is only relevant and should only be considered if in fact it impugns or interferes with the MP's ability to do his job. What the member is alleging in no way, in my opinion at least, would have any effect whatsoever on his ability to do his job as a member of Parliament.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607195">Second, I would suggest that it is patently unfair to be raising this point now without the opportunity for the minister in question to respond. </ParaText><ParaText id="1607196">Third, and even more important, is the question that goes far beyond this. The member in question is the chair of the ethics committee. He has quite clearly stated his prejudice and bias in this matter that may come before his committee by his intervention today. There is absolutely no question that the member, as chair, will have no neutrality or impartiality if this issue ever comes before his committee.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607197">I think the correct procedure for the member as committee chair is to recuse himself. He should admit he has a bias in this matter and to step down as chair. How in the world can any committee operate with a chairperson who has a bias for an issue that comes before that committee? It is absolutely impossible for the democratic process to work and for committees to work and function in such a fashion in which we can respect the rights of all members.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607198">I would strongly suggest that the member give strong consideration, himself, to stepping down as committee chair if and when the issue of the Toronto Port Authority and the minister's fundraiser ever comes up. If he does not, he himself will be pointing out to all members in the House that the impartiality of committees and committee chairs is a joke. The member should take very close heed of my words.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mrs. Jennings" id="2876029"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128273" Type="2">Hon. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1607199">Mr. Speaker, I have two points. First, the question of privilege raised by my hon. colleague is in fact serious and merits a serious look and examination by the Speaker. That is the first thing.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607200">Second, the allegation or claim which has now been raised by the Conservative member that the Liberal chair of the ethics committee has demonstrated a bias is completely without foundation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607201"> The member has raised an issue that there are allegations of transgressions by a certain minister, the <Affiliation DbId="128708" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> with regard to the code of conduct for public office holders with regard to electoral financing legislation and with regard to the Lobbyists Registration Act.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607202">The government itself, through the <Affiliation DbId="128696" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> confirmed that in fact there were certain events that took place and that it was completely unacceptable.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607203">For this member to call on the chair of the ethics committee to recuse himself should the matter of the conduct of the <Affiliation DbId="128708" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> come before that committee is simply without foundation and without grounds.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607204">When one speaks to allegations, that it is not evidence of any prejudice. It is simply a statement of fact that there are allegations, that certain acts did take place which were confirmed by the government <Affiliation DbId="128696" Type="4">Minister of Transport</Affiliation> and that there are people who are concerned that these may be violations of certain legislation and certain codes, period.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="No" ToCText="The Deputy Speaker" id="2876030"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="129030" Type="22">The Deputy Speaker</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1607205">I think I have heard all I need to hear on the question of privilege raised by the member for <Affiliation DbId="128094" Type="2">Mississauga South</Affiliation>. I am not sure if there is a second point to be made here.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607206">I see the hon. parliamentary secretary is quite keen to make an intervention. I will hear him, but I think it would be wise to move on to the next item before the House.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Lukiwski" id="2876031"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128856" Type="18">Mr. Tom Lukiwski</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1607207">Mr. Speaker, I do want to respond to my hon. colleague who was basically challenging my interpretation of why the committee chair of the ethics committee should recuse itself.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607208">I would point out that the member for <Affiliation DbId="128094" Type="2">Mississauga South</Affiliation>, who is the chair of the ethics committee, is quoted in the <I>Toronto Star</I> as saying that the minister is clearly in a breach of ethics. In other words, he has made up his mind.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607209"> One cannot be neutral or impartial if one has already been quoted, stating a decision. He has stated that there is a clear breach of ethics in his opinion. How in fact is that impartial?</ParaText><ParaText id="1607210"> Quite frankly, the whole issue of a question of privilege is ludicrous. The freedom of speech of the member has not be curtailed, and that is the key element in determining whether there is a question of privilege. The reason his freedom of speech has not been curtailed is underscored by the fact that he has just made a demonstration that his speech has not been curtailed with his rant in this House.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607211">Beyond the fact that his question of privilege is irrelevant and should be dismissed, the fact is that as chair of the ethics committee he has already been predisposed to an opinion on the guilt or innocence of the member in question.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607212"> How in the world can he stay on as chair? I would suggest that he cannot. I would suspect that if he does not step down himself, committee members should deal with this expeditiously.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

I will certainly take it under advisement and examine what evidence there might be from the House, and maybe invite the <Affiliation DbId="128708" Type="4">Minister of Natural Resources</Affiliation> to make a comment on it. I think that is probably the best course of action.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607214">I will examine what was argued here today by the hon. parliamentary secretary, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128273" Type="2">Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine</Affiliation> and the member for <Affiliation DbId="128094" Type="2">Mississauga South</Affiliation>.

					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Saxton" id="2876037"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128872" Type="18">Mr. Andrew Saxton (Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Treasury Board, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1607216">Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak to the second reading of the economic recovery act. This important piece of legislation will implement key portions of budget 2009, Canada's economic action plan, along with other vital measures. There is no doubt that Canada's economy has been profoundly affected by the global economic slowdown, but Canada's economic action plan is getting results, stimulating the economy, protecting and creating new jobs. </ParaText><ParaText id="1607217">While we are still fighting the recession, one we must always remember was not of our making, we are beginning to see tentative signs of an economic recovery both here and abroad.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607218">As Warren Jestin, chief economist at Scotiabank noted:</ParaText><ParaText id="1607219"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Monthly job losses appear to have crested and confidence surveys suggest that consumers and businesses are becoming less negative about current conditions and cautiously more optimistic...</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1607220"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">[Canada] was dragged fully into the global recession only when faltering emerging economies triggered a collapse in resource prices and export earnings...[and] the erosion in employment, housing activity and car sales has been less severe than [it has been] south of the border.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1607221"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> The bottom line--we will soon begin moving away from one of the most difficult economic setbacks experienced in our lives, but patience will be required because the road to recovery will be a long and winding one.</QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607222">Clearly, we must remember there is still more to do. We must stay on course. Doing anything else would be reckless and irresponsible. Indeed the goals of the measures included in the economic recovery act are to stay the course, maintain our competitive economic position today and build on it by laying the groundwork for the necessary stability to grow Canada's economy tomorrow, stability to ensure that when the global recession eases, Canada will exit in a stronger position.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607223">My constituents in <Affiliation DbId="128513" Type="2">North Vancouver</Affiliation> are concerned about the global economic slowdown and expect us to act. And we have acted. I am proud of this government's record. </ParaText><ParaText id="1607224">Later today, my colleague and a new member of the finance committee, the member for <Affiliation DbId="128336" Type="2">Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar</Affiliation>, will outline a few of the highlights of this act, such as the home renovation tax credit, the first-time homebuyers' tax credit, and the enhancement to the working income tax benefit. These are benefits that I hear about as I speak with my constituents in North Vancouver. I hear how they are enjoying the benefits of the home renovation tax credit. Families as well as small businesses are benefiting.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607225">First-time homebuyers in my riding are excited about the first-time homebuyers' tax credit, and I am proud to be part of the government that is working on behalf of all Canadians. During my speech I will review some of the important initiatives included in this act. Among them is one that will significantly improve government transparency and accountability while also fulfilling a promise that our <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> made during the 2008 election campaign.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607226">Last fall the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> and the Conservative Party pledged to make government more accountable for the use of taxpayers' money. As laid out on page 25 of our campaign platform, we promised Canadians that a re-elected Conservative government would require all federal departments and agencies to produce detailed quarterly financial statements.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607227"> I am happy to report that through the economic recovery act, we are delivering on that campaign promise.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607228">The act will amend the Financial Administration Act to require federal departments and crown corporations to prepare public quarterly financial reports and more importantly, make them available to the public. Quarterly financial reporting will ensure parliamentarians and Canadians are provided with greatly enhanced information on government spending. This will also help to ensure more timely and better oversight of government expenditures by parliamentarians and taxpayers so that expenditures are subject to regular, ongoing and necessary scrutiny.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607229">Our Conservative government, the government that created the Parliamentary Budget Office and brought in the Accountability Act, believes that taxpayers' dollars are just that--taxpayers' dollars. We believe that respecting taxpayers' money and prudently managing it includes the provision of transparent and timely accounting of how taxpayers' money is spent. Currently, Parliament and Canadians are provided financial statements only several months after the end of each fiscal year.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607230">Unlike the previous Liberal government, we believe that this is just not good enough. That is why passage of this act would require federal departments and crown corporations to provide quarterly financial reports on their activities, ensuring parliamentarians and Canadians have useful, up-to-date financial information that allows them to more quickly and accurately track spending.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="25">(1025)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1607231">One wonders what politician could possibly oppose the kind of transparency and accountability which our economic recovery bill would bring into force. Shockingly, the <Affiliation DbId="129313" Type="9">Liberal leader</Affiliation> and his Liberal members, in an effort to force an unnecessary election, have pledged to vote against this bill and this landmark measure.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607232">However, that is not the only key measure the <Affiliation DbId="129313" Type="9">Liberal leader</Affiliation> and the Liberal members are voting against for no reason other than to force an election that no Canadian wants. The Liberals are also opposing key reforms to strengthen public pensions in Canada, reforms to the Canada pension plan, or CPP, that will allow increased flexibility in how Canadians live, work and retire, while ensuring CPP remains affordable and fair for future generations.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607233">The Canada pension plan remains one of the most successful pension plans in the world. As Susan Eng of Canada's Association for the Fifty-plus, better known as CARP, recently declared, the CPP was the pension plan that survived the recent global economic downturn almost unscathed.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607234">Through the CPP, Canadians are provided with a secure, indexed and lifelong benefit. The additional measures proposed in the economic recovery bill not only will help maintain the quality of the CPP but also will actually improve it for seniors during these difficult economic times.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607235">I note that these reforms were unanimously agreed to by each and every federal, provincial or territorial government, governments of all political stripes such as the New Democratic government in Manitoba, the Liberal governments of Ontario and New Brunswick, the Progressive Conservative government in Alberta, and the list goes on.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607236">As a point of clarification and for background, I note that the CPP is a jointly managed federal, provincial and territorial plan. Federal or provincial governments cannot unilaterally alter the CPP. Instead a joint review of the plan is required to be undertaken by federal, provincial and territorial governments every three years. The most recent review, concluded in May 2009, recommended the reforms that I will be outlining in my remarks today.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607237">Furthermore, let me note that the recommendations flowing from that review were publicly announced in May. As well, a detailed information paper that explains the proposed changes and their impacts upon workers and employers in Canada is available to Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607238">As previously mentioned, the reforms proposed in the economic recovery bill are intended to modernize the CPP to better reflect the many different paths people take to retirement today. These reforms will provide greater flexibility for older workers to combine pension and work income if they wish to do so, expand pension coverage and improve fairness in the plan's flexible retirement provisions.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607239"> The reforms specifically include removing the work cessation test in 2012 so that a person may take his or her retirement pension as early as age 60 without the requirement of a work interruption or earnings reduction; increasing the dropout from 15% to 16% in 2012, and to 17% in 2014, a change that would allow a maximum of almost seven and a half years of low or zero earnings to be dropped from the contributory period; and requiring a person under the age of 65 who receives a retirement pension and continues working to contribute to the CPP, thereby creating eligibility for a post-retirement benefit.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607240">As I mentioned earlier, the reforms I have outlined were publicly released in May and have already generated considerable positive feedback. </ParaText><ParaText id="1607241">An <I>Edmonton Journal</I> editorial from May welcomed the reforms, remarking that they will</ParaText><ParaText id="1607242"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">allow Canadians of a certain age to draw on their Canada Pension Plan benefits and still be allowed to work...the prospect that thousands will be able to discern a horizon when they can not only choose to be gainfully employed but also collect on a pension they paid into for years must come as some relief...</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1607243"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">In fact, upon even the briefest reflection it seems odd that this rather simple case of fair play wasn't in force years ago...After all, what would we think if our private pensions were withheld or clawed back because we decided to pick up a job or two following official retirement? </QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607244"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">As well, a nation rooted in liberty such as ours should never, ever build in disincentives for those who want to be engaged in productive work. That's simply antithetical to the story of Canadian enterprise. Another positive aspect of the proposed CPP amendments will allow those who are 65 or older and still employed to continue to contribute to the plan. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1607245"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">As well, citizens will be permitted to drop an additional low-earning year from the equation that calculates pension benefits. Those who decide to delay the start of their CPP income until age 70 will be further rewarded, with benefits pumped up to 42 per cent versus the current maximum of a 30-per cent increase for working longer.</QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="30">(1030)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1607246">The <I>Edmonton Journal</I> editorial concluded by cheering what it labelled an “overdue update”, as it:</ParaText><ParaText id="1607247"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...reflects contemporary realities. Older Canadians are healthier than ever and getting even fitter. If they want or need to continue to make a material contribution to the nation's productivity, they mustn't be discouraged.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1607248">However, that is not the only positive feedback we have heard. Jack Mintz, public policy professor at the University of Calgary, applauded them by saying, “the more flexibility you build into pension arrangements, the better”.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607249">Finn Poschmann from the C.D. Howe Institute declared that they were: </ParaText><ParaText id="1607250"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">...an important shift in public pension policy...[t]he proposed adjustments mark an important sea change in government pension policy's approach to dealing with population ageing and, in particular, making it easier for those people who want to work later in life to do so.</QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText><ParaText id="1607251">Clearly, the new measures will ensure that the CPP continues to address the needs of Canadians.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607252">I would also note that this is only one example of how our Conservative government has been engaged in the important issue of pensions. Indeed, our Conservative government has been and is working hard on this issue, work that would be derailed should the Liberal scheme to force yet another unnecessary election on Canadians succeed.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607253">Our Conservative government has already been engaged in a discussion with Canadians on pensions. In January we released a major research paper on federally regulated pension plans for comment, after which we conducted cross-country and online public consultations open to all. Based on the feedback we received from Canadians coast to coast, comprehensive regulatory changes to improve the federal pension framework are being drafted and will be released shortly. </ParaText><ParaText id="1607254">Also, we have long recognized the need to work with our provincial partners to examine the larger pension concerns facing Canadians. That is why we raised this issue at the annual meeting of finance ministers in late 2008, and earlier this year set up a joint federal-provincial research working group, with respected academic Jack Mintz as director of research to conduct an in-depth examination of retirement income adequacy. The <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4"> finance minister </Affiliation>has already convened a meeting of his provincial and territorial counterparts for this coming December to discuss the findings of this important group.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607255"> If members truly believe the future of Canadian pensions deserves attention, they will recognize our efforts and work with our Conservative government, support the economic recovery bill and not jeopardize it and plunge Canada into yet another election. While I doubt that the Liberal opposition will reconsider their obsession with forcing an election, Canadians should rest assured that our Conservative government stands with hard-working Canadians who want to be able to count on their pension plan for a stable retirement. We will take the steps required to make sure Canada's pension framework is strong.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607256">The economic recovery act, with these important reforms to CPP, is a tangible demonstration of that. There is much more to the economic recovery act such as supporting farmers affected by severe weather as we extend important tax deferrals; ensuring dependability for public broadcasting by increasing the borrowing limit for the CBC, as requested by the CBC board of directors; promoting global growth and cooperation by giving small and low-income countries a bigger voice at the IMF, while strengthening Canada's commitment to debt relief; and resolving the Crown share saga, as our Conservative government, after decades of neglect by previous Liberal governments, is ensuring that Nova Scotia finally benefits from its resources through Crown share adjustment payments in accordance with the landmark agreement between Canada and Nova Scotia.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607257">Yet the Liberal leader would vote a against these measures, not out of principle, not out of some disagreement over the contents of the act, for he has likely never even read it, but for narrow, partisan self-interest. He wants an election, regardless of the consequences, not because he has an economic agenda, but because he wants power.

John McCallum (Markham—Unionville, Lib.)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1607299">Mr. Speaker, the Liberal Party will vote against this bill for one very simple reason: we have lost all confidence in this government not only for economic reasons, but also because of its budget and other budget statements. </ParaText>
							<FloorLanguage language="EN">[<I>English</I>]</FloorLanguage><ParaText id="1607300">I would like to take my time to go through the history of the budgetary actions of the government over the last year, which have led, in large measure, the Liberal Party to lose confidence in the government. The reason for this loss of confidence involves three aspects of the budgetary performance of the government: first, incompetence; second, dishonesty; and third, a distinct lack of concern for the most vulnerable in Canadian society.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607301">Let us go back to last November. Do members remember when the Conservatives were still telling everybody that things were just fine, that perhaps we would have a technical recession. They tabled an economic update that contained no help for Canadians and it attacked pay equity for women, rather than providing any stimulative measures for the economy. It was an update the ripped back pay increases for the RCMP, which the government had given it just before the election.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607302">The <Affiliation DbId="128696" Type="4">transport minister</Affiliation> reminded us in the House yesterday when he stated, “we were the last ones to deal with this global economic downturn”. He is absolutely right. Last November, most other countries had already passed budgets to give fiscal stimulus to their economies. At that very moment, the government was doing the opposite. It was offering cutbacks in that November economic statement, probably at the moment when the recession was at its most severe. That is grossly incompetent.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607303"> The statement is also dishonest. We will recall that the government, at that time, said that we had nothing but surpluses. Not an economist in the land believed that statement, with the possible exception of the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. These fictitious surpluses were created partly by cutting government spending at the height of the recession, partly by fictitious non-existent asset sales, which padded the revenue of the government in a manner that was totally against accounting rules. The proof that those asset sales were fraudulent is the fact that in the last budget the government removed them. The government admitted that they should not have been there in the first place.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607304">The November economic statement containing fraudulent surpluses, cuts to government spending at the most inappropriate time, at the depth of a recession, was so bad that it caused three formerly warring parties, the Bloc, the NDP and the Liberal Party, to unite as one and to threaten to topple the government. It was only for that reason that two months later, in January, the government, under threat of death, was forced to bring in a relatively decent budget.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607305">Had the Conservatives been a majority government, had they not been forced under threat of execution to do this, we would have been left with that November economic statement, with its cuts to government spending at a time of recession. They had no choice. They brought in a budget that was semi-decent, in our opinion. It provided a certain amount of fiscal stimulus through infrastructure and other measures and the Liberal Party supported it. We felt it was in the national interest to get that money out the door as quickly as possible to save or create as many jobs as possible. </ParaText><ParaText id="1607306">However, that budget failed in the execution. We supported it because we wanted to get the money out the door, to save and create jobs. We now know that the money failed to get out the door.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607307">The government uses weasel words like “commitments” or “announcements”, but what really matters is money out the door, people employed, shovels in the ground, construction workers on sites. This is where the government has utterly failed to execute its budget.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="50">(1050)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1607308">Our information from surveys from many mayors across the country is that only 12% of those funds have actually resulted in jobs being saved or created. If only for that reason, we cannot support the government and its budget anymore. We supported it on the condition that it execute it but it failed to execute it and, therefore, has rightly lost the confidence of the official opposition.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607309">Now we come to the third report card, the one the <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> unveiled this past Monday. We were hoping the government would at least provide Canadians with a glimpse of how much of the stimulus money had been spent and how far along infrastructure projects were. Instead, we got nothing. It is not as though the government does not have this information. </ParaText><ParaText id="1607310">This is where I come to the dishonesty and lack of transparency. The infrastructure stimulus fund requires all organizations that receive funding to provide the Conservatives with quarterly reports that outline just how far along their projects are and just how much money they have spent. It is item number 10 in the program's guideline.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607311">The government has all this information at its fingertips and could easily make this information public. However, it is deliberately choosing to hide it. Why would that be? The only plausible conclusion that can be drawn is that it is ashamed of the results. Why else would it have those results in its possession and refuse to give them to Canadians? It must be that it is ashamed of the results. It does not want Canadians to see that after talking about all these billions of dollars in projects, the Government of Canada has barely sent out any actual money.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607312">Even the Parliamentary Budget Officer, an officer the government is doing its best to destroy, has been told that this information is for Conservative eyes only and that he will not be allowed to have a peek. The saddest part is that this information would not be hard to provide. </ParaText><ParaText id="1607313">Let us consider what is happening south of the border. President Obama also asked each funding recipient to provide similar quarterly reports about how projects are progressing and how much money has been received. The difference in the United States is that on October 15, President Obama will be posting all these reports on recovery.gov so that Americans can actually see how their stimulus plan is working. Canadians will not be so fortunate under their overcontrolling and anti-transparent <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation>. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607314">I cannot understand why Americans deserve to get the real facts from their government in terms of money out the door and jobs created and Canadians do not.

I do not understand why the government cannot at least provide the same information to Canadians that the U.S. government is providing to Americans.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607315">The message is clear. The Conservatives know full well that they have failed to get the job done and they are simply trying to hide that fact from the very Canadians that they have failed. </ParaText><ParaText id="1607316">The <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister</Affiliation> himself summed up that failure when he unveiled the third budget card last week. In his assessment of how well his stimulus package has worked, he said, “Far too many Canadians are still out of work.

His answer was no, because the Liberals have no confidence in the government. They do, however, intend to implement the measures contained in that bill once they are “in government”.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607660">We in the Bloc Québécois, who voted for the ways and means motion on the same matters, which no more than Bill <Document DbId="4109870" Type="3">C-51</Document> contained a poison pill, will be voting in favour of this bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607661">We maintain that the aspects affecting the people of Canada and Quebec are very important for our constituents, whose needs and aspirations we have been monitoring on an ongoing basis, but even more actively during the campaign before the election one year ago already, on October 14.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607662">We are capable of rising in support of things we had sought previously for the people of Quebec and which can certainly benefit the people of Canada as well.</ParaText>

I should point out that this measure was inspired by the proposals made in the Bloc's two recovery plans. The first plan was presented around November 24, 2008, and the second around April 30, 2009.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607664">I remember as though it were yesterday when the <Affiliation DbId="78777" Type="4">Minister of Finance</Affiliation> was very appreciative that the Bloc Québécois was the only party to make proposals for the budget the government was preparing. He said something very similar when the budget was introduced. In the same sentence, or at least very close, he said that the Bloc Québécois was the only responsible party. Those may not have been his exact words, but that is what he meant: a responsible party that had submitted budget proposals with some very important points.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607665">At the same time, he told us that he promised he would take them into account. The Bloc Québécois is a party that accepts its responsibility for the mandate it has been given by the people of Quebec. It is committed to the interests of Quebec, and submitted proposals that further the needs and aspirations of Quebec. If I may say candidly, he quite simply told us that they would take them into account, but the budget had already been tabled at that point.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607666">In Bill <Document DbId="4109870" Type="3">C-51</Document>, the second point introduces a first time homebuyers' tax credit, a measure inspired by the Bloc's last platform. This is yet more proof that the Bloc made good proposals, always based on the needs and aspirations of Quebec, which I will repeat over and over.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607667">It needs to be said, because Quebeckers want the Bloc Québécois to defend their interests and to promote Quebec sovereignty. We know that a lot of things can be accomplished through the sovereignty of Quebec, that is, the political freedom of Quebec.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="20">(1220)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1607668">Bill <Document DbId="4109870" Type="3">C-51</Document> will also implement Canada's international commitments to the IMF, which were signed in 2008. It will also amend the Canada Pension Plan, from which Quebec is excluded, based on consultations with the provinces involved. It will also act on the findings of a joint expert panel made up of representatives of Nova Scotia and the federal government to resolve litigation between the parties that has been outstanding since 1984. The first two of these provisions affect Quebeckers more directly. That is why the Bloc Québécois is in favour of this bill. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607669">We agree with these two provisions, but I must emphasize that our support for the measures in this bill does not mean that we have confidence in the government.

That is why we oppose it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607670">However, because Quebec does not object to the measures in Bill <Document DbId="4109870" Type="3">C-51</Document>, we, the Bloc Québécois, will remain true to our values and do the responsible thing and support this bill. We are always working to advance Quebec's interests. The measures in this bill may be a step forward, but the Conservative government still does not have an environmental plan with a 21st century vision, and its record on economic issues is terrible. <Sup></Sup></ParaText><ParaText id="1607671">Now that I have covered the two most important measures in this bill, I would like to talk about the government's disastrous record on economic issues and the Bloc Québécois' recommendations for dealing with the crisis. I would also like to discuss the Bloc Québécois' green strategy and the federal government's bad faith and deplorable attitude when it comes to this issue.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607672">Let us begin with the home renovation tax credit. In April 2008, during the presentation of the first phase of the stimulus package, the Bloc Québécois proposed implementing a home renovation tax credit for converting oil furnaces to energy efficient models. We felt that such a measure, in addition to reducing our dependence on oil, would help inject money into the economy quickly. </ParaText><ParaText id="1607673">Although the Conservatives' measure does not target energy retrofits, it is nonetheless an effective way to stimulate the economy quickly. That is why we support this measure. Nevertheless, we still feel that the government lacked vision in introducing this tax credit. It could have gone much further and presented a real environmental plan that would have stimulated the economy while reducing greenhouse gases and decreasing our dependence on oil.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607674">It is imperative. We know more and more—not only because we hear it so much, but also because we are experiencing it and seeing it every day—that the economy and the environment are inseparable and that we have to put as much energy into the one as the other.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="25">(1225)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1607675">In our 2008 election platform, we also proposed a tax credit for first time homebuyers. Although the measure introduced by the Conservatives is less generous than the one proposed by the Bloc Québécois, we feel it is a step in the right direction. That is another reason we are supporting this measure. </ParaText><ParaText id="1607676">Buying a home is big step for many families. It allows the homeowner to build equity and benefit from the appreciated value of their home. Quebec is significantly behind the rest of Canada in that area. I do not want to focus on strictly economic aspects, but in terms of family life, it is very important to own a home in order to have a life that is not necessarily more comfortable, but has all the elements to be more pleasant. There is nothing like being at home with your children for living life to the fullest. Owning a home is very important and many families, unfortunately, often have a hard time saving for a down payment to purchase their first home.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607677">In addition, since most people who are active in the workforce see their income increase over time, they often have to wait a while before they can purchase a property, so they end up in the rental market for many years. We in the Bloc Québécois are aware of this problem and planned—in fact, we still plan to—bring forward a program to make it easier for first time homebuyers. That is why we are proposing that the government give interest free loans for up to $10,000 for first time homebuyers. If this measure is introduced, it will complement the tax credit proposed by the Conservatives and will make it easier for people to buy their first home. However, the Bloc Québécois will continue to press the federal government to offer a comprehensive first time homebuyers' plan.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607678">In light of these two elements, we support the bill, but of course we still have some criticisms of it. A good, self-respecting Conservative government must always make a few missteps that arouse criticism, and people need to hear about them.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607679">While denying the economic crisis during the last election campaign, the Conservatives came in empty-handed at the time of the economic statement last November. When pressured to introduce a stimulus package, the Conservatives preferred instead to propose measures meant to reinforce an ideology rather than stimulate the economy. The Bloc Québécois, however, brought forward responsible proposals for economic recovery. Let me remind the House. The Bloc Québécois' recovery plan had four objectives: tighten the social safety net and restore confidence; stimulate employment and investment; support Quebec and the provinces; and stimulate strategic spending and reduce oil dependency.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607680">The OECD suggested that countries with the means to do so should provide income support for workers who lose their jobs, and the best way to do that is through the employment insurance system. We therefore proposed that the system be thoroughly improved in order to facilitate access for everyone who loses their jobs. We estimated that, with these changes, 148,000 more people would have access every year. Furthermore, with the elimination of the waiting period, cheques could have been sent in under 14 days.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="30">(1230)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1607681">I would like to elaborate on this point. Rather than abolishing the waiting period, the Conservative government added five weeks at the end. Five weeks at the end is not the same as two weeks at the beginning. According to the Conservatives, two weeks at the beginning could create huge problems. The approach that the Conservatives have always preferred and continue to embrace is to launch programs and what they call improvements knowing very well that they will probably not be used very much, if at all. Most people never get to those last five weeks. Once again, they have missed the mark. Immediate assistance for workers who lose their jobs has never been and is still not in place.That continues to be one of the Bloc Québécois' demands.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607682">We also proposed to help the most vulnerable with investments of $6 billion, starting with seniors, by increasing the guaranteed income supplement by $110 per month. For middle-class families, we proposed to double the GST tax credit for 2009.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607683">We also proposed a series of measures to support and stimulate employment and investment. Furthermore, we proposed investments to help Quebec and the provinces maintain essential services to the public. It is never a good idea to make cuts, but this is the worst time to cut Quebec's funding. And yet, that is what the Conservatives are doing by tinkering with the equalization formula to favour Ontario and by adding even more inequities, such as refusing to compensate Quebec for the harmonization of sales taxes.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607684">We asked that education transfers be restored to their 1994 levels both to stimulate the economy and to help Quebec and the provinces prepare for the future. </ParaText><ParaText id="1607685">Finally, we proposed strategic investments to reduce both our dependence on oil and our greenhouse gas emissions. The Conservatives, with the support of the Liberals, on the contrary, have abandoned Quebec industries and workers in favour of those in Ontario and the West.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607686">The federal government's bias in favour of Ontario and its auto industry is striking, as evidenced in the third progress report on the action plan. Whereas 100% of the $9.7 billion in direct federal spending for the auto industry have been spent, only 80% of the $70 billion for the development of new markets for the forest industry have been spent. In total, the government will have used only $2.1 billion from Vote 35 concurred in last spring. Yet the June report already indicated $1.85 billion in spending through this vote, which means that the government has spent only $250 million more through this vote since the last report.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="35">(1235)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1607687">I believe it is important to go back to a key point. A crisis requires quick and immediate action, particularly when jobs are lost. I may be repeating myself, but something has to be done to fix our employment insurance system. The Liberals gutted the system and the Conservatives followed in their footsteps. It is exactly because of all those things that we have no confidence in this government.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607688">With regard to EI, what needs to be done is to reduce the eligibility threshold to 360 hours for everybody, to eliminate the waiting period, to increase benefits from 55% to 60% of earnings, to increase insurable earnings to $42,500 and to base the benefit calculation on the best 12 weeks.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607689">Even if we support this bill, we still have no confidence in this government. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Today, the deficit is $56 billion or $57 billion. What is strange is that this is roughly the same amount of money that was stolen from the employment insurance fund. This year's deficit did not go toward EI to really help workers. In fact, I do not believe the government has helped the unemployed.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607697">The <Affiliation DbId="128683" Type="4">Minister of National Revenue</Affiliation> says that employment insurance programs must have a beginning, a middle and an end. With his additional five weeks of benefits, it would seem that the minister started at the end. He should have started at the beginning. He cannot even follow his own logic.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607698">All I can say is that he had a beginning a few years ago, he has more than past the middle and he is now approaching his end.

							<ParaText id="1607699">It is clear that the new employment insurance program, with additional weeks of benefits, was designed for people who are lucky enough to keep the same job for a very long time, but that it represents a trap for the NDP, because it targets Ontario specifically and does nothing to help forestry workers in Quebec.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607700">We therefore do not have confidence in this government or its policies. This government needs to be a bit more open to Quebec, practise open federalism and listen a bit more to what the opposition is saying.

Last spring, we saw in the original budget proposal that there were some benefits and some downturns.

The Canadian Association of Retired Persons (CARP), said that those recommendations were still inadequate and that 30% of Canadians were without retirement savings. As well, those proposed changes did not amount to a significant increase in income security for many seniors and did not address the need for old age security and guaranteed income supplement enhancement, which we know is critical.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607720">The other key piece, of course, is the fact that there is no retroactive claim beyond 11 months.

I know this has been a matter raised by many constituents in my own riding.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607721">The member for <Affiliation DbId="128220" Type="2">Hamilton Mountain</Affiliation> had raised in previous sessions that it would be a simple matter for the government to make some changes to the income tax system with the Canada Revenue Agency that would allow for the automatic application at the age of 65, based on income tax records.

The home renovation tax credit is such that it would allow people who have significant income to spend up to $10,000 on their homes and receive a tax credit.

What we have here, and this article talked about it, is seniors living in older housing which has not had the retrofit that is necessary to make it more energy efficient. On one hand we are talking about the fact that the Canada pension plan and old age security are not meeting the needs of many seniors who rely on them and on the other hand we have seniors who simply cannot afford to do the kinds of retrofits in their homes to save the money and reduce the impact on the environment. </ParaText><ParaText id="1607739">In that context, it would seem to make good practical sense to develop a retrofit program that would ensure that everybody has access to funds to help with the services, perhaps a tax credit that would ensure those kinds of retrofits take place.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607740">The home renovation tax credit is simply not usable by many of these seniors because first, many of them do not have much taxable income, and second, they simply cannot afford the cost of doing those kinds of retrofits.

Although this is outside of retrofits, I want to quote from this document because this House has been concerned with economic stimulus around creating jobs in communities and around ensuring that we are contributing to local economies. In its analysis, the foundation said, “Investments in energy efficiency have been found to produce four times more jobs than equivalent spending in new supplies of conventional energy”.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607742">If we wanted to look at ways of creating jobs in our communities, one of the ways that we could do it is to look at jobs in energy efficiency.

This article did address some of those solutions. </ParaText><ParaText id="1607744">With regard to taking action, which is specifically to do with residential buildings, there are some frightening numbers.

Second reading</ProceduralText><ParaText id="1607835">She said: Mr. Speaker, I first introduced a private member's bill on the right to die with dignity in June 2005, because I felt confident that Quebeckers and Canadians needed Parliament to amend the Criminal Code to recognize that every person, subject to certain specific conditions, had the right to an end of life that is consistent with the values of dignity and freedom they have always espoused and so that an individual's wish regarding his or her death would be respected. In fact, I introduced this bill so that people would have a choice, the same right to choose that people in other countries have.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607836">My conviction has grown stronger, and that is why I am introducing an amended bill on the right to die with dignity, Bill <Document DbId="3627234" Type="4">C-384</Document>. Briefly, it amends the Criminal code so that a medical practitioner does not commit homicide just by helping a person to die with dignity if—I am coming to the conditions—the person is at least 18 years of age, continues to experience severe physical or mental pain without any prospect of relief or suffers from a terminal illness. The person must have provided a medical practitioner with two written requests more than 10 days apart expressly stating the person's free and informed consent to opt to die.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607837">The medical practitioner must have requested and received written confirmation of the diagnosis from another medical practitioner. The other practitioner must be independent and have no personal interest in the death of the person. The medical practitioner must have no reasonable grounds—this is important—to believe that the person's written requests were made under duress or while the person was not lucid. The practitioner must have informed the person of the consequences of his or her requests and of the alternatives available to him or her and must act in the manner indicated by the person, it being understood that the person may, at any time, revoke the requests made under subparagraph (<I>a</I>)(iii) of clause 2 of the bill.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607838">The patient is free to change his mind. The doctor must constantly remind him of that. If he does not change his mind, the doctor must submit a copy of the confirmation referred to in subparagraph (i) to the coroner.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607839">Mr. Speaker, would you please let me know when I have two minutes left?</ParaText><ParaText id="1607840">As we all know, the right to receive medical assistance to die exists in other countries. The Netherlands was the first to make it a right. In that country, before the law existed, doctors who helped patients die were tolerated by the legal system, as long as they complied with medical directives from the country's equivalent of a college of physicians and surgeons. Then the law was changed to reflect what people had been thinking about and doing for all that time.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607841">In the Netherlands, euthanasia is when a doctor, acting on behalf of a patient and in accordance with the patient's strict instructions, deliberately puts an end to the patient's life. I want to emphasize that, in the Netherlands, palliative care is excellent and euthanasia is one of the care options.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607842">Belgium also passed a law after senators from different parties worked together to hold nationwide consultations and agree on a piece of legislation in which euthanasia is defined as an action by a party intentionally ending the life of a person at that person's request. The law has been in place for six years, and there is oversight in place as well. This year, there was a report on the application of the law. For those who fear that permitting people at the end of their lives to choose how they wish to die might result in a huge number of people seeking help to die, the incidence over the past six years in Belgium has been 4 per 1,000. I repeat: 4 per 1,000 deaths. </ParaText><ParaText id="1607843">In Quebec, the debate is ongoing. The Collège des médecins has asked its ethics committee to consider the matter of euthanasia. After three years of study, the committee should soon be making recommendations.

							<ParaText id="1607846"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1"> I have found that over the years in Canada, palliative care has been championed as the anti-euthanasia and the universal alternative to an act punishable under the laws of God, the laws of man and the laws of the college of physicians.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1607847">He added:</ParaText><ParaText id="1607848"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">There are people who believe that “increased development of palliative care means there is no longer a need for suicide, assisted suicide and euthanasia.”</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1607849">I could go on. On August 11, 2009, an Angus Reid survey of 804 adults in Quebec was published with the title, <I>Strong Support in Quebec for Legalizing Euthanasia</I>. The subtitle read, “Most Quebecers believe that laws governing euthanasia should be provincial responsibility.” The survey showed the following figures: 77% of Quebeckers believe euthanasia should be allowed, and 75% think it is a good idea to re-open the debate on euthanasia. On August 22, the Association féminine d'éducation et d'affaires sociales, the AFEAS, well-known in all ridings of Quebec, voted in favour of euthanasia at its convention. Members of the AFEAS took the position that Quebeckers should be allowed to die with dignity.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607850">Palliative care and assisted suicide are not mutually exclusive; they complement each other. I am saying this right off the bat, because I know that I will hear that argument. How many times have I heard, “As long as some people do not have access to palliative care, we cannot consider medical assistance in dying”? Why? That has nothing to do with the issue. Everyone needs access to quality palliative care.</ParaText>

Again, palliative care cannot end all pain and suffering.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607857">My colleagues may have received the document from five doctors who oppose my bill. They may have the support of a hundred or so others. What do they have to say? I read this document carefully and it acknowledges that palliative care cannot relieve all pain and suffering and certainly not the suffering described by Dr. Boisvert. Then why are they against my bill?</ParaText><ParaText id="1607858">They say, “These people have to be heard and helped as much as possible, but their request remains absolutely unacceptable to us”.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607859">Why?

							<ParaText id="1607861">They wrote that because palliative care also uses what is known as terminal sedation, which plunges patients into a coma when their suffering cannot otherwise be eased. In such a coma, they cannot eat or drink, but they are still alive and, in the end, they die of lethal complications. This can take a short while or a very long time, and this terminal sedation basically amounts to an act of euthanasia. They claim it is not the same thing. Even the Catholic church says that when any action is taken that has a double effect, such as the positive effect of easing the suffering, and the negative effect, which leads to death, one is not responsible for the negative effect, because it was the positive effect that was sought. This was one of the teachings of Saint Thomas Aquinas.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607862">When we consider that, not as followers of any religion, but as people who are responsible for the well being of our citizens, do we have the right to refuse to look at all the possibilities?</ParaText><ParaText id="1607863">I would like to see the broadest possible committee hear from as many citizens as possible in order to be able to provide end of life medical assistance to people who are suffering greatly, who can no longer endure the suffering and want to end their lives.

Two previous bills on this subject were introduced by the same member in past sessions of Parliament. One of them was debated in 2005, but did not come to a vote.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607887">Mr. Speaker, I would like to state at the outset that I do not support Bill C-384 which proposes the legalization of physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia under specified conditions. This bill raises a number of serious concerns and I propose to outline the ones I consider to be most important. </ParaText><ParaText id="1607888">First, Bill C-384 is too broad in terms of its scope. Mr. Speaker, Bill C-384 proposes to amend the Criminal Code to provide an exemption not only to the offence of assisted suicide, but also to the offence of murder. These amendments would represent a substantial change to the current state of the law on a matter that touches on life and death.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607889">The proposed legalization of medical euthanasia and assisted suicide would not only apply to terminally-ill patients, but also to persons who suffer from severe physical or mental pain without any prospect of relief. Therefore, under this bill, persons who suffer from depression could request that a doctor help them to commit suicide. They could also request that the doctor carry out the act itself that would cause their death. </ParaText><ParaText id="1607890"><B>Ms. Diane Bourgeois:</B> That is false.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607891"><B>Mr. Jacques Gourde:</B> Therefore, when I articulated earlier that Bill C-384 is too broad in its scope, this concern applies to both the fact that it would permit physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia, and to the fact that it would allow a vast array of persons to make a request to a doctor for assisted death.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607892">The second important concern I wish to raise with respect to this bill is how it does not encompass sufficient safeguards.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607893">The subject of safeguards, like the subject of the scope, also has two aspects in the context of this bill. </ParaText><ParaText id="1607894">The first deals with ensuring that the eligibility requirements and the terms used are properly circumscribed.

The House is at third reading of a bill that would, in some circumstances, allow a physician to aid a person to die with dignity if that person has provided free and informed consent. The CMA's policy is clear. “Canadian physicians should not participate in euthanasia or assisted suicide.”</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1607908"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">As the attached policy notes, euthanasia and assisted suicide must be distinguished from the withholding or withdrawal of inappropriate, futile or unwanted medical treatment or the provision of compassionate palliative care, even when these practices shorten life. The CMA does not support euthanasia or assisted suicide and urges its members to uphold the principles of palliative care. Euthanasia and assisted suicide are opposed by almost every national medical association and prohibited by the law codes of almost all countries. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1607909"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Our policies also clearly state that “the CMA recognizes that it is the prerogative of society to decide whether the laws dealing with euthanasia and assisted suicide should be changed”, but that there are some concerns that must be addressed before any changes are made.

Adequate palliative-care services must be made available to all Canadians. In 1994, our members approved a motion that Canadian physicians should uphold the principles of palliative care. The public has clearly demonstrated its concern with our care of the dying. The provision of palliative care for all who are in need is a mandatory precondition to the contemplation of permissive legislative change.

Suicide-prevention programs should be maintained and strengthened where necessary. Although attempted suicide is not illegal, it is often the result of temporary depression or unhappiness. Society rightly supports efforts to prevent suicide, and physicians are expected to provide life-support measures to people who have attempted suicide. In any debate about providing assistance in suicide to relieve the suffering of persons with incurable diseases, the interests of those at risk of attempting suicide for other reasons must be safeguarded. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1607912"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">3.

This evaluation would help determine the possible need for change and identify what those changes should be.

It is certainly a very emotional one, and it is one to which there is no clear solution.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607925">I will start off by saying, as I have regarding the previous incarnations of the bill, that I am opposed to the bill, and I am opposed to introducing into Canada assisted suicide at this time. I want to say that philosophically I understand the arguments. I have to say I may even be inclined in extreme cases to agree that we need, in those rare cases, an assisted-suicide system. However, that is not where we are at as a society now. I believe it would be a tragedy and a major mistake if we moved to assisted suicide in this country at this time. </ParaText><ParaText id="1607926">I must admit I deliberated quite extensively over whether I should support the bill to get it through second reading and to committee, and ultimately I decided that I was philosophically opposed to it at this time, but more important, I decided that the debate we would have around the bill is not the debate that we need in the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607927">The misinformation that we have around assisted suicides and around end-of-life decisions is quite grotesque.

One, the reality is that we do not train our doctors. I have been told to be careful about being overly critical of them, but it is the reality of our medical training. We do not train our doctors anywhere near sufficiently in pain control: pain control techniques and mechanisms and pharmacology.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607930">I come from a community that has a hospice, which I believe is the best in the country. It has been in place for almost 25 years. It has gone out of its way to train local doctors by mentoring. Unfortunately, there was a pain specialist who recently retired. It has been training its doctors in this area, but it is an exception to the rest of the country.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607931">There are all sorts of doctors, including some specialists I think should know better, who believe sincerely that there are a large number of cases in which they cannot control the pain and provide people with dignity at the end of their lives.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607932">I want to quote from a statement made by Dr. Balfour Mount, whose name I think everybody in the country would recognize as being the leading doctor in palliative care. He started palliative care. He teaches at McGill University in Montreal. </ParaText><ParaText id="1607933">We know from what has gone on this past summer in Quebec that physicians' associations there are looking at whether they are going to come onside the euthanasia position. This is what Dr. Mount said:</ParaText><ParaText id="1607934"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">--the debate should be about the doctor's role in accompanying a terminally ill patient towards the inevitability of death, offering as much dignity and medical assistance as possible.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1607935">That is not the same as saying that we should kill people.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607936"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">Mount said he is profoundly against euthanasia because it is simply not needed...<Query></Query></QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1607937">What he was saying is that it is not needed in the kind of care he is able to provide and that he has provided for the better part of 30 years, as is the case in my community.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607938">I have spoken to Carol Derbyshire, who is the head of the hospice. She said the hospice does not get requests for assisted suicide. They provide the care, not just to the patient but to the family. She was very clear on that. She has seen any number of surveys that say one of the major reasons, aside from pain, that people want assisted suicide in their regime is that they do not want to be a burden on their family, their society, their community. If we can build that system to make sure they do not have to be concerned about that, we take away any desire to terminate their lives arbitrarily and at an earlier date than would be natural.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607939">We need to look at our system right now. Like the previous speaker, I want to be somewhat critical of prior governments. At this point, approximately 20% of our population is covered by meaningful palliative care, hospice and a home care system. That is all we have in the country. Then there is another 15% or maybe 17% who are covered by partial assistance at the end of life.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607940">As an aside, one of the other things Carol said to me is that we have to shift the debate from dying to living out our lives. She is trying to come up with a phraseology that I may be able to use.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607941">However, that is what it is about. It is about providing that system, and we are not doing it. In the last few months the government has cut more funding, the last of the funding it was providing for palliative care. It was mostly for research and helping the provinces set up standards. That is the second cut. Now all funds at the federal level have been eliminated to aid the provinces in establishing educational standards and training standards for palliative care in hospices. The government has cut it all. </ParaText><ParaText id="1607942">The other thing the government has not done, which is another area we need to be working on, is expanding EI benefits for family members who are caring for their parents or a sibling or spouse in need of that kind of assistance. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="15">(1415)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1607943"> We have so severely restricted those funds as to make them almost meaningless. That is another area where we could be doing something that would take away the need for this kind of legislation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607944">We need to train our doctors much better, and we need to build the system. Until we do that, we should not be looking at this kind of legislation. I say that because I have also studied the situation in the Netherlands, Belgium and Oregon fairly extensively. Although they all have different systems of determining when doctors can assist suicide or an individual can get assistance for suicide, the same result is true in all those communities.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607945"> I know there are disputes over this, but it is the analysis that I have brought to bear, and I think it is an accurate one. In spite of how we build that system, and I say that about the legislation my colleague has brought here, that is not what actually happens. Should we make the mistake of passing this kind of legislation, we are in effect giving our approval to doctors who are willing to do this, to family members who want it and to those individuals who are still capable of making a decision. They will simply figure out ways of working around the legislation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607946">I respect my colleague from the Bloc extensively. The work she has done on foreign affairs and human rights in this country is almost beyond compare. I do not know if anybody's work is superior to the work she has done. However, I think she is wrong on this one.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607947">I say this as a practising lawyer. I look at the terminology that she used, in particular where we are assessing the patient. She has set out a standard in this legislation about apparent lucidity. That is the terminology. That does not exist anywhere else in the law that I am aware of. If this test were to be applied, it would be easier for a person to commit suicide than it would be for somebody to take over control of their finances. That is simply wrong.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607948">I am running out of time. I think we do need a fuller debate on this, but not in this context. It has to be in the context of people living out their natural lives, and what we, as a society and legislators, have to do to ensure that can happen.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<FloorLanguage language="FR">[<I>Translation</I>]</FloorLanguage><Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Cardin" id="2876610"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128135" Type="2">Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1607949">Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to congratulate and thank my colleague, the hon. member for <Affiliation DbId="128535" Type="2">La Pointe-de-l'Île</Affiliation>, who, for a third time, is introducing this bill concerning the right to die with dignity. We could call it the freedom to die with dignity. Clearly, for many people, when they hear that, they hear “suicide”, “assisted suicide” or “euthanasia”, and yes, it makes us shiver, because we have probably all known, every one of the 308 members have probably known someone directly or indirectly who has committed suicide, although no one expected it. We are always surprised. That person was probably suffering, suffering more than anyone can imagine.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607950">We now have resources to help these people, but we have to find them and help them, for they will continue to suffer until we help them. Getting to the point of assisted suicide, this means that the someone is suffering, and there are situations in which there is nothing we can do. That person is suffering, and is becoming something that he or she never thought possible, bent over in pain, or often not bent over, but bedridden and suffering for weeks and months on end, which to that person seems like an eternity. This bill does not seek to eliminate people who are suffering. That is not what we are asking for; rather, we are seeking a right for these people, people who have all their faculties about them, who are suffering, who are aware of their suffering and who want to escape it. These people could commit suicide on their own and no one could stop them. However, some people have philosophical or religious considerations. Philosophy and religion eventually cross paths.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607951">I can say that in ancient times, the Greeks and the Romans were able to bring the issue of suicide out into the open and ensure that it was part of public discourse and debate. That was in ancient times. They decided to discuss it honestly and openly, to debate the matter. Intolerance of suicide began to take root in the 2nd and 3rd centuries and was heightened under the influence of Christianity. Naturally we do not wish to go against people's beliefs. However, we are talking about the right to die with dignity. Some people fear that we are confusing palliative care with assisted suicide, that we are taking sides.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607952">I have experienced this suffering. Who among us has not gone through the experience of watching a loved one die of cancer? Who has not experienced that? If I look at some of the reactions, what is happening now is not any better than what we are asking for. What we are asking for is to allow people to make a free and informed choice. You have probably all seen a loved one go through cancer. At a certain point, the suffering is intolerable. Of course the person is given morphine. At first things are better, but in the long run it is not enough. What to do? How long do we let them lie there unconscious? Are the doctors not somehow assisting them? Some people have a strong heart and their life, which they are no longer conscious of, will continue for as long as their heart beats. </ParaText><ParaText id="1607953">My father, who died at age 68, started having strokes at age 63, shortly after he retired.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="20">(1420)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1607954">He had various handicaps in addition to Alzheimer's disease. Of course there came a time when he had to be hospitalized. He was bedridden and unconscious for weeks, months. My father was strong and he had a healthy heart despite the fact that he was unconscious. It is normal for a human body to want to continue living.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607955">We say that we want what is best for society, yet the fact that we refuse to speak openly and honestly about this issue raises a question. How can we be thinking of what is best for society when confronted with an individual in the final stages of a terminal illness who knows that they will die sooner or later and asks to die with dignity, thereby minimizing their own suffering and that of the people close to them?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607956">I went through a second experience because I was also there when my father-in-law died in my home. He had been receiving palliative care. CLSC staff came to take care of him regularly. The same thing happened: doctors said that they might be able to help the end come sooner. In that case, the patient did not make a request.</ParaText><ParaText id="1607957">This bill covers requests by lucid individuals. If a sick but lucid person decides to end their life with dignity—and everyone knows that they are going to die anyway—who am I to refuse?</ParaText><ParaText id="1607958">We know that such pacts are becoming more and more common. When people know that they cannot end their own lives, they ask another person to help them in the event it becomes necessary. It is not very nice to be asked to do this kind of thing. How heartbreaking. But if there is a legal framework and people can make an informed choice, what right do we have to refuse them? Who am I to decide whether a human being should live or die? I believe that only the dying person has the right to decide whether they want to live or die.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1607959">I am certain that if we do not have this debate, more and more cases will come before the courts. People will be faced with such situations and, out of compassion, will decide that they cannot continue to watch loved ones suffer and that they must help them because their loved ones have asked for their help. Who am I to decide that someone will continue to suffer, continue to be bedridden, continue to decline, continue to no longer be the person they once were and no longer know where they are, even though that person asked me to do something for them if this sort of situation should occur?</ParaText><ParaText id="1607960">In my opinion, we, the 308 members of this House, have a duty to consider this issue. I am not trying to convince the members to say yes so that this bill becomes law tomorrow morning. What I am trying to do is convince them to consider, discuss, debate and improve this bill. In the end, it is not up to us to choose. It is up to the person to say lucidly that, in the event something should happen, they want to have control over their life and, ideally, their death as well.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
