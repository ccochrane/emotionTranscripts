					<Intervention Type="Debate" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Duncan (Vancouver Island North)" id="3063699"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128845" Type="18">Mr. John Duncan (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, CPC)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1830945">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak to Bill <Document DbId="4336828" Type="3">C-3, Gender Equity in Indian Registration Act</Document> and explain why I encourage all members of the House to join me in supporting it.</ParaText><ParaText id="1830946">Bill <Document DbId="4336828" Type="3">C-3</Document> proposes to accomplish two objectives. First, this legislation would remove a cause of gender discrimination in the Indian Act. Second, it would meet the deadline imposed upon Parliament in a ruling of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia. </ParaText><ParaText id="1830947">My remarks today will describe not only how Bill C-3 achieves these objectives, but also how it would serve the larger national interest.</ParaText><ParaText id="1830948">In last year's decision by the Court of Appeal for B.C. in McIvor v. Canada, the court ruled that the two paragraphs in section 6 of the Indian Act discriminate between men and women with respect to registration as an Indian and therefore violate the equality provision of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. </ParaText><ParaText id="1830949">Rather than have the decision take effect right away, the court suspended the effects of the decision until April 6, 2010, and explicitly called on Parliament to enact an effective legislative solution. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1830950">What this means is we have until April 6 to implement a solution and if we fail to meet this deadline a key section of the Indian Act, one that spells out rules related to entitlement to registration also known as Indian status, will cease to have legal effect in the province of British Columbia. </ParaText><ParaText id="1830951">This will have some significant consequences. As the members of the House will recognize, Indian status is a legal concept that confers a particular set of rights and entitlements. Should the two paragraphs of section 6 cease to have legal effect, it would lead to uncertainty and confusion about entitlements to registration in British Columbia.</ParaText><ParaText id="1830952"> The legislation now before us proposes to avert these consequences by amending certain registration provisions of the Indian Act. The bill addresses the root of the problem by removing the language that the court ruled unconstitutional.</ParaText><ParaText id="1830953">I have no doubt that every member of the House stands opposed to discrimination based on gender. Despite this conviction, I expect that all members appreciate that equality between men and women is difficult to achieve at times. </ParaText><ParaText id="1830954">Bill <Document DbId="4336828" Type="3">C-3</Document> would take Canada one significant step closer to this important goal and this is what this debate is all about, the ongoing effort to eliminate gender discrimination.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1830955">Parliament, of course, has played an important role in taking corrective actions to address this issue. For example, the House endorsed the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which is recognized internationally as a milestone in the fight against discrimination. To understand the origins of the McIvor decision we must go back to the 1980s when the charter was first enacted. </ParaText><ParaText id="1830956">The charter required the Government of Canada to amend or rescind federal legislation that caused, aided or abetted discrimination based on gender. A significant effort was undertaken to amend the Indian Act, which clearly discriminated against women.</ParaText><ParaText id="1830957">Perhaps the most egregious example of this discrimination was the Indian Act's treatment of a status Indian who married someone without status. If the status Indian were a woman, she would immediately lose her status. If the status Indian were a man, he would retain his status and furthermore his wife would become entitled to registration. </ParaText><ParaText id="1830958">So these effects were dramatically different of course on their children. Children of a woman who lost status and her non-Indian husband were not entitled to registration, while children of a status man and his non-Indian wife were entitled to registration.</ParaText><ParaText id="1830959">A provision in the former Indian Act, which was commonly referred to as the “double mother clause”, discriminated against children whose mother and paternal grandmother gained status upon marriage. These children, born after September 4, 1951, would lose their Indian status at age 21.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1830960">In an effort to eliminate these types of discrimination, Parliament endorsed a series of amendments to the Indian Act in 1985. These amendments are still known, colloquially, as Bill C-31 changes, and they remain controversial and lie at the heart of the McIvor ruling at the Court of Appeal for British Columbia.</ParaText><ParaText id="1830961">The problem lies with the mechanisms that Bill C-31 used to rectify gender discrimination related to status entitlement and registration. I will do my best to simplify two of the key amendments from 1985.</ParaText><ParaText Interjection="e1" id="1830962"><Affiliation DbId="128212" Type="2">Mr. Gary Schellenberger: </Affiliation> Good luck.</ParaText><ParaText id="1830963"><Affiliation DbId="128845">Mr. John Duncan: </Affiliation>Yes. “Good luck”, somebody just said.</ParaText><ParaText id="1830964">Subsection 6.(1) provided a way for Indian women who had lost status through marriage to regain it and subsection 6.(2) made it possible for the children of these women to be registered.</ParaText><ParaText id="1830965">Although this approach earned the approval of Parliament, and many other groups, subsequent generations were still subject to residual gender discrimination, and that is what was ruled on by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia.</ParaText><ParaText id="1830966">Now, let me provide members with a little history to the court's decision. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1830967">Sharon McIvor is an Indian woman who married a non-Indian man before 1985. They had children together. According to the Indian Act, at that time, Ms. McIvor would have lost her status and her children would not be eligible for registration.</ParaText><ParaText id="1830968">Through the amendments to the Indian Act, in 1985, Ms. McIvor was registered in accordance with subsection 6.(1) and her son was registered under subsection 6.(2). When this son had a child with a non-Indian woman, their children were not eligible for registration. This fact formed the basis for Sharon McIvor's arguments in McIvor v. Canada: that her descendants were not in the same position to transmit registration to their children as they would be if she were male.</ParaText><ParaText id="1830969">To determine if this constituted bona fide discrimination, the Court of Appeal for British Columbia reviewed the Indian Act's provisions for registration following the Bill C-31 amendments to the Indian Act in 1985. The court specifically examined Ms. McIvor's situation in comparison to that of a brother. It found that the consequences of two successive generations of parenting with non-Indians actually significantly differed in the male and female lines.</ParaText><ParaText id="1830970">While the 1985 amendments in Bill C-31 succeeded in eliminating gender discrimination in the first generation, it failed to eliminate it in subsequent generations. This is the core, essentially, of the court's ruling.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1830971">It is important to note that Bill <Document DbId="4336828" Type="3">C-3</Document> responds directly to the court's decision by amending certain provisions of section 6 of the Indian Act. By any measure, this is a progressive and desirable step because it removes an identified cause of gender discrimination.</ParaText><ParaText id="1830972">As a modern nation, Canada champions justice and equality for all. Canadians recognize that discrimination does weaken the fabric of our society and erodes public faith in our justice system. That is why I am pleased to bring forward this legislation identified in the court's decision.</ParaText><ParaText id="1830973">Members of this House have demonstrated over and over again that willingness to address issues related to individual rights. It is something they wish to do. In 2008 Parliament supported the repeal of section 67 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, for example. Section 67 of this act had created an exception so that complaints for people subject to the provisions of the Indian Act could not seek redress under the Canadian Human Rights Act, which was the only exception for Canadians in the act. To rectify this situation, members of the House supported legislation to repeal this section.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="10">(1010)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1830974">Bill <Document DbId="4336828" Type="3">C-3</Document> has much in common with the legislation that repealed this section of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Both strive to protect individual rights and promote equality. Putting an end to discrimination against first nations women is advantageous for all Canadians, which is why I am asking members to support this bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="1830975">When speaking about protecting human rights, I would also like to take this opportunity to remind members of the House that this government has been actively seeking to address a legislative gap that undermines our justice system. I am talking about matrimonial real property legislation. I am talking about eliminating the gap that leaves first nations people, most often women and children, vulnerable and without legal protection.</ParaText><ParaText id="1830976">Addressing issues such as gender discrimination in certain registration provisions in the Indian Act, repealing section 67, and filling a legislative gap respecting matrimonial real property will have positive and lasting impacts. For too long aboriginal people have struggled to participate fully in the prosperity of the nation due to a series of obstacles. By removing these obstacles, Canada enables aboriginal people to contribute socially, economically and culturally to this country. Parliament must play its key role in this process.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1830977">We should consider the Specific Claims Tribunal Act. The legislation was a crucial component in a larger action plan to resolve another major obstacle to good relations between first nations and the federal government, and that was a backlog of unresolved specific claims. Thanks in part to the House's endorsement of the Specific Claims Tribunal Act, every claim settled brings a first nation one step closer to realizing its full potential.</ParaText><ParaText id="1830978">To help achieve similar progress, the government has taken action on a number of issues, from human rights to other basics, such as drinking water, education and housing. A multifaceted and collaborative action plan continues to increase the number of first nation communities with access to safe and reliable supplies of drinking water. </ParaText><ParaText id="1830979">A series of tripartite partnerships with individual provinces and first nation groups continues to generate improvements in on-reserve educational outcomes and the quality of child and family services. The government is acting in collaboration with the people directly affected by the issues at play and Bill <Document DbId="4336828" Type="3">C-3</Document> is no exception.</ParaText><ParaText id="1830980">Last year, following a thorough review and analysis of the court's decision, department officials had technical briefings with representatives of five national aboriginal organizations to discuss the decision and Canada's proposed response. Following those briefings, 15 engagement sessions were held throughout the country to present Canada's proposed response to the McIvor decision and solicit feedback. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1830981">To help focus the sessions, the Government of Canada researched, published and distributed copies of a discussion paper. Hundreds of participants came to the engagement sessions and many written submissions were received. </ParaText><ParaText id="1830982">We had several common themes emerge during the sessions and in the written submissions. Many people were expressing concerns about the broader issues of registration, membership and citizenship. </ParaText><ParaText id="1830983">Based on the views expressed during this engagement process, we announced broader measures that extend beyond the scope of the bill before us and will be discussed in a separate forum. This will be done in partnership with national aboriginal organizations and will involve the participation of first nations and other aboriginal groups, organizations and individuals at all levels. </ParaText><ParaText id="1830984">The findings of the exploratory process will form the federal government's next steps regarding further initiatives on these issues. As important as all of this work might be, it cannot take precedence over the importance of passing Bill <Document DbId="4336828" Type="3">C-3</Document>. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="15">(1015)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1830985">We must not lose sight of the fact that the legislation now before us responds to a specific court ruling and prescribed deadline. The ruling and deadline inform the design of Bill <Document DbId="4336828" Type="3">C-3</Document>. The proposed legislation is a precise, compact and focused response.</ParaText><ParaText id="1830986">As Bill <Document DbId="4336828" Type="3">C-3</Document> proceeds through the parliamentary process, the plan is to work in partnership with first nations and other aboriginal groups and organizations to identify and discuss the critical issues surrounding registration, membership and citizenship. This process will be separate from Bill <Document DbId="4336828" Type="3">C-3</Document> in recognition of the court's deadline and the importance of acting quickly to address the situation of gender discrimination in the Indian Act.</ParaText><ParaText id="1830987">Bill <Document DbId="4336828" Type="3">C-3</Document> is progressive, responsive and measured. It is rooted in the principle that all citizens should be equal before the law.</ParaText><ParaText id="1830988"> Bill <Document DbId="4336828" Type="3">C-3</Document> represents a timely and appropriate response to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia's ruling. It proposes to eliminate a cause of unjust discrimination and ensure that Canada's legal system continues to evolve alongside the needs of aboriginal peoples.</ParaText><ParaText id="1830989">I urge all members of the House to join me in supporting Bill <Document DbId="4336828" Type="3">C-3</Document>. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

How does the member feel prorogation affected the timing? </ParaText><ParaText id="1830993">It is my understanding that the minister or the government has asked the B.C. Court of Appeal for an extension. I may be correct or incorrect on that particular assumption, but has the government asked for extension and, if so, what was the reply?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Interjection" ToC="No" ToCText="Mr. Duncan (Vancouver Island North)" id="3063722"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128845" Type="18">Mr. John Duncan</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1830994">Mr. Speaker, in terms of the request for an extension from the courts, we did ask for an extension but we have not heard a response.</ParaText><ParaText id="1830995">I did make a commitment in the aboriginal affairs committee that as soon as we received a response I would certainly let the other parties know, although I think it would generally be a matter of public knowledge at that time in any case.</ParaText><ParaText id="1830996">In terms of the timing of getting this bill before Parliament, we are doing quite well. This is our second week here and I have been pressing to get this bill before the House, which I have, and I think we will give it quick passage through second reading and then into committee where we can deal with it.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
					<Intervention Type="Question" ToC="Yes" ToCText="Mr. Martin (Winnipeg Centre)" id="3063724"><PersonSpeaking><Affiliation DbId="128421" Type="2">Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP)</Affiliation>: </PersonSpeaking><Content><ParaText id="1830997">Mr. Speaker, would the <Affiliation DbId="128845" Type="18">parliamentary secretary</Affiliation> agree with me that perhaps he should have prefaced his comments with the statement that this House of Commons, this Parliament believes that the Indian Act is a paternalistic, obnoxious instrument of oppression that is unworthy of any western democracy and, in fact, is unworthy of any civilized free society?</ParaText><ParaText id="1830998">I believe that the parliamentary secretary could have prefaced his remarks by recognizing that the social condition and the status of aboriginal people in our culture is perhaps Canada's greatest shame, and that there is and should be a sense of urgency to remedy some of the historic atrocities contained within the Indian Act.</ParaText><ParaText id="1830999">Perhaps he should have acknowledged that the Indian Act was really designed as an instrument, not only of oppression but of extinction. In fact, it had recipes for extinction built into it. For instance, when a 6(1)(a) Indian, they categorized rights as 6, chapter (1) section (a), and a 6, chapter (1), section (c), marry. the results shall have a 6(1)(c) that forfeits their rights. It is not called disenfranchised. It is called enfranchising because they then become full status human beings as non-Indians.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831000">I would just like my colleague to acknowledge and perhaps explain the position of his government. Does he acknowledge that Bill <Document DbId="4336828" Type="3">C-3</Document> does not confer rights on aboriginal women, that this bill recognizes and finally acknowledges the inherent rights of those people who gained those rights by their birthright not bestowed upon by the government?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We also have bands that have chosen to remain strictly under the Indian Act provisions that will have members added to their roles through the bill.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831003">Therefore, there is no single response or catch-all phrase, but this is a narrow targeted and focused bill.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

Canada (Registrar of Indian and Northern Affairs)</Document>. </ParaText><ParaText id="1831018">The bill is in response to a long-running battle in the courts spearheaded by Sharon McIvor. This action is being taken because the courts have said that the government must take action on this particular case. I congratulate Sharon McIvor and the others who have walked with her on the journey to heal the wounds of inequality and injustice.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831019">It is pertinent for the House to know that it has taken 20 years. The court case was launched in 1989 and it took 17 years, until 2006, for it to be heard. Every obstacle was thrown in the way. I will not get into a debate about what government was in power when. The case was launched under the Mulroney government, carried on under the Chrétien and Martin governments, and continued on under the present <Affiliation DbId="78738" Type="1">Prime Minister's</Affiliation> government. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831020">However, there is something wrong with the system when it takes 20 years in the courts to resolve an issue of inequity. It takes time and resources and eats up people's lives, and we are talking about people's lives. I really do not care what government was in power. There must be a better way. There are smart lawyers in the Department of Justice. Someone must have sat back and thought that this really was an issue of inequity. They must have wondered if there was a better way to deal with it, such as through discussion or negotiation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831021">I note as well that, when it comes to resources, Sharon McIvor used the court challenges program, as have many other women, to try to advance their particular cause of equity. It was in 2006 that the current government killed the court challenges program that promoted the cause of equity. That added further to Sharon's struggle for money to see this case through to its successful conclusion, at least in some people's minds.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831022">Does the title of this bill accurately reflect the intent of the bill, which is to provide equity? Many would argue that it tries to achieve that particular objective but it would be wrong for the House to think that this legislation would resolve all of the issues of inequity based on sex or on one's maternal line. Many other issues have not been addressed.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831023">Let us take a quick look at what Bill <Document DbId="4336828" Type="3">C-3</Document> is about and put it into context.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831024">The McIvor case was the first of many cases to reach a decision under section 6 of the Indian Act. The case is about Indian status. It does not talk about band membership, citizenship or section 35 rights.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831025">Sharon McIvor challenged the constitutionality of the Indian Act under section 6 as a violation of section 15 of the charter. The argument was that there was preferential treatment for descendants who traced their Indian ancestry along the paternal line over those who traced their ancestry along the maternal line, and that there was preferential treatment for male Indians who married non-Indians and their descendants over female Indians who married non-Indians and their descendants.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831026">The B.C. Supreme Court ruled in favour of Sharon McIvor. It said that there was discrimination on the basis of sex and matrimonial descendance and ordered that section 6 was of no force and effect only with respect to the conferral of Indian status. The order resulted in inequality, the B.C. Supreme Court ruled, regarding the passage of status.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831027">However, even though Sharon McIvor had won, Canada appealed the decision to the B.C. Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal found discrimination in section 6 as well but on a much narrower basis. The court said that Bill C-31 created a new inequality because it enhanced the position of those affected by the double mother rule. Children of non-Indian mothers and non-Indian paternal grandmothers lost status at age 21 but restoring their status in section 6(1) meant that they could pass status regardless of the status of one parent. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="35">(1035)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1831028">The court only struck down sections that gave this enhanced status, and that is sections 6(1)(a) and 6(1)(c), so the ruling was in relation to a more limited category of people affected, which is why the government did not appeal because there were protected vested rights. The court gave the federal government one year to amend this provision. </ParaText><ParaText id="1831029">Sharon McIvor in fact felt that even though she had won, the ruling was not what she wanted or felt she needed to resolve the issue of inequity. She filed for a leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. The appeal was denied on November 5, 2009.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831030">The B.C. Court of Appeal's decision does not result in those who are already registered under the impugn provisions being struck off the registry, which basically means nobody will lose the rights they now have under the Indian Act, as this would result in a charter challenge itself.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831031">What was the government's response? The government had a deadline to meet of April 6 of this year. The court said that it would give the government one year to bring in the legislation to deal with the inequity under section 6 of the Indian Act. The government released a discussion paper outlining what some of the options might be, some of the processes that it would go through. It then went through an engagement process. Engagement is an important word. It is not a consultation process because the government felt it had no legal requirement to consult, but only to engage the opinions of people to listen.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831032">People had problems with that. People felt the engagement process was limited. Only about 150 individual submissions were made to the department. There were some regional and national meetings, but people, as a whole, felt it was very limited, that they did not get the full range of views they should have on this important legislation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831033">After the engagement process, the government gave notice that it would table a bill back in December. We were informed that the bill would be narrowly scoped to only deal with the equality as set out by the B.C. Court of Appeal. The government did admit that it would only deal with the B.C. Court of Appeal decision, that it would not deal with other issues arising out of the Indian Act, other issues of inequality or discrimination that exist.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831034">Up against this April 6 timeline set by the Court of Appeal, the government has now brought forth legislation at the eleventh hour. The timing constraint is certainly compounded, and was compounded, by the prorogation of Parliament, which removed many days from the parliamentary calendar. I know the government says it is serious, but if it is serious about getting the legislation through, then annual prorogations are not the way to do it. </ParaText><ParaText id="1831035">In examining this bill, we want to be diligent, we want to be expeditious, but we should not be rushed.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831036"> When we look at some of the content of the bill, people have written to me and to the department. They have indicated there are certain provisions of the proposed legislation that are still very problematic, and that they may raise other potentially new cases of discrimination. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831037">I refer to a briefing note, a submission that was made by Dr. Pamela Palmater, who did her doctoral thesis on the Indian Act and the whole issue of status and the conferral of status. I will only refer to one section, just to give members and those who are listening a sense of where some other issues of discrimination may arise.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831038">She says that section 6(c.1)(iv) of the proposed Bill <Document DbId="4336828" Type="3">C-3</Document> provides that a person:</ParaText><ParaText id="1831039"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="2">—had or adopted a child, on or after September 4, 1951, with a person who was not entitled to be registered on the day on which the child was born or adopted;</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="40">(1040)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1831040">She says:</ParaText><ParaText id="1831041"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">This section has the effect of creating a new way to determine entitlement to registration and, as a result, creates a new form of discrimination as between the siblings of the Indian women who married out. What this additional criterion does is determine entitlement to registration based on the status or lack thereof of the applicant's children. Status has always been determined based on the entitlement of one's parents, i.e. parents transmit their status to their children - not vice versa.</QuotePara></Quote>
							</ParaText><ParaText id="1831042">I mention this because the committee will have to take the time to understand what the implications are of this legislation. We do not want to make the situation worse. We want to improve the situation. We want to respond effectively and efficiently to the B.C. Court of Appeal's decision.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831043">Neither does the legislation address the second generation product rule or situations of undeclared or unknown paternity. Again, these are matters that the committee will seriously have to consider.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831044">The case is also shrouded in other fundamental rights issues, which the Government of Canada says this bill does not raise. I tend to agree that the bill does not raise these issues, the issues of jurisdiction, who determines citizenship, who determines membership. Why do we have a very paternalistic piece of legislation, one of the greatest examples of colonial infrastructure left in the western world that determines who is Indian and who is not. It is not determined by birth, by culture or by descendancy. It is determined by a statute in the House. There is definitely something wrong with the legislation, for which there are many descriptions. We are only dealing with one part of it now, but this whole bill raises other fundamental issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831045">People ask this question. Why should Canada interfere in the determination of who can be registered as an Indian under the Indian Act? They say that it contravenes international conventions like the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People, which states that indigenous people have the right to determine their own identity or membership in accordance with their customs and traditions. This does not impair the right of indigenous individuals to obtain citizenship of the state in which they live.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831046">Indigenous peoples have the right to determine their own identity or their own membership. I believe all members of the House would agree. Hopefully in the future we will be able to deal with these matters. The government acknowledged that by announcing an exploratory process to deal with these more substantive and fundamental questions.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831047">The government should not delay or prolong that process. National aboriginal groups, regional aboriginal groups and individuals want to see this go forward in an expeditious manner. We want to ensure that it is done in a proper way and properly resourced, and let us call it a consultation process as opposed to an exploratory process.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831048">We also have to be cognizant of questions around implementation. Is the department ready? Is the Office of the Indian Registrar ready? Are people being notified of possible changes that are coming? It will not be automatic that one gets status. The fact is people will have to apply and provide documentation, so there will be an onus on individuals to provide, in some cases, some very personal information. That in itself can be problematic, but is the system ready to take on new registrants?</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831049">Also, what are the impacts? There is a possibility that there could be up to 45,000 new registrants. That is what a noted demographer, Mr. Clatworthy, has indicated in his study commissioned for the department. He also gives a breakdown of how many people would likely register on reserve as opposed to off reserve, and what the implications would be then in terms of program and service implications and cost. We have asked the government this question. The government says that while it is looking at it, it does not know what the impact will be on programs such as non-insured health benefits, post-secondary education and if there is an influx of people on a reserve and what happens to the existing housing prices and the need for other services, other types of infrastructure.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="10" Mn="45">(1045)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1831050">While we ask all these questions, we believe the intent of the bill is to try to meet the test or dictates of the B.C. Court of Appeal. We believe it is worthy of support at second reading. We hope it will close one gap in the law, even if it does not address others that remain. It definitely requires full examination in committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831051">Despite the shortened time frame due to the court decision and the government's prorogation, we hope there will be a full and fair hearing with a broad cross-section of witnesses. I look forward to hearing those witnesses and, if possible, to making the bill a better one.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

From what the member has said, my observation is that section 6(c.1)(iv) is very pertinent and of concern to the first nations community. It has introduced a new form of discrimination based on the status of children.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831053">This seems to be the nature of the appeal stemming from the McIvor initiative that attempted to focus on the whole issue of inequity between paternal and maternal rights. The inference I draw from the member's overview is that this added form of discrimination is contrary to the very intent that Sharon McIvor had. In fact, it will contribute to the saying that justice delayed is justice denied.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831054">Is it within the purview of the committee, given that the Court of Appeal really established the parameters of the B.C. decision within which the inequity could be legally addressed, to address that new form of discrimination, or is this a case where we are trying to catch up on bad legislation?</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

It permits recognition of one's origins and the practice of one's culture.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831063">In 1996, many questions were already being raised about the impact of Bill C-31. There were concerns about possible adverse effects on the debate about whether or not someone is a band member, an issue that is not only complex, but also an integral part of a person's identity. To illustrate this complexity, I will read two excerpts from a report prepared by the Library of Parliament in February 1996 and revised in 2003. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831064"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The debate over membership is complex and multifaceted. A consideration of the issue leads to questions about what it means to belong to a community, about who has the right to define community membership, and about the changing nature of the Indian population. For many years, externally imposed rules for status and membership have produced internal divisions within Indian communities. The impacts of Bill C-31 have further emphasized political, social and financial concerns and introduced new problems. </QuotePara></Quote></ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831065"><Quote><QuotePara Align="Left" IndentFirst="2" IndentRest="1">The growth in the number of status Indians living off reserve as a result of Bill C-31 has also increased the need to clarify the responsibilities of federal and provincial governments in providing and funding the services required. Problems have arisen, moreover, because many of the programs and funds for status Indians are available only to those who live on reserve. Some of those who wished to live on reserve could not, however, because of a lack of services, such as housing. Furthermore, despite the increase in services, many off-reserve Bill C-31 registrants did not know how to access them and thus did not take advantage of them. INAC has been criticized for not making this information more readily available.</QuotePara></Quote></ParaText><ParaText id="1831066">These quotes show just how complex recognition is.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831067">Does the implementation of Bill <Document DbId="4336828" Type="3">C-3</Document> raise new questions about the implementation of Bill C-31?

							<ParaText id="1831072">The federal government waited 25 years to introduce a bill recognizing the Indian status of individuals who had been discriminated against in the past.

However, in many cases, these women could not pass this status to their children.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831079">In 1985, Sharon McIvor, a law student from British Columbia and descendant of the Lower Nicola Indian Band—her mother was a status Indian woman and her father a non-status Indian man—applied to regain her status.

We were given no notice whatsoever and it is just now that I have heard the minister's comments.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831378">This is deeply disturbing on a number of levels. First, it shows a pattern of continued disrespect for Parliament and its institutions. It does not give us an adequate opportunity to respond, but particularly to do so on the issue of vaccines, one that obviously has gripped this nation and one with which we have been very concerned, particularly when it deals with those contracts. We had a lot of questions about them because they were sole-sourced. The government decided to put all of its eggs in one basket.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831379">However, also consider the fact that just four months ago the Auditor General slammed the government for not having a plan when it came to emergency preparedness. Now when we are just beginning to get some semblance of action, which is hastily tossed together, we find out that the Conservatives are not discussing these matters with the people who are on the front lines in keeping our communities safe. As an example, when it comes to public health, the key individuals involved in public health, those who ensure our communities are safe or who respond to an emergency situation, were not consulted with the development of this plan. In fact, there is not even a clear chain of command.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831380"> In committee when one of our members asked a question about who was responsible, where the buck stopped, there was a long pause. The witnesses all looked at each other and eventually somebody said “Well, I guess it's me”. For a government that continually peddles in fear, in trying to balloon up issues to get people to be afraid, it is remarkable that it has no plan to actually deal with any of the situations it tries to get people to fear. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831381">It is not just public health. When we talked to the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs, the fire chiefs said that they were not included in the development of an emergency plan at all. They are absolutely irate that fire is not in that plan, that it has been set aside.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831382">We talked with the Canadian Federation of Agriculture about a situation with fertilizer. Today in the House the member for <Affiliation DbId="128448" Type="2">Guelph</Affiliation> asked a question about that. We have a situation where fertilizer is not being secured. The United States gave tax advantages to people to ensure they were able to put proper security measures in place, yet Canada refuses to do that. In fact, ministers have not been responded to letters requesting meetings with them. People feel left in the dark.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831383">When it comes to emergency preparedness and emergency planning, the government is all talk and no action. Even a report from the Auditor General cannot get the Conservatives to get their act together, sit down, talk with the principal stakeholders and ensure the right thing is done.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831384">Whether the government is proroguing Parliament, or cancelling the opinion of independent agencies, such as the Information Commissioner or the RCMP Public Complaints Commissioner, or while it is not scuttling committees, in so many different instances the government shows a complete lack of respect for Parliament, its institutions and, frankly, democracy. Yet again the minister has done it here today. It is unacceptable. This is an unheard of practice to just dump it on the table like this. She should be following the practices of the House and show more respect for an issue of this kind of importance.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

We were advised only this morning that there would be a ministerial statement today even though we received advance notice of the one to be made Monday on World War I, which gives us time to get ready. </ParaText><ParaText id="1831386">In this case, even though there were confidential aspects, we could very well have received the text of the statement and kept it confidential, and the government knows that. Once we were informed of this ministerial statement, we asked for the text of the statement, in order to prepare an adequate response to the announcement. Clearly, we did not get the text before the statement, but we will not do like the government and improvise responses and gestures such as we saw yesterday, for example, with the introduction of 2,500 pages of completely useless redacted documents.</ParaText>

I, too, was taken aback at the lack of notice, but she has shared with us some very useful information to shine light on perhaps the untoward influence of lobbyists in policy-making, at least in the years of the early 2000s, prior to the introduction of the Federal Accountability Act, for which the NDP was proud to vote.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831389">We did not see a printed copy of the statement, but the words that jumped out at me was when the minister mentioned the contingency fees, the success fees, paid out to Wallding International Inc. I note that the key principal of Wallding International Inc. is none other than former senior Liberal cabinet minister David Dingwall, who had well-known and long-standing connections to big pharma in his former capacity as a minister in the Liberal government.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831390">For a Liberal minister of the Crown to cease his duties as a cabinet minister and within a year, go out and influence peddle with big pharma for a sole-source contract worth hundreds of millions of dollars for a pre-set contingency fee is not only fundamentally wrong, it is illegal in my view. The only difference between lobbying and influence peddling is about five years in prison, and influence peddling or selling one's influence, one's access to a company, is nothing short of influence peddling.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831391">The minister has done us a great service by shining a light on this sorry bit of Canadian history. We have all known about the very cozy relationship between the Liberals and big pharma. We have all wondered about the drug patent laws, which were in fact the biggest corporate giveaway since the CPR in terms of giving big pharma almost unlimited drug patent laws. The has been essentially draining the coffers of health care budgets ever since, handing billions of dollars to the select, well connected, influential group of pharmaceutical companies that the Liberals used so well.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831392">We all took note of senior Liberal staffers who were like a revolving door. One day they were working in the minister's office. The next day they were working for Pfizer. The next day they were working for a lobbying company. The next day they were back in the office of the Liberals. It was like a revolving door, which we noticed time and time again, ministerial staff going into big pharma and then back out again, or going into the lobbying industry and selling influence like this.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831393">This is perhaps the most graphic illustration of the rot that crept into the Liberal regime in those years than we have seen since the sponsorship scandal. Mr. Dingwall, who was entitled to his entitlements, clearly thought one of his entitlements was to pillage the health care system by selling this privileged access to big pharma and lining his own pockets in the process. It is fundamentally wrong and I can assure members that our parliamentary committee will be seized of this issue, at the earliest opportunity, to conduct an indepth study of these kinds of shenanigans to ensure they can never happen again.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>

							<ParaText id="1831404">The motion I presented to the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, which was adopted, sought to update existing legislation. Since the 1990s, there has been an exception in the Copyright Act to do with private copying.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831405">The exception allows consumers to copy material for their personal use. In return, they are asked to pay a tiny fee when purchasing the blank medium they use to make copies. Everyone here has paid this fee, and I am sure that I have too. It is 24¢ for audio cassettes, although very few people buy those nowadays. For CDs, the fee is 29¢.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831406">The problem is that CD sales have declined dramatically, but consumption of music has not. There is a problem. Video cassettes are not included in the Copyright Act's private copying exception and never have been.

The technology has become obsolete. </ParaText>

We are not trying to wage a new war. We do not want to change a principle. The principle is already there; it exists in the legislation. We are not trying to create a new one. We simply want to modernize the Copyright Act and add this temporary solution while we wait for a new Copyright Act. Since technology is developing quickly, we are worried that a new technology could already be invented and in use before we have a new Copyright Act and that it will be too late. As I mentioned earlier, we must act quickly.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831411">I would like to give a bit of history. I remind members that in its 2003-04 decision on the private copying tariff, the Copyright Board of Canada approved the application by the Canadian Private Copying Collective, the CPCC, to have levies collected on flash memory cards embedded in iPods and other MP3 players, which the commission designated as digital audio recorders. </ParaText><ParaText id="1831412">The Federal Court then ruled that the commission had erred in its decision and threw out the CPCC's case. Since then, this collective has tried to speed up the modernization of the act and to have it changed to include MP3 players, which is a good thing. The goal is essentially to ensure that artists are paid for their work.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831413">I have an example to show that artists are not always paid for their work. On December 3, the <Affiliation DbId="128698" Type="4">Minister of Industry</Affiliation>, a Conservative minister, gave a radio interview with CBC.

He was unable to clearly state that he had acquired all the tracks legally and that all the music he had downloaded onto his iPod had been paid for in accordance with the Copyright Act.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831415">Yesterday, in the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, a respected university professor, Michael Geist, told us it is not so bad if artists, singers and musicians do not get paid for all their recordings because they can make up for those losses by putting on shows and earn money in other ways. He was reluctant to agree with a levy on MP3s.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831416">I asked him whether he would agree to being hired as a university professor, but not paid. I told him that he is now known as a university professor and he could give talks and find other sources of income. He did not answer my question. In any event, it was not the best of questions; comparisons are always clumsy. Nonetheless, people have to get paid for their work and not just for things they do on the side.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831417">When an artist makes a recording they have to rent a recording studio, and the recording studio does not give shows all across Quebec, Canada or the world.

It ran last Friday, one week ago today. I will read the editorial in French. I tried to translate it, but I am not a professional translator. I have a lot of respect for translators.

We see them on TV, all sparkly and glamorous, but in real life, it is not the same.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831473">In Canada and Quebec, the average artist's income is between $20,000 and $25,000 per year.

There is a five-year commitment to the Canada music fund. The Minister of Canadian Heritage is really leading the cultural sector in this country, and it is exciting to see.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831485">Today, we have been asked to consider a motion proposed by the opposition members in the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, which would tax all iPods, all MP3 players, all cellphones, all BlackBerrys and any other device that can hold media.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831486">As my parliamentary colleagues likely already know, Canada has had a levy equalling less than a dollar on blank recording media such as CDs since 1997. In the intervening years, newer technologies came along with built-in memory to store music and other electronic files.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831487">To properly consider the motion presented before us today, we must be aware of the scope of the issues involved and the related technical details. This is indeed a very complex issue, and there are many views and perspectives that must be considered.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831488">I want to take a few moments to describe the Canadian private copying regime. To begin with, I will remind members of the continuing impact of new technology on the copyright landscape and how it has evolved and continues to evolve in recent times. When music was just available on vinyl records or in live performances, only people with specialized skills and equipment could make copies of it. Even as tape machines became available, the task of making copies was cumbersome and difficult. In addition, there was a noticeable decline in the quality of the first and then subsequent duplications.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831489">I am sure many of us can remember waiting beside the radio with our finger over the “record” button waiting for our favourite top-10 hit. I know in <Affiliation DbId="128261" Type="2">Peterborough</Affiliation> it was 980 CHEX that I was listening to as a kid, and I remember sitting there with my tape recorder, trying to time that song just right. It did not work out very often.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831490">As technology improved, customers found it easier to make copies. It became relatively easy for a consumer, for example, to buy a vinyl record to listen to at home and make a tape of it to listen to in the car. It was just as easy to make an additional copy for a friend or two. This practice became more widespread, and that was a problem. The holders of music copyright were not compensated for the copies of their work. For consumers it was also a problem, because making any copy at all was illegal. </ParaText><ParaText id="1831491">At the same time, enforcing the rules was very difficult. It is one thing to pursue an individual who makes thousands of copies of a single work and then distributes them without the permission of the owner. It is quite another when it is millions of people copying thousands of works. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831492">Canada's private copying regime, created in 1997, was a response to this difficult issue. Since copies were distributed on recordable media, such as CDs, the regime imposed a levy upon them. The moneys collected in this way were then distributed to copyright holders of the works being copied. To do this, the Copyright Act had to be amended to allow consumers to make copies for their private use on some audio recording media. It was also necessary to give Canada's Copyright Board the power to set the levy for each medium. The Copyright Act, which assigns these powers, requires the board to consider three issues when determining these levies: the consumer's ability to pay, the impact of tariffs on black and grey markets, and the public interest.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831493">The system is not intended to compensate owners for each copy of their works made. In fact, it could not be, since it would be impossible to track the necessary data. Nor is the system intended to levy charges in a way that was precisely related to the consumer's actual use of works. The levy is applied irrespective of the actual use of the blank media. The Copyright Board sets the levy taking into account the criteria I mentioned earlier and considering general usage patterns. </ParaText><ParaText id="1831494">The hon. member who spoke just before me talked about the levy on CDs, CDRWs, DVDs and DVDRWs. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="12" Mn="55">(1255)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1831495">Quite often these units of storage are not used for recording music. They are used for recording things like photos. Sometimes students will use them for recording lectures at school so they can review them later. To place a levy or a tax on these media just because they could be used for music is obviously something that a lot of my constituents have often had trouble with. They do not understand why there would be just a blanket charge being placed upon them, on the assumption that is what the storage device would be used for. </ParaText><ParaText id="1831496">The Canadian Private Copying Collective is responsible for receiving these levies and distributing them to the rights holders. Based in Toronto, this non-profit agency represents songwriters, recording artists, music publishers and record companies. In the 13 years since its inception, the Canadian Private Copying Collective has stated that it has distributed over $180 million to copyright holders in the music sector.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831497">The notion that Canadians should pay an additional tax on recordable media to compensate copyright holders appears to have become generally accepted, although as I noted, there are ongoing debates.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831498">I should note that consumers purchasing CDs were not necessarily aware of it. In fact often, when I talk to folks in my constituency to ask their opinion on the motion that has been brought forward by the hon. member, I am surprised how many people are not aware that they have been paying this tax for some time. And when they find out about it, they are not necessarily happy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831499">One could say Canadians have accepted their new rights to make copies for private use, but I do not think that would be accurate either. A more precise way to put it would be to say that an already widespread practice has become even more so.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831500">Technology once again has radically changed the game that these rules, established in 1997, were meant to govern. Herein lies the problem. New challenges have emerged. For example, an MP3 player about the size of a credit card can store more music than was once held in an entire boxful of CDs. I own hundreds of CDs. I have purchased them all, but despite all the racks and shelves I have to hold these CDs, I can now store all of them on a device that I could fit in my pocket. In fact it would be smaller than my car keys.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831501">Today consumers can easily download and listen to music from online sources or from previously owned copies without ever needing to purchase a recordable medium such as a CD. However there are many means by which to download media, on websites such as iTunes, where consumers pay for the music and files they download.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831502">The opposition is suggesting that the Copyright Board simply place an extra tax on all devices that are able to store these media, which could result in a tax as high as $80 per device, and that is just on an iPod. This is where we get into the difficult argument on this. </ParaText><ParaText id="1831503">I asked this of the hon. member a few moments ago. She was using a tax, although she used the word levy, of $25 on a 30-gigabyte iPod, but for home computers the hard drive capacity is now measured in terabytes, which is significantly more. How therefore would we determine the tax or levy on a device with that much memory? This is clearly a problem.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831504">Not surprisingly, the tribunals and courts that adjudicate copyright law in Canada were asked to rule on the matter of taxing new media devices. I am not going to go into all the details of the various decisions, however the salient point is that the final decision by the Federal Court of Appeal on January 10, 2008, excluded memory in digital audio recorders, such as MP3 players, from the Canadian private copying regime. That was the decision of an independent judiciary.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831505">The motion adopted by the opposition members on the Standing Committee on Heritage proposes to amend the Copyright Act to bring such devices under the regime. The motion provides us with the opportunity to further consider the debate over the private copying regime. What are the challenges? What are the possible solutions? And what do Canadians want? That is something that all members in this House would do well to consider.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831506">This debate may help shed light on the preferences of Canadians and the impact of recent court decisions in the scope of the regime. It is also important that we consider whether we need to approach this debate from a micro or a macro perspective. Should we begin by considering the forest, or do we want to focus on the trees? </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831507">Should we begin, as this motion proposes, by considering one possible solution to a particular problem? Following this line of thought, we would ask ourselves whether or not we should amend the law such that MP3 players are not included in the private copying regime.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="13" Mn="00">(1300)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1831508">Thus, let me suggest we take a more holistic perspective and think about the broader issues. As I said a moment ago, we should be considering the effect on all Canadians, the effect on business, the effect on students, the effect on the everyday constituents we all represent. That is the holistic approach we should be taking.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831509">Before the adoption of this motion, our government had already begun thinking about the larger issues related to copyright law in Canada.

As the Speaker would well know, one of these copyright consultations was held in Peterborough, where stakeholders from right across the spectrum took part. We also held them in major centres right across the country, such as Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. In all sectors of the country consultations were heard, and a very diverse group of Canadians came forward to talk about these complex issues.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831511">A simple review of the results of the consultation process shows us that Canadians are clearly aware and care deeply about the issue of copyright. </ParaText>

In each of these venues and in online discussions, we asked Canadians to respond to questions covering five types of issues. </ParaText><ParaText id="1831514">We asked them about how copyright law affects their individual lives.

On the one hand, having been used to making copies of music that they have legally acquired, they wish to be free to continue to do so with minimal restrictions. Others are concerned with format shifting. Having purchased music in one format, they wonder why they should pay an additional tax or fee on a new device to which they will transfer these files.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831522">Members will remember my story about all the CDs I have purchased. At some point, when I have a bit more time on my hands, I would not mind taking all those CDs and putting them onto a digital device. The question is whether, when I make that format shift, I should have to pay for all of those recordings again, because I have already purchased them once. That is something a lot of folks come to me about. They feel that if they have bought a CD they should not have to pay again. But certainly this motion would see all folks charged a levy or a tax, as I see it, on the devices onto which they would actually transfer those media.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831523">In short, we are faced with the challenge of addressing a number of different interests and views, while ensuring Canada continues to be well positioned in today's global economy.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831524">Our government recognizes that to succeed in today's global economy, Canada must keep step as the world races forward. The relentless pace of technology means every day there is something newer, faster and better. We are committed to strengthening laws governing intellectual property and copyright to encourage new ideas and protect the rights of Canadians whose research, development and artistic creativity continue to contribute to Canada's prosperity.

The second bill the government brought forward died on the order paper when the government called an early election, and we have not seen a bill since, though we keep hearing promises.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831544">What is interesting to note is that even when the Conservatives did bring in a bill and finally tabled it in the House, they continued to be committed to a levy on blank CDs and tapes.

One would think the government would do that. My hon. colleague is right: I would not want to give the Conservatives that idea. It would be like giving them a free license to eliminate all money available to the artists who needed it. I retract that statement. God forbid the government actually follows through on that one. However, this is a complete and utter paradox. </ParaText><ParaText id="1831566">The reason I am happy to see this on the floor today is that we are debating an issue that is so complex it has yet to have a full hearing in this House, and are doing so before receiving actual legislation dealing with copyright.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831567">On one side of the House, members say that any money flowing to the government is really not such a good thing.

Of course, we all know about that, so I will not go on about it.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831568">However, what I do like about this particular motion is that whether or not one believes in paying the fee and whether or not one thinks it will benefit artists, the debate has to be heard. </ParaText><ParaText id="1831569">There is a gentleman in my riding, Kevin Blackmore, from Glovertown in Newfoundland and Labrador. His group is called Buddy Wasisname and the Other Fellers. Members will have heard of them. They have a great name. They are one of the most famous groups of folk artists we have ever seen out Newfoundland and Labrador. Kevin lives in my riding and he brought up a good point. He said that the way music is proliferating through the digital media, the way it is zipped around the world and so many copies are made so quickly, it is getting to the point where it was when popular music first began, which is to say that for an artist the only way, the only way, of achieving any revenue is to have a concert. A recording will not garner it. In those days, nobody was making money from any recording, but nowadays these things are flying around the world instantaneously. Artists sweat tears and blood in doing their work. It gets sent around the world instantaneously. Somebody out there is making money and it is not the person who put the effort into that piece of art. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831570">That is what we need to consider. That is what we need to look at. That is what we need to debate. Do not ridicule any revenue going to an artist as if it were being taken from someone for no reason at all. There is a benefit. </ParaText><ParaText id="1831571">That is the problem with what we just heard. No one is talking about the benefit that an artist provides to the general public. That is the debate that needs to be held. Who has the incentive to entertain us, if we do not have the right business model for them to live within and spend a full career doing music? </ParaText><ParaText id="1831572">This is not just about the rich artists who drive around in limos and who appear on red carpets, to use a previous analogy.

That is key to what we need to do.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831574">My hon. colleague was challenged on a point that would include not just iPods and blackberries but all sorts of devices. The parliamentary secretary did have one valid point, which was the convergence of technologies, because it comes to a point where internal memory devices proliferate across the board. However, he is missing the intent of what is happening here. </ParaText><ParaText id="1831575">We are dealing with MP3s, which is a medium by which music is being played, and we need to consider that what we do in one needs to be good for the other. In other words, yes, six eggs are fine but six eggs are broken and now I must go back to the store and get half a dozen eggs. However, if we do that, we need to do it right. The only way as parliamentarians we will come to terms with providing artists with a decent living is to have and flesh out this debate here in the House. I therefore warn everybody in the House not to stifle this debate.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831576">We are a part of a Canadian system that supports our artists. One of the greatest models to use about supporting artistry in this country is actually in the province of Quebec. I had the honour of living in Quebec for five years. In Quebec there is what they call a star system by which their artists, francophone mostly but some anglophone, benefit from this system by which their material but also them as artists are promoted in a context that is global.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831577">The world is becoming much smaller. In the 1960s and 1970s the global village was this big and now it is this big.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831578">I would caution the people in this House to look at this as an issue that is far-encompassing, one that is just beyond levies, taxes and fees, despite the fact that we get riled up into terminology as to what is what. As I said before, if this tax is so bad then obviously the other one on CDs is just as bad but nobody wants to get rid of that one. Why is that? It is because it is of great benefit to our artists and they have told us so each and every time.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831579">However, CD sales are declining dramatically. HMV was one of the great stalwarts of business but not so much anymore. Some might blame it on the Walmarts of the world, the big box stores, but we need to lay some of that blame on the changing landscape of digital media.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831580">We not only need to stay ahead of the curve here, we need to be in lockstep with what is going on. I have it said before and I will say it again, when it comes to legislation to clamp down on things, such as piracy and peer-to-peer sharing, we can spend a full year trying to decide how we will legislate this. We can put it in place in this House legislation that actually tries to eliminate piracy, digital locks and the like.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831581">However, here is the problem. My son turns 16 today and I wish him a happy birthday. He is very adept at technology. We can put in legislation over a period of year but I will give my 16-year-old, like any other 16-year-old, 48 hours to get around it. We need to keep up.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831582">I think this debate will contribute to how we can keep up, to allow artists to be artists and to make a living being artists, but at the same time allowing our 16-year-olds to actually enjoy the music, and not just the music of the famous stars but the ones who are trying to make a living doing this.</ParaText>

He should check it out.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831587">The thing is that it is quality programming, quality jobs and, when I say artists are involved, it is not just the actors we see on the screen. It is the people doing the lights, the make-up and the people behind the scenes creating scenery and making the wardrobe. They, too, are artists.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831588">Getting back to music, we need to consider what we are doing. Michael Geist talks about copyright and says that it “...is an important part of a government new-media strategy”.

What existed offline now exists online. That is what my hon. colleague is trying to point out here with the particular article to amend by saying that we are shifting into the digital age.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831591">People may not like that specific wording and they may think that applies to other types of media but debate is wholesome and good because now we need to make this shift. If Michael Geist gets it, I guarantee everyone our kids get it too. We need to stay in lockstep with them in order to make this happen.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831592">The offline world was the CD. It was what we had to do in the Copyright Act to ensure artists were compensated. The origin of this was back in the late 1990s. The private copying collective developed a methodology by which proceeds are distributed to rights holders based on commercial radio air play and commercial sales samples. Radio college air play was ignored. There we have a good debate. Radio air play was ignored because it does not have the revenues to pay for this.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831593">This private copyright machine was borne out of a wholesome debate that we had to compensate the artists, but at the same time allowing access that was fair for people who wanted to use it. However, we are way behind on this. I will illustrate a point. The countries of this world worked out WIPO legislation, world intellectual properties, and they signed a treaty. We have not ratified it. It was signed in 1996, for goodness sake. We are way behind. We have acknowledged it in committee. Our chair knows this is a valid point and raised the point as well. We both said that we needed to look at this and debate it because we were away behind. </ParaText>

He talked about copyright, and look out.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831595">Right now we are working out a comprehensive free trade agreement with Europe and Europe is ahead of us on copyright.

I am not quite sure of the analogy yet but as I stand here and speak I think I am starting to understand it and, brother, that is scary. It is six of one and half a dozen of the other, but six are broken. Maybe I do get it now. Maybe six eggs are broken, and the only way they will be fixed is if everyone in the House has an honest, clear and open debate about artists, their revenue and, of course, our kids who use that for entertainment.

All members know what I am talking about and they know exactly who I am talking about.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831598">The proliferation of media is incredible, not just in Canada but around the world. We just happen to live next door. How do we promote an artist in this country? We do it with things like compelling radio stations that 33% of what they play on the air must be Canadian. Did our artists benefit from that? I like to think so.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831599">I guess the only artists in Canada who can say that they reached the pinnacle of music success and they did not benefit from the rule changes was probably The Guess Who. However, since then, they all have. Where would Céline Dion and Bryan Adams be without these rules? Where would these smaller groups of artists be without this levy that was fully debated in the House in the late 1990s? </ParaText><ParaText id="1831600">I do not have the numbers but that is a basket of eggs that they gleefully accepted and will continue to accept because it is not a question of added bonus. It is a question of the existence of the Canadian system. So let us not stray away from going after each other. Let us focus on what we were doing.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831601">I think the other issue is that many people are doing peer-to-peer sharing. What that means is that they are getting music on line, downloading it and not paying a single soul for it. Whether it is right or wrong, people are losing money and not making money on the effort they put into their artistry.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831602">What are we going to do? We are going to have this debate and try to find that business model to allow these people to keep doing what they are doing or else the quality of music will go down and down because artists will find absolutely no incentive to get involved because they cannot make a living at it. </ParaText><ParaText id="1831603">The second part is that many of our kids are downloading this music and do not even realize that they are breaking the law. </ParaText><ParaText id="1831604">Therefore, we need a wholesome debate and one that is true to what we represent in the House, which is the best for Canada, our artists and the user, the kids and adults who actually listen to music. This is a national debate.</ParaText>

In the House, day after day and week after week, we see that the nation of Quebec is in a different situation and that its needs are different.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831685">For example, this week, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission revealed a new regulatory policy for television. One aspect of this policy is that from now on, television broadcasters can reduce their Canadian content, and thus their Quebec content as well, from 60% to 55%.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831686">This measure is essentially aimed at Canada and not at all at Quebec. Why? Because in Quebec, Quebec content is much higher than 60%. I do not have the exact figures, but during prime time, Quebec television stations must be broadcasting nearly 80% Quebec content.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831687">Accordingly, Quebec does not face the same problems the rest of Canada does. Are Quebec's problems easier to resolve? I do not know, but they are different and they have to be treated differently.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831688">We have different problems and a different language. However, in Quebec, there is a real star system and everything we need to nourish it. There is an audience that eats up artistic activities of any kind and that loves Quebec artists and their art. Quebeckers keep asking for more; the television ratings prove it. When there is a Quebec production, a new series or a show by a Quebec artist, the public happily tunes in to watch the program.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831689">The Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage has heard from many witnesses and we have noted that the same thing is not happening elsewhere in Canada. Other areas have difficulty producing Canadian content and when they do produce it, they have difficulty attracting an audience, likely because of the language. But I am not here to do such an analysis; Canadians can do it for themselves.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831690">Last year the vice-president of CBC/Radio-Canada said that Canadians are the only people in the world who prefer their neighbour's television. That is not at all the case in Quebec. We are very lucky; we have everything we need. Our artists are good, we enjoy them and we do not have such problems.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831691">When we see the CRTC lowering the requirements in terms of Canadian content, we know that this is not for us. While the commission notes that our problems are different, it always ends up proposing solutions that are enforced from coast to coast to coast, in Canada and in Quebec. Yet these solutions do not suit Quebeckers, because they do not correspond at all to our reality.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831692">When we talk about Quebec's problems and values, and about the Quebec nation, the other members of this House believe it is only natural, because we are sovereignists and all we want is Quebec independence. However, I have a letter here from Quebec's Minister of Culture, Communications and the Status of Women, Christine St-Pierre. She is not a sovereignist or a separatist. She is a Liberal, a federalist and a member of Jean Charest's government, Charest being a former Conservative leader, no less.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831693">Ms. St-Pierre wrote to the <Affiliation DbId="128706" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Heritage</Affiliation> on March 23, 2009.

But I will come back to that.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831694">I would like to read the letter because it is extremely important in the history of Quebec culture and communications.

In reflection, I want to make a couple of comments before I get into the body of the text of my speech about the cultural identity of the various regions within Canada.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831708">I do not think it is fair to the folks in St. John's, Newfoundland, for example, to say that they are not culturally distinct from Calgary, Alberta, or that Victoria, British Columbia does not have its own cultural identity that might be somewhat different from Peterborough. It is a strength in Canada that we have all of these culturally distinct regions and that we all come together under one flag and one nation.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831709">We certainly saw in the Vancouver 2010 Olympics. We did not just see our athletes dominate, which by the way was spectacular. We also saw our artists. We also saw Canadians celebrating in the streets. We saw a collective strength of a nation, the likes of which I have never seen. That collective strength is supported by regions of the country that are as diverse from one another as one could possibly imagine. However, they have one thing in common, and that is a love of this nation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831710">I am very pleased to have this opportunity to comment on matters relevant to the regulation of broadcasting and telecommunications activities in Canada. Given proposals contained in Bill <Document DbId="4328473" Type="4">C-444</Document>, I believe we must take the time to consider the impact they would have on Canadian consumers, including those in Quebec.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831711">We strongly believe that creating additional regulatory frameworks, as proposed under Bill <Document DbId="4328473" Type="4">C-444</Document>, could only lead to extraordinary confusion and complication. Then innovation and competitiveness in Canada's vital communications would be stifled to the detriment of Canadian consumers and the businesses that serve them.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831712">Given the current challenges confronting the broadcasting industry, the convergence of broadcasting and telecommunications, such a division of responsibilities risks introducing complexities and inefficiencies into the system that could hamper the competitiveness and the ability of companies to respond to new market and technological developments.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831713">Let me elaborate on this point. We are all aware of the fact that Canada's broadcasting and telecommunications systems are in the midst of a fundamental transformation. We have talked about that on other matters before the House today. Important changes are being brought on by the rapid adoption of digital technologies, which are modifying Canada's communications landscape in unprecedented ways.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831714">Established companies are facing competition from unexpected players. Lines between industries, companies, devices, platforms and content are blurring and, in some cases, completely disappearing. More and more, these developments are allowing Canadians to take greater control and participate actively in the creation and distribution of diverse Canadian content.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831715">The rise of digital networks and platforms is also dissolving the territorial and technical boundaries that formerly limited Canadian companies, including Quebec firms, from reaching and exploiting global audiences. These very positive developments must not be restrained by additional layers of rules and regulations.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831716"> Clearly, the future economic potential of our communications companies is bright. Innovative businesses are responding with cutting-edge ideas designed to meet new consumer behaviours and expectations. We must avoid measures that could prevent them from harnessing the potential of the digital technologies that will contribute even more to Canadian competitiveness.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831717">Canadian and Quebec entrepreneurs recognize that unnecessary complication brought on by jurisdictional splitting and the duplication of regulations in all likelihood would hinder their future growth and competitiveness. In question period, I had a number of questions from the hon. member from Quebec who spoke just previously. I quoted Mr. Pierre Karl Péladeau from Quebecor. I indicated that we as a government believed that Canadians wanted less regulation, not more.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831718">Here is what this leading Quebec business person and leading broadcaster in Quebec had to say about the equivalent of a CRTC in Quebec. He said, “A Quebec equivalent of the CRTC would complicate, not simplify things. My position is fairly clear. I believe the solution is the deregulation of the industry”. That is what a gentleman from Quebec in the industry had to say. It is in the complete opposite direction of the Bloc's Bill <Document DbId="4328473" Type="4">C-444</Document>.</ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="20">(1420)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1831719">Adding complexity to regulation, which the passing of Bill <Document DbId="4328473" Type="4">C-444</Document> would most certainly accomplish, would only hinder the capacity of our industries to meet the promising opportunities ahead to further develop and prosper and continue to offer Canadians a diversity of content and service choices.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831720">Our government, which has a record of putting consumers first, strongly believes that fragmenting regulatory control and supervision would not be serving Canadians, including Quebeckers, well. In fact, they would be poorly served. Such action would result in additional cost and uncertainty for consumers across the country. This is of great concern to us and that is why we are formally opposed to Bill <Document DbId="4328473" Type="4">C-444</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831721">Just previous to the debate on this bill, we talked about an issue, which I and the minister have termed as the "itax". It may be the simplest way to convey what we talked about a bit earlier. It is the recognition of digital technologies in the ever emerging landscape. We have to acknowledge that there is tremendous platform change occurring not only in this country but globally.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831722">Today we live in an era where every person in the House, every person from coast to coast to coast in this nation could become a broadcaster if they wanted. All they need is a camera and a home computer. It is easy. That is the context in which we live. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831723">Trying to put barriers around things and trying to put constructs up like what we built in the sixties, simply will not work in a modern media context, in a modern broadcast environment. The complexities and regulations that the bill would seek to put in place upon the province of Quebec would hinder, not assist, the Quebec cultural economy and artists in Quebec. </ParaText><ParaText id="1831724">Everyone in the House can acknowledge that the cultural sector in Canada has really hit its stride, whether those artists are from Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, either of the territories, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, it does not matter. Canada has hit its stride culturally. We are leading the world when it comes to cultural innovations and creativity.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831725"> I am so proud of Canadian artists. What they do not need is a new regulatory body that would seek to hinder and restrict them with new regulations that would simply seek to rebuild something that existed from the past.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831726">The Great Wall of China at one point was probably a very effective tool to keep invading armies on the one side, while those on the other side were safe. The Great Wall of China would not be very effective in defending a nation these days. The new technologies that have come in demonstrate that the walls of the past are simply very easily overcome. </ParaText></Content></Intervention>

At the outset, I want to note that the Liberals and the Conservatives seem to be onside, once again opposing this legislation. We saw them yesterday join together as one to try to support Bill <Document DbId="4333701" Type="3">C-2</Document>, the Canada-Colombia free trade agreement. Today we see them join together to try to stop Bill <Document DbId="4328473" Type="4">C-444</Document>.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831728">At second reading we are dealing with the principle of the bill. I would think the Conservatives and particularly the Liberals should be open-minded enough to at least want to send the bill to committee so they could debate it, discuss it and try to amend it, If they do not agree with it at that point, after the amendment process is concluded, by all means, they can come back to the House and vote against it. However, to simply preclude the possibility of the bill going to committee is a very bad choice on their part.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831729">The member who spoke for the Conservatives pointed out that we did not need a new regulatory body, that we did not need duplication of existing regulations. However, he is not prepared to give us the chance to even debate the issue further, to explore the issue in committee, perhaps call witnesses to the committee, look at the issue from all different angles and perhaps come up with a solution that would make everyone happy in the House, particularly the member who introduced Bill <Document DbId="4328473" Type="4">C-444</Document>. He is prepared to shut the door tight right at the beginning, defeat the bill and move on.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831730"> I do not think that is a good approach, particularly since the government finds itself in a minority situation. By the looks of it, it will always be in a minority situation. I see there are signs that it is beginning to accept that fact. There are some signs that it is tentatively making approaches to the opposition. I see it selectively dealing with the Liberals on the Canada-Colombia free trade issue and certainly dealing with other parties on other issues. I applaud it for that because it means it will survive longer as a minority government and it will, at a certain point, learn how to govern properly in a minority situation.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831731">Up until now, it has been more or less a disaster for the government in the minority situation. Clearly from the very beginning, it could never accept the idea it was a minority and so it gave up on the idea, very early on, of trying to make a minority government work. It is going to take it a while to learn. There are some signs it is learning, but this is not one of them. The government should at least be open-minded enough to send the bill to committee.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831732">My colleague from <Affiliation DbId="128327" Type="2">Vancouver Kingsway</Affiliation> also spoke on this issue earlier today. He had indicated that the bill opened up a potential debate for members of the House to deal with public broadcasting and cultural policy in the country. My party and I are very strong believers in public broadcasting. I am a very strong supporter of the CBC. Many members here are of the same age or older than I am and will know that when we were growing up we only got one channel. It was the CBC and it was in black and white, so we had a very positive view of CBC programming in those days.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831733">Things have developed and things have changed over the years. We now have multiple stations competing for the viewers and we have introduced the private sector. </ParaText>
							<Timestamp Hr="14" Mn="30">(1430)</Timestamp><ParaText id="1831734">The government, that is basically very dedicated to whatever the private sector wants, the private sector gets, is tied to deregulation. If we could redraw the map from a Conservative point of view, we would sell off or dismantle the CBC, turnover the whole market to the private sector, and while we did all of that, we would dismantle all the regulations. We would allow free enterprise to run its course.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831735">We would have a situation develop where we would have the big guys gobbling up the little guys to the point where we would have just one or two broadcasters, media giants, in Canada and that is in fact what has happened.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831736">Then we get to deal with the whole issue of the too big to fail syndrome. We have a situation right now with CanWest essentially going into bankruptcy because the original owners and founders of the company managed to load the company with $5 billion of debt. Then when the market downturn happened and the economy dove a couple of years ago, the bond holders were forced to take over the company. Now we see them basically selling off the assets to other corporate takers and that process is ongoing at this point.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831737">Coupled with that we find ourselves in the middle of an extreme recession and the government announced last year that it was planning to sell off crown assets to, I believe, realize $2 billion.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831738">I am not aware that it was able to do any of that last year, but I know the <Affiliation DbId="128843" Type="18">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance</Affiliation> is listening very attentively and taking notes, I might add, and I am certain that this coming year the government will find a way to realize that $2 billion and maybe more by selling off public assets.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831739">We on this side of the House have suggested that one of those public assets that it may be interested in selling off might be the CBC. </ParaText><ParaText Interjection="e1" id="1831740"><Affiliation DbId="128632" Type="2">Mr. Richard Harris</Affiliation>: That's not going to happen.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831741"><Affiliation DbId="128453">Mr. Jim Maloway: </Affiliation>The member says that is nonsense and that is not going to happen. Stranger things have happened from Conservative governments.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831742">If the member says that is not going to happen, well then what is the government going to sell off? If the government is not going to sell off all or part of the CBC, privatize the CBC, then it should provide me a list of what it is going to sell off. The government has indicated that it is going to sell off $2 billion in assets. If it is not the CBC, then the member should tell me what it is. </ParaText><ParaText id="1831743">The member now wants some suggestions. The member has the balance sheet of the government and it knows what the assets are. Believe me, it knows what it is planning to sell. I think the government is working quietly behind the scenes and maybe not so quietly to interest the private sector in buying.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831744">OMERS has indicated that it is going to cash. It is going to set aside huge amounts of cash to do exactly what I have just been talking about: purchase government assets. If OMERS is doing that, then the other pension funds will be in the same situation. We will see what happens with the government.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831745">As I said, I would suggest that the CBC is certainly on that list of items that the government is planning to divest itself of in the next little while. If it does not do it, it is not going to be for want of trying. It will bend over backwards to package that corporation, that asset, to make it as attractive as possible to the private sector, in essence I submit almost make it a point where it will practically pay the private sector to take it over.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831746">With that, Mr. Speaker, I understand my time is up and I thank you very much for your time.</ParaText>

They had two major concerns about a vote on the bill. I will try one last time to convince them. </ParaText><ParaText id="1831749">However, before anything else, I would like to thank the member for <Affiliation DbId="128139" Type="2">Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert</Affiliation> from the bottom of my heart for her excellent work as culture critic for the Bloc Québécois. She has done an excellent job and is always professional.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831750">One of the first concerns brought up by the Liberals was the issue of where the bill came from. It all started with Louis-Alexandre Taschereau in 1929, who was the Liberal Premier of Quebec at the time. The letter from Ms. St-Pierre to the Conservatives' <Affiliation DbId="128706" Type="4">Minister of Canadian Heritage and Official Languages</Affiliation> shows this. Historically, the Government of Quebec has always insisted that it should play a role in broadcasting and telecommunications. In 1929, it was the first government to legislate the broadcasting sector, given the need to safeguard Quebec culture and identity. </ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831751">The Government of Quebec believes that the federal government must not act alone when it comes to broadcasting and telecommunications, and it would like to see the creation of concrete input mechanisms for the development and definition of federal policies, particularly concerning decisions related to activities that primarily affect Quebec and concerning content. </ParaText><ParaText id="1831752">A Liberal minister is calling for the creation of a CQRT. Robert Bourassa called for that as well, as did Liza Frulla. We see that the Liberals have every reason to support their provincial colleagues and even their former colleague, Liza Frulla who, at the time, was herself a minister under the federal Liberal government.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831753">We see that it would be in the Liberals best interest to continue in the logic they are trying to apply. Of course, knowing Liberal wisdom, when it comes time to vote in the House, there may be a different outcome.</ParaText>
							<ParaText id="1831754">The second concern was expressed by the Conservatives. They did not understand the importance of the CQRT and said it could create new regulations, a new organization and new problems. There would not be much more administration and bureaucracy; the intent is to decentralize. The Conservatives, the right-wing ideologues, should actually be in agreement with the idea of decentralization. Is it not logical that, by allowing the provinces to legislate in this area and to manage their own broadcasting commissions, there would be less administration and bureaucracy, which is in keeping with right-wing thinking?</ParaText><ParaText id="1831755">The Conservatives would thus be very interested in voting for this bill for this as well as another reason. They recognized the Quebec nation in the House and it was voted on. Would passing this bill not be a fantastic tool and would it not give substance to the recognition of the Quebec nation? Instead of being just window dressing, this recognition would have real benefits for Quebec.</ParaText><ParaText id="1831756">Those are two very good arguments directed at the Conservatives. As for the Liberals, they should follow in the footsteps of such colleagues as Ms. Frulla.</ParaText></Content></Intervention>
